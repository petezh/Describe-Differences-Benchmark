"About a week ago, my 2 1/2 year old started complaining about hip pains, which happens every single growth spurt. So, we've got about a week or two to restock her closet.

"I'm using a throwaway, so I apologize in advance. I have been exclusively pumping for 8 months now, and I do supplement with formula. I take Domperidone to help with my supply issues. However, the past month I have had an issue with my right breast. This breast is the one who produces much less milk. It started off as just a cracking/bleeding issue, which I though lanolin was helping, but as time has progressed, I now have a large circle around my nipple that is completely pink, along with little red spots on the outside. The cracking/bleeding still happens every few days, and I've tried adjusting the suction on my pump to help, but I can't get it to fully heal.

Now that he can crawl, pull up, and cruise, naptimes are becoming dangerous - I build a pillow fort around him so he won't crawl off the bed! I don't want to stop cosleeping at night, but I need to get him in a crib for naps for safety's sake and putting the bed on the floor isn't an option for us. What's the best way to go about doing this? I figure it's a two-problem deal - the first, HOW he goes to sleep, and the second, WHERE he goes to sleep.",1,sleeping

"Hi ladies! I've just started EP as of four weeks ago and have been making the best out of a bad situation. Unfortunately our little guy came three weeks early and was having a difficult time latching. We met with numerous lactation consultants, tried a nipple shield, etc but the frustration trying to breastfeed him outweighed the benefits. So with that being said, I have a question I'm hoping someone on here can answer for me! \n\nSince EP, I've noticed my nipples and areola becoming very sore after pumping. This happens even after pumping on the lowest setting possible for 25-30 minutes. I've started using ""Boob-Ease"" pumping lubrication to help with friction and even changed the flange size for my Medela pump. Is this normal? Also, not sure if this has any correlation but there are little bumps (Montgomery glands possibly?) around my nipples that feel sore as well and when pressed, excrete milk. Could these be plugged?",1,breastfeeding

"My daughter will be one next month. A few months ago, I noticed that she had a large ridge that runs from the middle of her head to the top of her forehead. It has not gone away, and if anything, it has gotten more prominent. I was not worried at first, but last week I noticed that her soft spot is very, very hard to feel. I'm not sure it's even there. I know that it is way too early for her soft spot to close... right?    \n\nIt's been a rough six months, and I am trying really hard to not fear the worst... but my gut is telling me that it is not normal. If she was younger, maybe. But everything that I have read has suggested that ridges should be smoothed out by now.    \n\nHer one year appointment is in a couple of weeks, and I will definitely be bringing it up.

"Hey guys,\n\nnew dad here :) I was wondering to have your opinion until the date to the doctor comes. We have a 2.5-month baby boy and he's been gaining weight quite slowly for the past 1.5 month. From the hospital we came back with him then the weight was around 3.2 kg. Then the first month passed and he was up +1kg (~4.2 kg). Now more than a month passed and he's only ~4.6 kg.\nThe eating habits didn't change much, every 2-3 hours he's eating well. And after the meal he's in a good mood, so we're presuming that he's full. I even tracked how much he ate, so that turned out to be around 70-80 g. \n\nNow my question, how far are the ""normal"" boundaries? After all, the first few months should be when the baby gains the highest percentage relative to his weight.\n\nThanks! \n\np.s.

"\n I love AP. That is what I would naturally choose if there wasn't a name for it.

I am bedsharing with her so I can get more rest but ideally I'd have her sleep on her own mattress (which is next to mine on the floor). \n\nI feed her to sleep for every nap and at night. I have had some other mums tell me they got their babies to sleep longer by spacing out feedings (so therefore giving longer feeds). Currently I put baby on the boob probably every couple of hours and she only has short feeds. \n\nHas anyone been in the same situation and can offer advice? I don't know how long a 6 month old can comfortably go between feeds, or how this will change as she gets older. Also, if I space her feeds out does that mean I should stop feeding her to sleep? Will that likely encourage longer stretches at night? \n\nTIA :) ",1,sleeping
I have the Mandela Pump and Style Advanced that is 27mm.

Am I doing it wrong? I got most of that from the breast she didn't nurse from and it was flowing nice for a few minutes then nothing. Any advice or will it just get better later on?,1,breastfeeding

"I've been pumping for about 3 months now. I had noticed over the last few days that I wasn't getting as much as normal (one session for me usually gets about 5-7 oz depending on how engorged I am, sometimes I can get 9 oz but that is rare). So I changed my membranes on my pump and holy hell, 5oz out of one boob after I just nursed the babeh on my other one. Change your membranes! It makes a difference, they do get worn out and as far as I can tell they just weren't causing the right amount of suction anymore.

I have to go out of town without my 15 month old. I don't have a choice. This will be our first time apart. I'm a Stay at home mom. He won't take bottles at all but will take a sippy cup with milk. He still nurses almost 4 times a day. I'm concerned the sippy cup won't be enough to sustain him. He always just kind of sips at it and throws it away. I don't want to try to even introduce bottles this late. Should I just give him the sippy cup with breast milk while I'm gone and hope he figured it out? I don't want to wean him until he is ready. I will be gone for 5 days and will be pumping. Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do?,1,breastfeeding

"Well, basically what the title says. How old are your kids, and approx. how long does it take from going to bed to you leaving their room (kid sleeping or not, but handles the falling asleep on their own from there on).\n\n\nReason I'm asking is I've got a 2 year old that takes hours every night to fall asleep, even when she's really tired. Got an older one that is slightly 'better' but it easily takes 1h+ to get her to sleep and we can't leave her on her own until she's asleep. \n\n\nIt's starting to get to me because it takes so much time out if every night, and handling it alone (when me or my wife is the only one at home) is really tricky so we avoid that as much as we can.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add that I know these things change over time and sometimes even from one week to the next.

"I recently knit a wool cover (vanilla pattern) from 100% wool yarn. I lanolized it twice according to [these instructions](http://www.diaperjunction.com/lanolizing-wool-covers.html) using baby shampoo and Lansinoh lanolin, letting it air dry in between the two lanolizing treatments. However, it doesn't seem to be waterproof. I've tried it a few times with an absorbent fitted diaper underneath, and every time there have been leaks after ~two hours. The cover itself doesn't feel particularly damp, but if LO has any clothes on over the cover, they get damp. \n\nIs there something I'm doing wrong here? Should I try felting the diaper? Use Eucalan instead of baby shampoo? I've read comments in other threads saying hand knit diapers don't need to be felted to be waterproof as long as they're lanolized, but something's not working.

I was pumping every three hours like clockwork and was able to build up a stash. Today I made the mistake of taking a longer nap and missed two pumping sessions. Now when I pump I notice I\u2019m not producing nearly as much as I was. I\u2019m worried about being able to keep up with my baby\u2019s need to eat every two to three hours. \n\nOther than going back to my every three hours pumping schedule, can anyone suggest any other tips to get supply up? I REALLY don\u2019t want to go to exclusively formula. I\u2019m passionate about breastfeeding and if I can\u2019t have her directly to breast I at least want to give her the benefit of my milk. \n\nThanks in advance from a seriously desperate first time mom.

"For those of you with bio kids with your current partner..... is it emotional to have kids that stay with you all the time and kids that stay with their other parent sometimes? It\u2019s a far off decision for me but my SO desperately wants a large family. He has a son, I have two daughters. If we decide to add another of our own, I\u2019m wondering how I\u2019ll feel about that child in relation to my \u201cfirst\u201d kids. I hate that I sort of feel like an additional child would somehow change the dynamic with my two,  I have 70% custody.

my daughter is 21 months old and i know were entering the prime potty training time. others have their kids working on it by this age but my daughter seems completely unaware of the whole thing. she only occasionally even notices when she's messy. i dont want to push her if its too soon but i dont even really know how to breach the topic with her and have her understand.. should i just wait until she's older? or should i really start pushing this? she's our first so she doesnt have any older siblings to look up to. i would just love any input! thanks!,1,potty training

I have an Ameda double electric breast pump.  I just noticed that on one side the diaphragm at the top drastically deflates while the other diaphragm only goes in a little.  On the side that drastically deflates my milk shoots into the back of the flange.

"My son just turned 2. He's been an avid nurser since birth and has always nursed to sleep: naps and bedtime. I recently started a part-time job and he's not stopped nursing, but he hardly ever wants to. That being said, I can't get him to go down for a nap by nursing any more.

"So after a year of only condoms, I'm in a monogamous relationship and finally got the push I needed to get an IUD. Due to scheduling I ended up getting it about a week (Jan 25) after my period ended (Jan 17), so almost around ovulation. Insertion was fine, a little crampy for the evening, a few days of spotting and no issues since. Because of the timing, doctor recommended 2 weeks of condoms. \n\nI had some mild cramps on Feb 6 and figured it was my period coming. I was due for my period around Feb 8 and nothing. No spotting or anything. I took two tests and both negative. \n\nSo now I'm just waiting impatiently expecting a blood bath at any time. My discharge is more watery, which is more consistent with around ovulation for me. I know with Mirena periods get lighter or might go away entirely but this seems very quick.

In such simple writing and simple stories, writers manage to summarise huge lifetime themes and ideas in a way which is so accessible, so perfectly written.\n\nChildren's books are beautiful - they draw you right back to moralistic basics and enable a better foundation for the understanding of the moral ambiguities of 'adult literature'; I feel like a lot more people should pay attention to the value of them.\n\nJust my thoughts :)",0,

We just came home from the NICU after a 12 day stay there and before we left me and SO got handed a leaflet about what to expect when we take our preemie home. The only thing is that every advise in there is linked with a certain weight, e.g. ""When your baby has reached 3-3,5 kg it is safe for it to go outside."" or ""When your baby has reached aprox 3 kg it can begin to sleep un-interrupted throughout the night."".\n\nThis obviously doesn't apply to us because we have to wake up during the night and wake him because he still hasn't started to complain when he's hungry.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is; do you guys have any advice for me, regarding stuff like: going outside, looking at things, staying awake for x amount of time, sleep time e.t.c.",1,child health

"A little back story: my son is 20 weeks old. I have trouble producing enough milk for him so he gets 8-12 ounces of formula a day. \n\nA few days ago, one of my friends was generous enough to give me a double medela pump so I can start working on increasing my supply. Problem is, I can't double pump because my right breast refuses to spit any milk out without me practically ripping it off with breast compressions. I know that this side is my bad producer, but it does get engorged and leak, I know it is producing milk. I will pump, I'll feel a letdown but only get drops while I stay full of milk. If I squeeze the crap out of it, I can get between .25-.5 ounce from it. \n\nAny advice on getting that side to react better to a pump so I can work more on increasing my supply? It does the same thing no matter what size flange I use. ",1,breastfeeding

My plan is to give breastfeeding a real chance and then switch to formula at 8 weeks.\n\nHow much do you spend a month? We don't have a Costco membership, but we're open to getting one.

Thankfully she listened to me and ran away. But it got me to wondering, if she hadn't listened to me, what would be the ""right way"" to go about stopping her?",1,child behavior problem

"All I can say is that it had to have been published before 1988 as that was when it was read at school. It was most likely published in the 1960s (but not definitely) based on just the general feel of the book.\n\nIt had black &amp; white illustrations and the characters were little totem heads or maybe tiki masks.

"My 8wo is incredibly sensitive to dairy, so I've gone off it just recently. Unfortunately I have about 75oz of frozen breast milk that I can't use right now because I pumped it while I was still eating dairy (he vomits and gets terrible reflux from it). So I've started pumping as much as possible for the remainder of my maternity leave (another 4.5 weeks), so I can have a stash stored for when I return to work. I'm going to continue pumping at work but I'm worried it won't be enough to provide for him while he's in childcare, since I hear your milk supply decreases significantly if you don't BF as often. We did try him on a soy based formula in case we need to supplement, but he threw that up as well and was constipated for almost 24 hours. So unfortunately it seems that dairy and soy based formulas aren't an option right now. Has anyone heard of another option for formula?

"Okay, so I am only using a hand pump, my baby is EBF with a bottle here and there so mommy can go on a date with daddy etc. I used up my small freezer stash and am trying build up more. \n\nThe first time I pumped after having not done it in a while I got nearly 3 ounces out of each breast. Now I'm lucky to get 2 out of both combined. I don't even pump up the pressure on the hand pump because then I get nothing. I literally just put the pump on and go because that seems to get the best results. My nipples are super sore and and I'm not pumping anything hardly. \n\nI think my flanges might be too big. It may be part of the issue, but I also don't understand how I can get less milk the more often I pump. And I usually pump late at night/early morning because of the greater production during that time. If I pump in the afternoon or evening I barely get half an ounce out of both even when engorged.\n\nHelp!\n\nEDIT: Spelling. I can do it.",1,breastfeeding

"Hi,\nI'm hoping for some feedback or insight about mid-cycle bleeding that I've been having. I had miscarriage in June that ended up lasting about three months because of retained products (more info. in my post history). I'm now on my fourth cycle since then and they are increasingly becoming more like they used to be. One thing that has been consisently different is spotting around 7-8 dpo, in each cycle. It is super light and lasts a day or two at most. Then it stops and I don't bleed again until my period or do the day before. I know that my cycles might be different or take awhile to regulate given my experience but I still worry about. Does anyone have insight or a similar experience? My ob-gyn doesn't seem concerned at all. I'm worried about low progesterone but since the bleeding stops completely again Im not sure if that makes sense. Any advice is appreciated!

My daughter is 18 months old and I am a SAHM so we've never been apart for more than a few hours. I am planning a trip where she will be with my parents for 4 days without me.

She's never napped without nursing though.)\n\nI think I'm ready to start the process regardless of this trip. She is very attached and clingy for me and im hoping this might help?

Plus it looks like the system includes tv time for a 1-yr-old.  \n\nHowever, when I watched it I definitely saw some similarities between what worked well for us and the system.  We didn't use a train whistle, but we did blow bubbles in the bathroom anytime he went in there to sit down (regardless of if he went or not) to make it fun/distracting.
