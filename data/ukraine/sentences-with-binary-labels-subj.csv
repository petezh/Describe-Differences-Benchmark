Red Cross admits Ukraine is in a state of civil war,0
It urges to respect international humanitarian law,0
The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Wednesday that Ukraine was in a state of civil war and called on the parties in conflict to respect international humanitarian law.,0
"“Fighting in eastern Ukraine continues to take its toll on civilians, and we urge all the sides to comply with international humanitarian law, otherwise known as the law of armed conflict,” ICRC director of operations Dominik Stillhart said.",0

"Prior to that, the Geneva-based humanitarian organization had refrained from giving the exact definition of a conflict that is under way in Ukraine.",0
"An internal armed conflict or a “non-international armed conflict”, according to the term used by the Red Cross, means that the country is being torn by a civil war.",0
"Though the Red Cross is not officially saying the term “civil war”, this is exactly how the conflict in Ukraine can be classified, the Red Cross said.",0
"“The ICRC reiterates that, under international humanitarian law, attacks may be directed only against military objectives and not against civilians, nor against civilian objects such as homes, schools, medical facilities and vehicles, community shelters or places of worship.",0
"International humanitarian law also stipulates respect and protection for the civilian population and those not (or no longer) participating in hostilities, such as the sick, the wounded and those who have been detained, who must be treated with dignity at all times,” Stillhart went on to say.",0
He arrived in Ukraine on Wednesday to discuss with the parties in conflict the ongoing repatriation of the bodies of those who died in the Boeing 777 crash over Ukraine’s Donetsk region on July 17.,0

"Crimea referendum illegal, no OSCE monitoring - Swiss",1
" VIENNA (Reuters) - Crimea's planned March 16 referendum on joining Russia is illegal in its current form and the OSCE will not send a mission to observe it, the Swiss head of Europe's security and democracy watchdog said on Monday.",1
Russia's RIA news agency said on Monday that Ukraine's Crimea region had invited the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to send a mission to observe Sunday's plebiscite,1
It said the invitation had been issued to the Vienna-based security and human rights organisation by the region's pro-Russian parliament.,0
"In its current form the referendum … is in contradiction with the Ukrainian constitution and must be considered illegal,"" Swiss Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter, whose country is the current chair of the Vienna-based OSCE, said in a statement.",1
"For any referendum regarding the degree of autonomy or sovereignty of the Crimea to be legitimate, it would need to be based on the Ukrainian constitution and would have to be in line with international law.",1
"He also ""ruled out the possibility of an OSCE observation of the planned referendum...as the basic criteria for a decision in a constitutional framework were not met,"" the statement added.",1
An OSCE spokeswoman said earlier that Crimea could not invite referendum observers as the region was not a full-fledged state and therefore not a member of the 57-member organisation.,1
"For the past week, OSCE military observers have been unable to enter Crimea, which has come under control of Russian forces since the fall of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich to months of popular unrest.",1
Russia Sinks Ship to Block Ukrainian Navy Ships,0
"The Russian Navy Ochakov Kara-class cruiser was sunk last night to block the Ukrainian Navy ships deployed in Novoozerne, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said in a press release today.",0
The information was confirmed by the Ukrainian military of the South Naval Base who were observing the operation.,0
The RF ships blocking the Ukrainian ships in Donuzlav lake in the Crimea left the zone at 23.30 p.m. (March 5).,0

"Therefore, the ships cannot leave the Donuzlav lake.",0
"It is needed a lot of time and costs to refloat this ship, according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense",0
"Ochakov was stationed in the Russian Black Sea Fleet as of 2011, however it has not been operational since the early 2000.",0

"As the rest of Europe prepares to set their clocks one hour forward for summer tomorrow, residents of Crimea braced for a two hour jump into the timezone of their new masters in Moscow.",0

"The Black Sea peninsula's prime minister Sergei Aksyonov will oversee the switch at 10pm (midnight Moscow, 2000 GMT).",0

"It is a little bit difficult,"" she said.",1
"But people are in high spirits and they are very happy."" Moscow in 2011 chose to stay on permanent Summer Time, which is four hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).",1
Earlier this month a majority of residents on the peninsula voted to break away from Ukraine and join Russia.,0
"The move came after Moscow sent troops to Crimea, claiming it needed to protect Russian speakers following a pro-European uprising in Kiev last month.",0
The West and Ukraine have condemned Moscow's takeover of the peninsula but Russian strongman Vladimir Putin hailed it as historic justice.,0
He has said Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's decision to give Crimea to the republic of Soviet Ukraine in 1954 was a mistake.,1
Ukrainian opposition uses polls to bolster cause,0
"The main reason Ukrainians massed in Kyiv’s Independence Square, was the violent police dispersal of a peaceful pro-EU demo and brutal beatings",0

"We usually join the demo at Independence Square in the evening, when we have time,” said one man with a pushchair.",0
The violent police attack was unprecedented.,0
None had taken place during the Orange Revolution itself.,0
"Instead of breaking the protesters’ will, it seems to have strengthened it.",0
“Seventy three percent of protesters said they’re going to stay there as long as needed until their demands are fulfilled.,0
"Only nine percent answered they’re going to hold a protest only for 2-3 days, while three percent of the participants said they would stay at the square until New Year Eve,” says Ilchuk.",0
"People power is also getting organised, with crowd numbers kept constant by rotation, and armies of volunteers organising supplies to fight the cold and hunger.",0

Death squads' in Ukraine says leader of one opposition party,0
The hospital where activist Dmytro Bulatov is recovering from his injuries has become the latest focus of the unrest in Kyiv.,0
At the capital’s airport the leader of one of the opposition parties – on his way to the security conference in Munich believes Bulatov’s alleged abduction is evidence of death squads.,0
"“We will insist in Munich on starting an international investigation into all the facts of murders, abuse, torture, kidnapping of people and those incidents where journalists were targeted and shot at.",0

"The Foreign Ministers of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia were shocked by the news that clashes between protesters and riot police resulted in casualties in Kyiv.",0

Ukraine has been witnessing a permanent and deepening internal political crisis for the past two months.,0
"As neighbours of Ukraine, V4 countries voice their strong concern with the fast escalation of the conflict and express their deepest condolences to the relatives of the victims.",0
Violence never contributed to resolving political crises and it can only aggravate the already complicated and dangerous situation.,0

Nuland: At least 400-500 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine,0
Nuland said Moscow continues to deny its military presence in the Donbas.,0
"The hearing, entitled ""U.S. policy in Ukraine: Russian opposition and stimulating reforms,"" was held in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the upper house of the U.S. Congress.",0
Evidence is mounting of heavy Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine since the beginning of the armed stage of the unrest there in April.,0
"Igor Girkin, the Russian former “defense minister” of the Donetsk People’s Republic militant organization, claimed in an interview in November that he and his team of Russian special operations soldiers “pulled the trigger of war” in the Donbas by carrying out the occupation of Ukrainian security offices in Donetsk region.",0
"Several videos exist of what may be Girkin’s team actually carrying out the military-style seizures of police and security service headquarters, with armed men in unmarked uniforms storming buildings, which were then occupied by local militants.",0
Then in late August Ukraine’s military advances against the militants in the east were brought to a sharp halt after what Kyiv and NATO say was a large incursion by regular Russian military units.,0
"Shortly after, Ukraine and the militants agreed on a ceasefire, although this was never respected by the militants, who advanced to take back ground they had lost earlier and even expanded the area they controlled.",0
"Ukrainian soldiers also say that it was largely regular Russian troops who attacked and captured the key strategic town of Debaltseve in Donetsk region, again in breach of the latest February 15 ceasefire – a claim corroborated by interviews published in the Russian media with Russian soldiers who said they participated in the battle.",0
"Although Russia denies sending its troops into Ukraine, the Kremlin made similar denials when it used its troops to take over the Ukrainian territory of Crimea last March.",0
"Russian President Vladimir Putin later admitted that Russian troops had been involved, and awarded some of them medals for taking part in the takeover operation.",0
Putin has since also admitted that planning for the Russian takeover of Crimea started even before former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had left Ukraine.,0
" Meanwhile, representative of the U.S. Treasury Department Ramin Toloui said that in the last few months alone the international community had decided to increase support to Ukraine and to allocate an additional $10 billion to support its economy in light of ongoing Russian aggression.",0
"In the second half of this year, the United States will provide the Ukrainian government an additional loan of $1 billion,"" Toloui said.",0
"Moscow is not rushing to demand from Ukraine the return of the loan of $3 billion provided to Kyiv in the last weeks of the regime of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia,"" Toloui said.",0
"Negotiations on the format of the return of these funds are being conducted with the IMF,"" he said.",0

Someone Sent a Mysterious Mass Text to Protesters in Kiev,0
The Ukraine government reportedly sent protesters in Kiev a creepy text message.,0
This is how they could have done it.,0
"As mass riots continued on the streets of Kiev, protesters, as well as other people in the area, received a mysterious text message on Monday evening.",0
"Dear subscriber, you are registered as a participant in a mass disturbance,"" the message read, as first reported by The New York Times .",0
"The text came from a number only identified as 111, but the Times suggests Ukrainian authorities were behind it.",0
"The country's Interior Ministry, however, denied sending the messages, as later reported by The Guardian .",0
"But regardless of who was responsible for the SMS messages, how did they do it?",0
How did they pinpoint only certain cellphones in a specific area?,0
"It turns out, something like this wouldn't be that hard to carry out.",0
"It is very easy to send messages out to everybody who was in one particular area, at one particular time,"" said Eva Galperin, an activist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and an expert in surveillance technology.",0
"There are a few different ways the Ukrainian government could have done it, according to Ashkan Soltani, an independent privacy researcher.",0
"The easiest would have been for the government to ask Ukrainian cellphone providers to give them a list of numbers that were connected to a certain cellphone tower, or a few towers, in a certain interval of time.",0
"This is what is commonly referred to as "" tower dumps .",0
"This would imply the collaboration of the cellphone companies, but all the major Ukrainian providers on Tuesday denied they had anything to do with this incident.",0
"We declare our innocence,"" wrote MTS on its Facebook page according to a translation of the statement.",0
It was carried out by using equipment that does not belong to MTS.,0
"Another provider, Kyivstar, penned a similar denial.",0
Attackers are using illegal equipment for such mailings.,0
"We know of the existence of equipment (the so-called 'pirate base stations') that allows you to send SMS and make calls to mobile phones subscribers to any operators that are in a certain area,"" the company wrote on Facebook.",0
"Here's the catch: The equipment to which they refer actually exists, and with it authorities wouldn't need the providers' help to identify whoever was in downtown Kiev near the protests and send them the text messages.",0
"The easiest way would be to use a so-called ""IMSI catcher,"" which is a portable device built to act as a cell tower and trick nearby cellphones into connecting to it, Soltani explained to Mashable .",0
"They're essentially fake base stations,"" Soltani told Mashable .",0
"Once a cellphone is connected to one of these International Mobile Subscriber Number (IMSI) catchers, the device captures a deluge of information, including identifying details such as the IMSI and the Electronic Serial Number (ESM).",0
"Once the IMSI catcher is connected to a series of cellphones, it can broadcast text messages like the one the protesters received.",0
"Devices like these are normally employed by police departments to track suspected criminals, but their use has stirred controversy because they don't discriminate.",0
"Any cellphone in their range gets caught in their surveillance net, and these devices are also designed to intercept phone calls and messages.",0
"There are a lot of commercial IMSI catchers , costing anywhere from $20,000 to around $140,000, depending on their features and range.",0
"They are sometimes referred to as ""Stingrays,"" from the most widely known of this devices, made by Harris Corporation .",0
"But hackers have been able to build similar machines with just $1,500.",0
"According to Costin Raiu, a security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, this is the most likely theory, assuming the cellphone providers did not cooperate.",0
"While it's still unclear who sent these messages in Kiev, it's clear why they did it.",0
"You can scare people into thinking that they have been targeted much more narrowly by writing a message that implies essentially 'we caught you personally rioting,'"" said Galperin.",0
"The protesters, however, were not scared away, as clashes continued after the message was broadcast.",0
"Ukraine Passes Law On Russia Sanctions, Gas Pipelines",0
Ukraine's parliament has passed legislation that would allow the government to impose sanctions on Russia.,0
The bill was approved in a final reading on August 14.,0
"It provides for sanctions against 172 individuals and 65 entities in Russia and other countries for supporting and financing ""terrorism"" in Ukraine, though actual sanctions would need approval from Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.",0
A total of 244 lawmakers in the Verkhovna Rada supported the sanctions.,0
Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told parliament after the August 14 vote that Ukraine had taken a historic step.,0
"By approving the law on sanctions, we showed that the country is able to protect itself,"" he said.",0
"The law should give a clear answer to any aggressor or terrorist who threatens our national security, our government, and our citizens.",0
The names of those Russian individuals and companies targeted by the sanctions will not be published until President Petro Poroshenko has signed the law into force.,0
"Naftohaz, Ukraine's state-run energy firm, said in a statement on August 13 that future sanctions against Russia would not necessarily target Russia's gas giant Gazprom, however.",0
"The adoption of the sanctions law will not lead automatically to sanctions against any entity, including Gazprom.",0
"The law simply establishes the legal right to implement them,"" the statement said.",0
A version of the bill passed on first reading on August 12 had included provisions allowing the censoring of media deemed a national security threat.,0
"Those provisions were removed from the final version of the bill, however.",0
"Rights groups had said the law would give the council ""draconian"" powers to restrict media and could return a nation once celebrated for media freedoms to Soviet-era levels of censorship.",0
"In a statement, the representative on media freedom for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Dunja Mijatovic, welcomed the move to drop the media provisions as a ""step in the right direction.",0
"The provisions could potentially endanger free media and pluralism in Ukraine,"" she said, ""and by dropping them the legislators have taken a decision to protect and ensure free media and freedom of expression, rather than restricting free speech.",0
"Also on August 14, Ukraine's parliament approved a bill to allow gas-transit facilities to be leased on a joint-venture basis with participation from EU and U.S. firms.",0
The measure says Ukraine will hold 51 percent and foreign partners will be offered 49 percent in the venture.,0
It covers both transit pipelines and underground gas-storage facilities.,0
The law passed by 228 votes -- two more than the minimum necessary.,0
Ukraine is making efforts to become less dependent on Russian gas after suffering three cutoffs of natural-gas supplies from Russia in less than nine years.,0
"At the same time, Kyiv wants to provide more reliable transit for Russian gas to the EU market.",0
"Kyiv says the measure will bring in investment and remove the need for the South Stream pipeline, which Russia is building to take gas to southeastern Europe across the Black Sea, bypassing Ukraine.",0
OSCE team says Crimea gunmen threatened to shoot at them,0
Moscow which denies its troops have a role in the takeover of Crimea says people there - a small majority of whom are ethnic Russians - should have the right,0
"Gunmen manning a roadblock in Crimea last week threatened to open fire at an unarmed OSCE observer team if it tried to enter the southern Ukrainian region, now controlled by pro- Russia n forces, a report on the failed mission said.",0
"The mission report, obtained by Reuters, gave new detail on how more than 40 military observers from about two dozen member states of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OCSE) were prevented from getting to Crimea.",0
"Despite repeated attempts to enter the Crimean peninsula… (the monitors were) consistently refused access at gunpoint and therefore were not able to dispel concerns over the reported unusual Russian Federation military activity,"" it said.",0
"However, their observations still ""produced significant evidence of equipment consistent with the presence of Russian Federation military personnel in the vicinity of the various roadblocks encountered"" during the March 5-8 period.",0
"Citing the report, the United States said in a separate statement that the Russian military appeared to have been involved with the armed groups who set up road blocks and blocked the OSCE observers from crossing into Crimea last week.",0
"Pro-Russian forces have taken over military installations across Crimea, home to the Russian Black Sea Fleet.",0
"When the OSCE team tried to get into Crimea on Saturday, warning shots were fired and it was turned back.",0
It was the last - and the most dramatic - of several failed attempts by the observers to enter Crimea to try to find out more of what was happening there.,0
"The report provided a blow-by-blow account of the March 8 incident as the team attempted to reach the Crimean port town of Sebastopol but were stopped at a roadblock with ""a mixture of uniformed and unidentified armed personnel"".",0
"Numerous roadblock personnel were observed with safety catches off,"" it said.",0
"Less than five minutes after arrival, as the team moved forward to the roadblock, a three-round burst of automatic fire was discharged within the roadblock area.",0
"U.S. SEES ""DIRECT INVOLVEMENT"" BY RUSSIA",0
"The OSCE monitors were told there were no orders from higher authorities to allow passage amid ""alleged concerns over the influence of external actors"" on the March 16 referendum in Crimea on whether to join Russia, the report said.",0
"While in the vicinity of the roadbloack, SALW (Small Arms and Light Weapons) were ""held in the aim towards"" the OSCE team.",0
"The team were forcefully advised by the roadblock personnel that further approaches would be met with direct fire,"" it said.",0
"A UAZ 469 vehicle with license plate numbers associated with the Black Sea Fleet were seen at the site, the report said.",0
"At an earlier attempt to enter Crimea, more than 50 soldiers wearing ""RU pattern uniforms and combat equipment without identifying patches"" were observed.",0
"The U.S. ambassador to the OSCE, Daniel Baer, said in the U.S. statement: ""This report adds to our deep concerns and clearly suggests direct involvement by the Russian federation and its agents in preventing impartial, unarmed observers from doing the work they are supposed to do.",0
"Moscow, which denies its troops have a role in the takeover of Crimea, says people there - a small majority of whom are ethnic Russians - should have the right to secede.",0

PUTIN TALKS,0
"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday discussed the crisis in Ukraine with Swiss Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter , whose country chairs the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Kremlin said.",0
"Putin and Burkhalter ""discussed the capabilities of the OSCE in the context of fostering a resolution of the crisis"", the Kremlin statement said.",0
It gave no details and said nothing about any agreement.,0
"An OSCE statement later said the men had ""talked about possible ways to overcome the current crisis"" and focused on ""potential modalities"" for the creation of an international contact group on Ukraine .",0
"Burkhalter also ""stressed the importance of an early consensus"" on the deployment of an OSCE monitoring mission to Ukraine , to contribute to an improved security situation, including for minorities, the OSCE statement said.",0
Talk of a mediation role for the OSCE has come to little.,0
"Burkhalter said on Tuesday the group would not send a mission to monitor a referendum in Crimea on Sunday over whether the Ukrainian region should join Russia , warning the plebiscite would be illegal.",0

"EU leaders will only want to discuss the Netherlands' rejection of the EU-Ukraine treaty after the UK in-out referendum, says Dutch PM Rutte.",0
61 percent of Dutch voters that showed up at the referendum rejected the EU-Ukraine treaty (Photo: Peter Teffer),0
"Rutte's centre-right Liberals and centre-left Labour have a slim majority in the parliament's Lower House, where the entire opposition has demanded the ratification law be withdrawn following the referendum in which 61 percent of voters rejected the treaty.",0
“The people have spoken.,0
The people were clear.,0
"The people said No,” said anti-EU opposition MP Geert Wilders during a Lower House debate Wednesday evening.",0
"But PM Rutte asked the parliament for a chance to first try to find a solution by having discussions with the 27 other EU member states, who did ratify the treaty and with Ukraine.",0
He said withdrawing the ratification law would undermine those talks.,0
"“We would lose our entry ticket to those talks, that is the paradox we are dealing with,” said Rutte, adding that in that case “no-one” would want to talk to the Dutch government.",0
"He added that a conclusion to those talks would not be reached before 23 June, when the UK will have its referendum on whether to remain or leave the bloc.",0
"“Our political estimation, based on the first signals we received from our European partners, is that they want that [the UK referendum] out of the way first,” said Rutte.",0
"“That doesn't mean that nothing can happen behind closed doors,” he said, but adding that only a public debate in Brussels about the Dutch referendum could lead to political conclusions.",0
Rutte said he was aiming at such a resolution “before the summer”.,0
No means No,0
"His government was criticised by the entire opposition for not immediately pulling the plug on ratification, including by political parties who had campaigned in favour of the agreement.",0
"“Real people went to real polling stations to really say No,” said MP Sybrand Buma, of the centre-right Christian Democrats.",0
"“I find it dramatic, but we can't say in hindsight: 'it's disappointing, we are going to do what we want.'”",0
"His left-wing Green colleague Rik Grashoff added: “I don't envy the prime minister, but he is going to have to negotiate in Brussels with the position that the Netherlands has withdrawn its support for the treaty.”",0
Eurosceptic opposition MP Marianne Thieme said Rutte is trying to fool No voters that some renegotiation of the treaty is what they wanted.,0
“The citizen should be taken seriously.,0
"In this debate, the prime minister is feeding the public distrust in politics,” she said.",0
"In a way, the Dutch political establishment created the mess for itself.",0
"Before the referendum, all main parties said they would follow the advice no matter what the result.",0
"So although the vote was formally non-binding, the politicians framed it in such a way that the result could not be ignored.",0

"A day after Ukraine gave the go-ahead to sign agreements with the EU at a November summit in Lithuania, Putin made clear Moscow would hit back if its market were flooded by competitive goods from the EU because of Kiev removing import duties.",0
"“We would somehow have to stand by our market, introduce protectionist measures.",0
"We are saying this openly in advance,” Putin told a gathering of Russia experts and journalists.",0
He gave no details but said: “We will need to consider how many goods access our market and what protective measures we will have to take.”,0
"Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev also criticized the former Soviet republic’s “crafty” decision to chart a course away from its traditional close economic relationship with Russia, which is still Kiev’s biggest single trading partner.",0
"Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said on Wednesday that the planned agreements with the EU raised the prospect of “a European quality of life” for his former Soviet republic, squeezed between Russia and the EU.",0
"But Azarov said nothing about the imprisonment of his predecessor, Yulia Tymoshenko, whose release European envoys have been trying to secure in the run-up to the meeting in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.",0
"The 28-member EU has condemned her trial for abuse-of-office and seven-year jail sentence as politically motivated, and her continued confinement threatens prospects of signing agreements that include the one on free trade.",0
"Russia’s pressure has injected new tension into Moscow’s relationship with Ukraine, which has pleaded unsuccessfully for cheaper Russian gas to help its hard-pressed economy.",0
"Azarov on Wednesday spelled out the trade advantages for Ukraine, whose economy is dominated by exports such as steel, chemicals and agricultural produce.",0
He promised there would be softer duties on Ukrainian exports almost immediately.,0
"But Putin said Ukraine had more to gain from joining the Customs Union grouping Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus, saying they could join forces to press the EU for better trade conditions.",0
“What is the advantage of Ukraine signing the EU association agreement and opening up its markets? ,0
"Yes, this will make its economy more liberal.",0
"But will the Ukrainian economy itself be able to cope with this liberalism? I don’t know,” he said.",0
The pressure from Moscow forms part of a broader drive by Russia to deter former Soviet allies from edging out of its orbit and moving their economy and future trade towards the EU.,0

"MARIUPOL, Ukraine— Fierce fighting between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russia protesters Friday in Mariupol killed seven people, turned police headquarters into a smoldering ruin and left the city center blocked off after residents built barricades of tires.",0
The violence in this strategic port city on the Azov Sea — along the main road between the Russian border and the Crimean Peninsula — was a clear sign of increasing unrest in eastern Ukraine.,0
"The Donetsk region, which includes Mariupol, and the neighboring Luhansk region are to hold a hastily organized referendum Sunday on declaring sovereignty, a move likely to deepen the crisis between supporters of Ukraine’s fledgling government and pro-Russia insurgents who claim the authorities in Kiev are a fascist junta.",0
"There were varying accounts of Friday’s violence in Mariupol, a city of a half-million people that also was hit by unrest last month.",0
Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said about 60 gunmen attacked the police station and were repulsed in an operation that killed one policeman and about 20 people that he called “terrorists.”,0
"The Donetsk regional government said that as of 8 p.m., seven people were killed and 39 others were wounded in the violence that came on the day that commemorates the 69th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany.",0
The conflicting death tolls could not be reconciled.,0
An Associated Press reporter saw three bodies on the street — one of them covered by a blanket with a policeman’s hat placed at the head.,0
"As the police station burned, residents gave accounts of the day’s events that contradicted the official line.",0
Some said government troops fired on unarmed protesters and attacked police who were protecting demonstrators occupying the nearby administration headquarters.,0
Amateur video on the Internet showed soldiers firing warning shots and later wounding men who angrily confronted them.,0
"At least one man in civilian clothes could be seen shooting in the direction of the soldiers, who backed away on foot.",0
"Larissa Gremacheva, a retiree, said soldiers fired on unarmed men.",0

Government troops appeared to have lost an armored personnel carrier to attacking mobs.,0

What does the West want from Ukraine?,0
Experts say there's motivation beyond altruism for the US and EU trying to forge closer ties with the country in crisis,1
"As the crisis in Ukraine  drags on into its fourth month, the geopolitics of the situation have grown increasingly complex, with more diplomats, leaders and interested parties opining on each and every development in the country.",0
"President Barack Obama and leaders from the European Union, for example, have spoken at length on what they want for Ukraine — that it determine its own destiny, and not just any destiny, but one that is different from its past of playing economic lapdog to Russia.",0
"Going beyond the platitudes of supporting Ukraine's autonomy, however, what has gone without much discussion is why the cash-strapped European Union and the U.S. were motivated to step into the fray — to potentially spend billions of dollars on a country that without the support of Russia might face economic collapse.",0
"With tension from military posturing in Crimea increasing, and the potential for bloodshed potent, foreign policy watchers say it’s important to suss out soon why exactly the EU and U.S. — which have been focused inwardly on domestic issues since the global financial crisis — now seem so intent on helping determine the direction of Ukraine.",0
"Besides pure altruism, they say the countries have a lot to lose if Ukraine falls further into crisis, and perhaps just as much to gain if it doesn’t.",1
"“This is a big country in the center of Europe that can affect the stability of all of Europe,” said William Taylor, vice president at the  U.S. Institute for Peace.",0
"“A civil war there would affect energy supplies, trade, everything.”",1
"Taylor and others believe all of the West, especially the EU, have a vested economic interested in making sure Ukraine stays stable.",0
"For one, the EU exports over $20 billion in goods — primarily machinery, vehicles and industrial chemicals — to  Ukraine annually .",0
"Ukraine is also one of the world’s largest growers of corn and wheat, and exports it to EU countries and elsewhere.",0
"Analysts believe that with heavy investment, Ukraine’s agricultural sector could grow exponentially. ",0
"Beyond maintaining the current flow of trade, if Ukraine shuns Russia, experts believe EU countries will be able to benefit from increased trade with Ukraine.",0
That’s why EU officials are attempting to sign a  free-trade agreement with Ukraine  even as the crisis escalates.,0
And some say the country may even be able to eventually join the European Union.,1
"But more important than crops and cars — for Ukraine, the EU and U.S. — is gas.",0
"Experts say the EU and U.S. could profit economically if Ukraine begins to rely less on Gazprom, Russia’s quasi-governmental oil and gas giant. ",0
They point out that the protests in Ukraine started partially because of Ukraine’s  near-complete reliance on Russian gas.,0
And Ukraine has been trying to break away from that dependence for years.,1
"In November, it signed a $10 billion deal with Chevron to produce natural gas within Ukraine, but it could also look elsewhere for its supplies.",0
"As the EU and U.S. discover new ways to extract oil and gas on their own soil — namely through hydraulic fracturing — and build liquefied natural-gas terminals to send it around the world, Ukraine could become a viable market.",0
"“The whole natural gas market is changing dramatically,” USIP’s Taylor said.",0
"“Over the next five years, there’s going to be dramatic changes in the flows of gas, and the leverage Russians have over the EU and Ukraine is going to decline.”  ",0
"Because Europe also relies heavily on Gazprom, disrupting Ukraine’s relations with Russia is a risky prospect.",0
"Some believe it’s no coincidence that the countries that rely most on Russia for gas, especially Germany,  have been more reluctant  than the U.S. to suggest sanctions against Russia.",0
The EU may be seeking a middle ground — making sure the gas can keep flowing while Ukraine also builds closer ties with European countries.,0
"At least for the U.S., isolating Gazprom might not be as controversial of an option.",1
"In the midst of a hydraulic fracturing-created gas boom, the U.S. has been looking to increase gas exports dramatically over the next few years.",0
"So the possibility that Ukraine, and therefore the EU, might break away from Russia’s gas supply might be considered both a geopolitical win and cash bonanza by U.S. politicians.",1
"“The United States has abundant supplies of natural gas — an energy source that is in demand by many of our allies — and the U.S. Department of Energy’s excruciatingly slow approval process amounts to a de facto ban on American natural gas exports that Vladimir Putin has happily exploited to finance his geopolitical goals,” House Speaker John Boehner said Tuesday.",1
“We should not force our allies to remain dependent on Putin for their energy needs.,1
"Ending this de facto ban and expediting approval of natural gas exports is one clear step the U.S. can take to stand by our allies and stand up to Russian aggression, while creating American jobs at the same time.”",1
"Some analysts say breaking EU and Ukrainian reliance on Russia’s gas might not only be about the economy, but about something the U.S. has  wanted to do ever since the Cold War : prove it, and not Russia, is the world’s preeminent superpower.",1
"“The U.S. has never gotten over the Cold War, and (U.S.) leaders view Russia as a potential adversary,” said Michael Klare, a professor of peace and world security studies at Hampshire College.",0
“ (Russia is) a petro-state.,1
Take that away and Putin’s power disappears.”,1
"Visiting Russia, Fidel Castro's Son Scoffs at U.S. Sanctions Over Crimea",0
VORONEZH — The son of Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro declared that the island nation recognizes Crimea as a part of Russia and urged the Kremlin to follow Havana's example and stand firm in the face of international sanctions.,0
"Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, scientific adviser of the State Council of the Republic of Cuba and vice president of the Academy of Sciences of Cuba, made the remarks while accepting an honorary doctorate from his former university in Voronezh over the weekend.",0
"While Russia is under enormous international pressure for annexing Crimea from Ukraine last month, Castro Diaz-Balart reaffirmed that Cuba officially recognized the referendum results in Crimea that paved the way for President Vladimir Putin to sign the annexation agreement.",0
He also noted that Cuba joined 10 other countries in refusing to condemn the annexation during a vote of the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday.,0
"One hundred countries approved the resolution, while 58 countries abstained.",0
"During the UN vote, Cuba proved that it remains a friend of Russia and of other countries of the former Soviet Union forever,"" Castro Diaz-Balart said in the speech Saturday at Voronezh State University.",0
He insisted that Cuba was also a friend of Ukraine.,0
"The people of Ukraine, as I understand it, do not have any claims against the Russians,"" he said, following the Kremlin line.",0
It is those in power who are acting in their own self-interest.,0
Fidel Castro Díaz-Balart attending a ceremony where he received an honorary doctorate at Voronezh State University on Saturday.,0
"Castro Diaz-Balart scoffed at the steps that the U.S. and European Union have taken to isolate Russia, including the suspension of its membership in the Group of Eight and the placement of travel bans and asset freezes on people close to Putin.",0
"Cuba has extensive experience of living in isolation from the U.S.,"" Castro Diaz-Balart said.",0
"The Voronezh visit was something of a homecoming for Castro Diaz-Balart, the eldest son of Castro from his first wife.",0
"He enrolled at the university as a physical education student in 1968 and changed his major to nuclear physics two years later, acting under the influence of the university's nuclear physicists.",0
He went on to graduate with honors from Moscow State University.,0
Castro Diaz-Balart then worked at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research in Dubna before earning his first doctorate in 1978.,0
"In 1999, he received a second doctorate, this time from the Kurchatov Institute of Nuclear Energy, and he also holds honorary doctorates from Moscow State University and Rostov State University.",0
"On Saturday, the Voronezh university gave Diaz-Balart his third honorary doctorate from Russia and an award titled ""For Merit to Voronezh State University"" at a ceremony attended by Voronezh Governor Alexei Gordeyev.",0
"After referring to Crimea and the uprising in Ukraine, Diaz-Balart finished his speech with a quote from his father: ""When all great revolutions come to an end, there will only be one left — the great revolution of science and knowledge.",0
And it will never finish.,0
Ukraine crisis: Seventeen killed in clashes with pro-Russian separatists near Donetsk,0
"Seventeen Ukrainian soldiers were killed in clashes with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, three days before a presidential election in the former Soviet republic.",0
"At least 17 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in clashes with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, just three days before a presidential election in the former Soviet republic.",0
"Ukraine's health ministry said 16 troops died in a firefight in the town of Volnovakha in the Donetsk region, in addition to one soldier killed in another attack in the neighbouring region of Luhansk.",0
"Video posted on YouTube showed men in Ukrainian uniforms taking cover in a field said to be in Volnovakha, as vehicles burned nearby, explosions were heard in the distance, and attack helicopters flew low overhead.",0
"The attack happened about 20 kilometres south of the industrial hub of Donetsk, which is now in the hands of separatists who say they will disrupt the election.",0
"In Luhansk Ukrainian border guards said they had fought off an attempt by dozens of separatists, armed with grenade launchers and rifles, to enter the region from Russia.",0
"The clashes came as Russia moved 15 transport planes and 20 trains carrying personnel and military equipment out of three provinces that border Ukraine, according to the defence ministry.",0
"The moving of units is continuing,"" Russia's Interfax news agency quoted a defence ministry statement as saying, adding that the troops were returning to their permanent bases after conducting military exercises in the border provinces.",0
"NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the Russian troop movements ""may suggest"" preparations for a withdrawal.",0
"Ukrainian security forces and the pro-Moscow separatists have clashed repeatedly in recent weeks in eastern Ukraine, where the breakdown of security has rattled the pro-Western interim government in Kiev.",0
"Kiev has acknowledged that Sunday's election cannot be held in parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and has accused Moscow of deliberately seeking to undermine Ukrainian democracy, a charge echoed by the United States and European Union.",0
"Russia denies the legitimacy of the current Kiev government, which took over after mass street protests toppled Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovych in February.",0
He fled to Russia and in March Russia annexed Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea.,0
President Vladimir Putin asserts that Moscow has the right to intervene on behalf of Russian speakers outside Russia's borders and has expressed sympathy for people in eastern Ukraine who he says face discrimination and harassment by the Kiev government.,0
Meanwhile a diplomatic row unfolded between Russia and the UK after Prince Charles apparently compared Mr Putin's actions to those of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.,1
"During a trip to Canada, the 65-year-old prince told a Jewish woman who fled from Poland during World War II that in Ukraine ""Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler"", according to the Daily Mail newspaper.",1
"Charles's remarks, described by a royal source as ""well-intentioned"" and not meant to be made public, caused a stir in Britain because the royal family is not expected to voice political views in public.",0
"If these words were truly spoken, then, without doubt, they do not reflect well on the future British monarch,"" a spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry told a news conference.",0
"We view the use of the Western press by members of the British royal family to spread the propaganda campaign against Russia on a pressing issue - that is, the situation in Ukraine - as unacceptable, outrageous and low.",0
Russian flags flood Crimean capital as thousands back takeover by Russia,0
"SIMFEROPOL, Ukraine (AFP) - Russian flags flooded Lenin Square in the centre of Crimea's capital Simferopol on Sunday as thousands rallied in support of Moscow's takeover of the peninsula - vastly overwhelming a smaller pro-Ukraine demonstration nearby.",0
"The rival rallies in Simferopol were peaceful, in contrast to the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, where about 100 pro-Russians with clubs and whips attacked some 20 people who were guarding a pro-Ukraine rally.",0
"Some 10,000 people joined the pro-Russia rally in Simferopol, chanting ""Russia! Russia!"" as a navy band played patriotic Russian songs and dancers twirled on stage.",0
"We will overcome all adversity, all obstacles and we will restore historic justice,"" the newly installed pro-Russian Prime Minister of Crimea, Mr Sergei Aksyonov, told the crowd.",0
"Together with Russia we will build our future!"" he cried, prompting shouts of ""Hurrah! Hurrah!"" from the crowd.",0
"Standing amidst signs reading ""Crimea is not in Ukraine"" and ""With Russia, Peace in Crimea,"" 60-year-old Ms Olga said restoring Crimea to Russian rule would undo a historical injustice.",0
"We don't want to be with those Ukrainian fascists any more,"" said Ms Olga, who declined to give her surname.",0
"A few kilometres away, a much smaller crowd of about 1,000 gathered for a more sombre demonstration in support of Crimea remaining within Ukraine.",0
"Standing under a bronze bust of Mr Taras Shevchenko - the Ukrainian poet and national hero whose birth 200 years earlier was marked on Sunday - the demonstrators read poetry and sang the national anthem, many with their hands on their hearts.",0
"We are here to honour the great Shevchenko and Ukraine,"" said Mr Svyatoslav Regushevsky, a 46-year-old who brought his 21/2-year-old son, wearing a ski jacket with the Ukrainian flag colours, to the unity rally.",0
"They cannot seize Crimea, (it's an) illegal occupation,"" he said, as around him unity supporters waved yellow-and-blue balloons marked: ""We are for peace in Ukraine"".",0
"The atmosphere was peaceful, with several dozen police keeping watch on the edges of the crowd.",0
"A convoy of about 30 cars tooting their horns and waving Russian flags drove by the rally, prompting shouts of ""Shame! Shame!"" from participants.",0
"Asked why so many more people were at the pro-Russia rally, 32-year-old Mr Anton Vlasenko said they were afraid to stand up to Moscow.",0
"They are scared of the Russian soldiers, they think they have no choice,"" he said.",0
He said the referendum planned for March 16 on making Crimea part of Russia - announced after pro-Moscow lawmakers seized control and Russian forces flooded into the region - was a farce.,0
"The Kalashnikov is the symbol of Russian democracy,"" Mr Vlasenko said.",0
"Attempts to hold a similar pro-unity demonstration in Sevastopol were met with violence, with the pro-Russian activists attacking some 20 people who were guarding a 200-strong rally in an outer district of the city.",0
"The attackers destroyed a car and blocked the vehicles of the security men guarding the crowd, at least five of whom were detained by police.",0
"It was unclear whether anybody was seriously injured in the clashes at the rally, which also saw protesters waving the Ukrainian flag and singing the national anthem.",0
Ukraine right revives wartime symbols amid 'revolution',0
Major nationalist role in protests worries many in Ukraine and abroad,0
"As Ukraine’s opposition movement vows to continue its “revolution” with more protests and a general strike, an ultra- nationalist party is playing a leading role and former symbols of the far-right fringe are moving into the political mainstream.",0
"Flying above crowds in Kiev and other cities, the flags of Ukraine and the European Union mingle with red-and-black “blood and soil” nationalist banners.",0
"Across the country, the rallying cry of this revolt booms out countless times every day: “Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!”",0
"The flag and the mantra of the protests were first used by guerrillas in the 1940s, who fought against Nazi and Soviet occupiers in a bid to carve out an independent Ukraine.",0
"They are still lionised by many people in western regions, while people in southern and eastern Ukraine, with closer ties to Russia , deride them as Nazi collaborators.",0
"Historians say the guerrillas sometimes fought alongside Adolf Hitler’s forces in the hope of securing support for a sovereign Ukraine, and were involved in the killing of tens of thousands of Poles and the German-led mass murder and deportation of Jews.",0
"On New Year’s Day, about 15,000 people took part in a torchlit procession through Kiev to mark 105 years since the birth of wartime nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who is honoured with statues in western Ukraine but reviled in regions closer to Russia, as well as by Jews and Poles.",0
"“Glory to the nation, death to the enemies!” chanted the crowd, led by members of a nationalist party called Svoboda (“Freedom”), which has risen rapidly from relative obscurity to be the fourth-largest party in parliament and jointly runs councils in western Ukraine.",0
Liberal opposition parties distanced themselves from the march.,0
"Today’s “enemies” are president Viktor Yanukovich , whom critics accuse of leading Ukraine away from the European Union and back into Russia’s embrace.",0
Svoboda’s activists are now playing a major role in running Kiev’s main protest camp and buildings occupied by demonstrators.,0
They were also prominent in resisting riot police who tried to storm the camp and in the highly symbolic toppling of a statue of Vladimir Lenin.,0
"Svoboda’s leader, former surgeon Oleh Tyahnybok, rouses protesters with firebrand rhetoric attacking the “anti-Ukrainian” forces running the country, and he has met visiting senior EU and US diplomats who would have shunned him in other circumstances.",0
"Tyahnybok’s diatribes against corrupt politicians, tycoons and the Kremlin play well with the crowd, and the protests are helping him to push Svoboda towards Ukraine’s political centre.",0
"How Svoboda will emerge from Ukraine’s turmoil remains to be seen, but its growing influence, hostility towards Russia and praise for Bandera could deepen the country’s divisions.",0
"Svoboda also presents an easy target to the protesters’ foes: Ukraine’s premier Mykola Azarov has called them “Nazis and extremists”, while Russian president Vladimir Putin compared the rallies to a “pogrom”.",0
Statement of the MFA of the Republic of Bulgaria on the escalation of the situation in Ukraine,0
"Nickolay Mladenov: All agreed that a political solution to the problem in Afghanistan should be found, Deutsche Welle Radio, January 29, 2010  ...",0
"Host: In connection with the London Conference on Afghanistan, our London correspondent Andrei Vladov talked about the Bulgarian commitments at Hindukush with Nickolay Mladenov, the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign  Affairs and until quite recently  Minister of Defence, who is participating in the conference.",0
Nickolay Mladenov: Bulgaria is participating quite strongly in the international operation in Afghanistan.,0
"Our contingent at the moment is nearly 500-strong, with troops in Kabul and Kandahar and medical teams in Kabul and Herat.",0
"The government decided a while ago, early this year, to boost the size of our contingent in Kandahar with 30 people.",0
"This is something I reaffirmed in London, and a further 70 or so people will be sent by the year’s end because the international operation for stabilisation of Afghanistan requires that in addition to the United States boosting troop numbers by 30,000, the other countries should also contribute according to their capabilities.",0
"We saw, for example, that Romania doubled its military contingent in Afghanistan from 800 to 1,600.",0
And Germany doubled its financial assistance.,0
Andrei Vladov: Does that mean that at least for now Bulgaria is not considering phasing out of Afghanistan? N.Mladenov: The government has a mandate from the National Assembly until the completion of the international mission for stabilisation of Afghanistan.,0
Therefore all our efforts are concentrated within this mandate.,0
"In addition, Bulgaria will join the European Union Police Mission to help with the training of the Afghan police as part of the NATO security mission.",0
A.Vladov: And yet isn’t civilian presence lagging behind Bulgaria’s military presence? ,0
I am drawing a parallel with the situation in Iraq and the deep disappointment of the Bulgarian public that Bulgarian companies failed to win lucrative contracts for the  reconstruction of the country.,0
Do you think that Bulgaria has learned from this experience and can something be done to ensure that Bulgarian companies will participate in the construction of infrastructure in Afghanistan? ,0
N.Mladenov: You are absolutely right about Iraq.,0
"However, there is no comparing Iraq with Afghanistan at this point.",0
It will take quite some time for the situation in Afghanistan to make possible some form of more direct economic participation.,0
An interesting initiative was suggested today - that an economic forum be organised in Turkey for the entire region around Afghanistan to seek out such opportunities.,0
"However, it is still early days for this.",0
"Today’s main conclusion is that all agreed that yes, a political solution should be found to the problem in Afghanistan, but there must be some form of peace first.",0
"Host: This was Andrei Vladov talking with the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign  Affairs, Nickolay Mladenov.",0
Deep rifts emerge in ranks of Ukraine's pro-Russia insurgents as support from Moscow evaporates,0
"DONETSK, Ukraine — Deep strains emerged Thursday in the ranks of Ukraine’s pro-Moscow insurgents as dozens turned in their weapons in disgust at Russian inaction and bickering broke out between rebel factions.",0
"In the past two weeks, Ukrainian government troops have halved the amount of territory held by the rebels and have grown better equipped and more confident by the day.",0
"Once fearful of losing further pieces of Ukraine to Russia, they have shifted their strategy to containing the insurgents, whose pleas to join Russia have been ignored by President Vladimir Putin.",0
"Pushed back into Ukraine’s eastern industrial city of Donetsk, the pro-Russia militias appear to be focusing their efforts now on hit-and-run operations, bombing transportation links and bracing for more assaults from government forces.",0
"Signs of a rift within the rebellion became evident Thursday when the head of the influential Vostok battalion announced he would not submit to the authority of the military leader of the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic, Igor Girkin.",0
"Girkin, a Russian better known by his assumed name Strelkov, has attained hero status among supporters of the insurgency.",0
Ukrainian authorities have identified him as a former Russian military intelligence agent active in taking over Crimea before Russia annexed it in March.,0
"Yet he has also been criticized by some for leading the rebel withdrawal last weekend from the eastern city of Slovyansk, 110 kilometres north of Donetsk, reportedly to protect civilian lives.",0
"“There cannot be a single leader giving orders,” he declared.",0
"“Because if Strelkov suddenly decides what he wants is – in the interests of protecting the lives of Donetsk citizens and the lives of militiamen – to abandon Donetsk, then we will not follow his orders.”",0
"Khodakovsky was speaking in Makiivka, a town just outside Donetsk, where his men relocated after a reported falling-out with Strelkov.",0
The ill will also appears to stem from a feeling among the rebels that Russia has done too little to help them.,0
"“Strelkov is a military officer of non-local domicile, while we are locals and will not, therefore, allow the people of Donetsk to remain without our support and protection,” Khodakovsky said.",0
"Strelkov could go back to Russia whenever he wanted, he noted.",0
"Ukraine says Moscow is arming and supporting the rebels, charges it has denied.",0
"In another sign of deteriorating morale among the rebels, several dozen militia fighters garrisoned in a university dorm in Donetsk abandoned their weapons and fatigues in their rooms Thursday.",0
"Oleg, who declined to give his surname for fear of being punished for desertion, said he had served in the militia for a month and planned to go home to Makiivka.",0
Strelkov has admitted substantial difficulties enlisting the support of the locals in eastern Ukraine.,0
"“In truth, the number of volunteers for the several million-strong population of Donbass, for a mining region where people are used to dangerous and difficult work, has been somewhat low,” he told a rebel-run TV station this week.",0
“It is very difficult to protect this territory with the forces at our disposal.”,0
"At a news conference, the prime minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic dismissed talk of infighting.",0
“These are lies and disinformation.,0
There are no disagreements.,0
"We are now organizing our joint work,” Alexander Boroday said.",0
"He said 70,000 Donetsk residents have been evacuated from the city and more will follow.",0
He did not elaborate.,0
“Our aim was not to capture the airport.,0
"The enemy sustained serious casualties,” Strelkov said.",0
His claim could not be independently verified.,0
"Rebels regularly conduct lightning attacks on checkpoints, and earlier this week they blew up three bridges leading into Donetsk to hinder the movement of Ukrainian troops.",0
"While waging what increasingly resembles guerrilla warfare, Strelkov has said he wants to transform the rebels into a regular standing army with a unified command.",0
The rebel leadership also said this week it will pay its soldiers monthly salaries of $500 to $700.,0
The plans to create a professional army also reflect the inability to recruit more volunteers.,0
“I know many of them from school.,0
"I support them, but I am not going to fight,” said 39-year laborer Artyom Yermolyuk.",0
“What awaits them when this is all over and the Ukrainian authorities are here?”,0
Association Agreement between EU and Ukraine,0
"In Brussels, the heads of state and government of the EU and the Ukrainian Prime Minister have signed an agreement on closer political cooperation.",0
"This is a way of assuring the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people more comprehensive support, reported Chancellor Angela Merkel.",0
"In Brussels, the heads of state and government of the EU and the Ukrainian Prime Minister have signed an agreement on closer political cooperation.",0
"This is a way of assuring the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people more comprehensive support, reported Chancellor Angela Merkel.",0
Prime Minister Arsenyi Yatsenyuk and the EU heads of state and government signed the political chapters of the Association Agreement at the European Council meeting in Brussels.,0
"The European Commission will also introduce an extensive easing of customs duties on imports from Ukraine, said the Chancellor.",0
No more customs duties will be imposed on products imported to the EU from Ukraine.,0
EU pushes for observer mission,0
The EU is continuing to push for an OCSE mission in Ukraine.,0
"If all efforts fail, the EU will push to deploy its own mission, stressed Angela Merkel.",0
The heads of state and government once again stated unequivocally that the territorial integrity of Ukraine is non-negotiable.,0
"That is why we condemn the annexation of Crimea and consider it to be illegal, said the Chancellor.",0
"Consequently, we have agreed to ask the Commission to propose economic and financial restrictions regarding Crimea.",0
Further sanctions approved,0
The EU approved stage-two sanctions against a larger group of individuals.,0
"In view of the fact that no contact group has been established, and given the ""other circumstances"", the list will be extended within the scope of what is being termed stage two of sanctions.",0
Angela Merkel explained that this will involve visa bans and asset freezes.,0
"Should there be any further escalation regarding Ukraine, the EU is ready to proceed to stage three, stressed the Chancellor.",0
The Commission has been asked to start preparations for possible economic sanctions.,0
Next summit meetings cancelled,0
The Chancellor stated clearly that the next EU-Russia Summit will not take place.,0
The same applies to bilateral summits in the near future.,0
This would and will impact on the German-Russian consultations in Germany.,0
"Speaking after the European Council meeting, Angela Merkel stressed that Europe has demonstrated that it can act resolutely with one voice.",0
EU sanctions add to Putin's Crimea headache,0
A leaked copy of the EU's new Crimea sanctions indicate a near-total ban on business co-operation starting Saturday morning.,0
"It stops European entities from buying real estate, acquiring shares in Crimean firms, and providing loans or financial services.",0
"It prohibits them “to sell, supply, transfer, or export goods and technology” in the transport, telecommunications, energy, and oil and gas exploration sectors.",0
"It prevents provision of any EU services “directly relating to infrastructure … [and] tourism activities”, listing seven ports where EU cruise ships cannot call: Chernomorsk; Evpatoria; Kamysh-Burun; Kerch; Sevastopol; Theodosia; and Yalta.",0
"It also lists 165 goods and products under embargo, hitting both industry and private consumers.",0
They include: salt; sulphur; iron; nickel; rock-drilling tools; steam turbines; fridges; washing machines; fork-lift trucks; machine parts; and office equipment.,0
They also include: radio and TV broadcasting equipment; light bulbs; trucks and vans; motorcycles; and liquid crystal devices.,0
The law contains exemptions to “minimise the effect … on the civilian population” and on EU businesses.,0
It doesn’t apply to contracts signed three months or more before 20 December or to Crimea-based firms’ operations outside the region.,0
Cruise ships can keep calling until 20 March.,0
"Derogations also cover supplies to foreign consular missions, hospitals, and schools, as well as work to maintain “safety of existing infrastructure” or to protect “human health and safety … or the environment”.",0
The ban goes much further than previous Crimea sanctions in June and July.,0
"Given Russia’s financial crisis and that it has to supply Crimea by sea, it's likely to make the region, which used to live on Ukrainian subsidies, into even more of an economic headache.",0
"With Crimea’s maritime zone said to hold gas reserves, the ban on gas exploration technology will slow down efforts to cash in.",0
"EU sources say France, which has the biggest commercial interests in Crimea, tried to water down the measures.",0
It said the ban should apply only to firms which are legally domiciled in the region.,0
But the final text also embargoes “subsidiaries or affiliates under … control in Crimea”.,0
Against the grain,0
The new measures go against the grain of current EU thinking on the crisis.,0
EU leaders will take stock of Russia relations at a summit on Thursday.,0
Draft conclusions say if Russia continues to flout ceasefire accords “the EU will stay the course; the European Council is ready to take further steps”.,0
"But German, French, Russian, and Ukrainian leaders in a phone call on Wednesday spoke of diplomatic solutions.",0
"German chancellor Angela Merkel’s press release said she wants “good and co-operative relations” and ""closer"" trade ties with Moscow.",0
A senior EU diplomat told EUobserver “the mood has shifted” since she met Russian leader Vladimir Putin at a G20 event in Australia last month.,0
"“I don’t have the feeling that there'll be a new wave of economic sanctions”, he said, referring to measures beyond Thursday’s Crimea decision.",0
"Smallprint, big meaning",0
"For her part, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini has called for a review of Russia sanctions in early 2015.",0
She has little power to shape policy.,0
But the vocabulary of EU statements has changed since she arrived on 1 November.,0
"Pre-Mogherini ones referred to Russian forces in Ukraine, but post-Mogherini ones call them “foreign forces” or “illegal forces” without naming Russia.",0
"Ukraine’s ambassador to the EU, Kostiantyn Yelisieiev, recently urged EU states to call a spade a spade.",0
He wrote in a letter to EU ambassadors ahead of a Ukraine meeting on 15 December that the event “should not be an occasion for twisting language”.,0
"He said “the word ‘aggression’ should not be avoided as it is an unfortunate reality"" and that the EU should keep repeating that Crimea is “occupied” or “annexed"" by Russia.",0
Mogherini’s 15 December statement mentioned the “illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation”.,0
But it didn't use the word “aggression” and spoke of “infiltration of illegal forces … from the territory of” Russia.,0
Putin Classifying Troop Losses Proves They're in Ukraine – Analysts,0
"Legal amendments introduced Thursday that classify as state secrets any losses sustained during peacetime special operations are further confirmation of Russia's direct involvement in the Ukraine conflict, legal and military experts told The Moscow Times.",0
"The amendments, signed by President Vladimir Putin, make ""information disclosing the loss of personnel … during special operations in peacetime"" a classified state secret.",0
Putin has repeatedly denied any involvement of Russian troops in the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine.,0
"Asked to explain Putin's move Thursday, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov had no immediate comment, Reuters reported.",0
"Military servicemen who are killed, injured or go missing can be considered military losses, meaning their relatives will be forced to keep information about their deaths a secret, lawyers said Thursday.",0
"Even a death notification sent to parents or other relatives [of a soldier] can be considered a secret under this decree,"" Ivan Pavlov, a leading lawyer in the field of government transparency who has successfully defended treason suspects, told The Moscow Times.",0
"The federal list of what constitutes a state secret can be accessed publicly, but government agencies also compile their own lists that are themselves usually classified.",0
"Moreover, what the Defense Ministry classifies as a secret could be considered open information by the Interior Ministry, Pavlov said.",0
"If a citizen, for instance a journalist, obtains information that is considered a state secret, they face prison.",0
"The problem is that they might not even know it was a state secret,"" said Pavlov, who successfully defended Alexander Nikitin, a former nuclear inspector who was accused in the 1990s of espionage for raising the alarm about the dangers posed by decaying nuclear submarines.",0
Truth and Consequences,0
"Since the conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out following a popular uprising that toppled the former pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych last year, many journalists have investigated reports of Russian troops fighting — and dying — there.",0
The Kremlin denies there are Russian soldiers fighting on the side of pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine.,0
Last August the Pskovskaya Guberniya newspaper published a series of articles alleging that secret funerals had been held for paratroopers from a local regiment believed to have been killed fighting in Ukraine.,0
"One of the newspaper's main writers, Lev Shlosberg, was severely beaten by three unidentified men shortly afterwards.",0
Leading Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was also working on a report about alleged Russian troop losses in Ukraine at the time of his murder in central Moscow in February.,0
Other journalists and human rights groups have attempted to find proof that the Russian army is directly involved in helping pro-Russian insurgents in Ukraine.,0
The St. Petersburg branch of the Soldiers' Mothers Committee — an organization that campaigns to defend the rights of soldiers and their families — sent around 30 requests for information to military units that soldiers' families and media reports have identified as suffering losses in 2014.,0
"Only one unit responded in full, according to the NGO's spokesman Alexander Peredruk.",0
"The main consequence of this law is that it will basically be impossible to obtain information,"" Peredruk said in a phone interview with The Moscow Times.",0
"We won't know what the statistics are, but the truth is, we didn't know before either,"" he said.",0
"After Russia's five-day war with Georgia in South Ossetia, which was referred to as a special operation, the General Staff announced that it had lost 74 servicemen there.",0
"According to Alexander Khramchikhin, deputy director of the Institute for Political and Military Analysis think tank, there is no internationally accepted norm for classifying special military operations.",0
Each country handles these questions its own way; for many this is not an issue.,0
"In the United States, such operations are completely classified,"" he told The Moscow Times in a phone interview.",0
Ordinary Victims,0
"The key point of the legal amendments is that ordinary people will suffer as a result of them, said Grigory Pasko, a military journalist and director of the Moscow-based Foundation for Investigative Journalism.",0
"The main victims of this decree are parents and relatives and also soldiers themselves who have gone missing or were killed in combat,"" he said.",0
"A former officer of the Russian Navy, Pasko served a prison term for espionage in connection with research he did for a report on environmental issues in the Sea of Japan.",0
Pasko said the Russian state already has all the necessary means to protect its secrets.,0
"The high treason article of the Russian Criminal Code says that in addition to espionage and disclosure of state secrets, ""any other assistance rendered to a foreign state, a foreign organization or their representatives in hostile activities to the detriment of the external security of the Russian Federation"" shall be punishable by up to 20 years in prison.",0
"Svetlana Davydova, a mother of seven, was detained in January on suspicion of high treason over a phone call she made to the Ukrainian Embassy in which she warned that Russian troops might have been deployed to eastern Ukraine.",0
She was released and the charges dropped in February.,0
Lajčák reacts to Ukraine violence,0
"  A SERIES of hastily passed laws seeking to limit the right to protest added fuel to the fire of anti-government protests in the Ukrainian capital Kiev, and after a violent clash with police saw up to five demonstrators killed, the international community, including Ukraine’s western neighbour Slovakia, called for calm.",0
"“When blood was shed a red line was crossed,” Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajčák told The Slovak Spectator.",0
“This is not an academic issue for us.,0
We have very actively been supporting a European way for Ukraine.”,0
The United States has imposed visa restrictions on Ukrainian officials connected to the violence in the wake of allegations that two protesters were shot and killed by security forces.,0
Lajčák said that he imagines the European Union also must act.,0
"“There is a saying that if a leader does not want to listen to his people, he will hear from them,” Lajčák said.",0
“That is exactly what is happening in Ukraine.”,0
Prime Minister Robert Fico said on January 22 that he was shocked by the developments in Ukraine.,0
"He condemned the intervention of specialised security units in Kiev resulting in the death of several demonstrators as unacceptable, noting that Ukraine is Slovakia’s neighbour “with which we have many things in common”.",0
"“I want to appeal to all those involved in the demonstrations to refrain from any violence,” said Fico, as quoted by the SITA newswire, adding that Ukrainian authorities should respect citizens’ right to protest.",0
"According to Fico, dialogue, not force, is needed to quell the tense situation.",0
"Since late November 2013, pro-EU Ukrainians have been protesting in the streets of the country’s cities, spurred by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s last-minute decision not to sign the association agreement with the EU.",0
Some observers see pressure from Russia behind his decision and suggest that the crisis has revealed deep divisions in Ukraine between those who lean toward Moscow and those looking westward.,0
"“If one of the wealthiest men of the country, Viktor Yanukovych, is the president in Ukraine and he is backed by one of the most powerful people in the world, Russian President Vladimir Putin, then the public does not have a chance,” Oles Cheresko, a Ukrainian living in Slovakia, told the Sme daily, which addressed several Ukrainians on January 23.",0
Many were sceptical about the eventual success of demonstrators.,0
"Fico was mum on the events in Ukraine until December 3 of last year, when he said that the EU is “so in love with itself” that it is convinced there is no better alternative to it in the world, SITA reported.",0
"EU membership is not a religious rule for countries and each country can freely decide whether or not it will join, Fico said, adding that one must look at the offers that have been put in place, such as the lowering of gas prices or projects offered to Ukraine.",0
"“Ukraine simply decided to go another way and I will not judge it now, this is an internal affair [for Ukraine],” Fico said at the time.",0
"But as demonstrations have persisted and confrontations have increased in frequency and intensity, such comments are increasingly seen as out of step with the European mainstream.",0
Events on the ground appear to have make things about much more than whether Ukraine wishes to enter the EU or not.,0
"“If it is proven that it was the government, the police who killed demonstrators, we have to call on those responsible to answer,” Lajčák said.",0
"“If the European Union is true to its values, then obviously we cannot remain silent in this gross violation of not only democratic principles, but of the law.”",0
Ukraine crisis: Putin adviser accuses US of meddling,0

"A senior adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the US of meddling in Ukraine, in breach of a 1994 agreement over non-intervention.",0
"Sergei Glazyev said the US was spending $20m (£12.3m; 14.8m euros) a week on Ukrainian opposition groups, supplying ""rebels"" with arms among other things.",0
"Accusing the US of ignoring the Memorandum on Security Assurances , he suggested Moscow could also intervene.",0
The American embassy in Kiev declined to comment on his accusations.,0

"29 January: Parliament passes amnesty law for detained protesters, under the condition occupied buildings are vacated",0
"Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych is due to meet Mr Putin on Friday in Sochi, on the opening day of the Winter Olympic Games there.",0
"He held talks in Kiev with US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland on Thursday, at which he said he favoured dialogue and compromise with the opposition.",0
"Meanwhile, an audio recording has been posted online, which is purported to be a hacked phone conversation between Ms Nuland and US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, in which the female speaker dismisses EU efforts to resolve the crisis, using an expletive.",0
The two speakers also discuss frankly the merits of the three main Ukrainian opposition leaders in the conversation.,0
The US embassy declined to comment on the tape.,0
"Thousands of Ukrainian opposition activists, some carrying shields and baseball bats, marched from their camp on Independence Square in the capital Kiev to parliament in a show of force on Thursday.",0
"They came close to government supporters who are camped next to parliament behind barricades manned by hundreds of police, but the march passed off peacefully.",0
"In another development, a man received a serious hand injury when he reportedly opened a letter bomb inside one of the buildings occupied by protesters in Kiev, Trade Union House.",0
"He was rushed to hospital, police confirmed.",0
Flagrantly and unilaterally',0
"Mr Glazyev told Kommersant newspaper's Ukrainian edition: ""According to this document [the memorandum], Russia and the US are guarantors of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and, frankly speaking, they are obliged to intervene when conflict situations of this kind arise.",0
"The memorandum, which also involved the UK, was signed after Ukraine gave up its claim to any part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal after the dissolution of the USSR.",0
"Mr Glazyev, who is widely regarded as Mr Putin's chief adviser on Ukraine, gave a wide-ranging interview to Kommersant.",0
"He warned that if the opposition did not end its occupation of Independence Square, which is now into its fourth month, President Yanukovych might have no choice but to use force.",0
"In a situation when the authorities encounter a coup attempt, they simply have no choice [but to use force],"" he said.",0
Otherwise the country will be plunged into chaos.,0
"Accusing the Americans of ""interfering flagrantly and unilaterally in the internal affairs of Ukraine"", he said: ""There is information that within the grounds of the American embassy, there is training for fighters, that they're arming them.",0
"Mr Glazyev predicted the situation there would ""normalise"" if the US desisted from intervening.",0
"Russia itself has been widely accused of intervening in Ukraine, using its economic clout to persuade President Yanukovych and his allies to abandon closer ties with the EU in favour of Russia and other ex-Soviet states.",0
The current stand-off in the streets began in November after President Yanukovych refused to sign a far-reaching agreement with Brussels at the last moment.,0
It descended into violence last month after a new law to curb protests - which has since been repealed - provoked fury among the opposition.,0
"At least three protesters died in the violence, as did at least three police officers, and hundreds of people were injured.",0
The opposition accuses the security forces of abducting and torturing activists.,0
"One of these, Dmytro Bulatov, who has been receiving medical treatment in Lithuania, told reporters on Thursday he had been beaten, choked and interrogated in an ordeal lasting eight days.",0
"I was telling them lies just to stop the torture,"" said Mr Bulatov, 35.",0
At one point I asked them to kill me because I couldn't stand it anymore.,0

"“I have this morning directed that, effective immediately, all planned bilateral activities between the Canadian Armed Forces and the military of the Russian Federation be suspended.",0
"This includes exercises, such as NORAD’s Exercise Vigilant Eagle, and scheduled meetings,” Harper said in a statement.",0
“We continue to view the situation in Ukraine with the gravest concern and will continue to review our relations with President Putin’s government accordingly.”,0
"Later Tuesday during question period in the House of Commons, Harper reiterated that all G8 members have suspended their preparations for what was to be the next meeting in Sochi, scheduled for June, and suggested that members are considering holding a meeting without Russia.",0
"“In terms of a G7 meeting, I spoke to (U.S.) President (Barack) Obama on that on the weekend.",0
"I suggested that, and I know there are discussions…of the possibility of a G7 meeting in the upcoming weeks,” Harper said.",0
"The prime minister also said that given the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, “all of our economic and diplomatic bilateral relationship with Russia is under examination, will continue to be under examination and, working in concert with our allies, we will continue to search for ways to apply ongoing pressure and isolation to the Putin regime until such time as it reverses its course of action.”",0
Harper’s announcements come as tensions remain high over the crisis in Ukraine.,0
"Over the weekend, Russian forces moved into the Crimean peninsula and took control of its ferry, as well as military bases and border posts.",0
Russian Navy ships are also blocking two Ukrainian warships in the Crimean port of Sevastopol.,0
"The moves came after months of pro-democracy protests in Ukraine turned violent, killing nearly 100 people and sending President Viktor Yanukovych into hiding.",0
The Ukrainian Parliament appointed an interim president and prime minister until elections can be held.,0
"Earlier Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted to defend his military’s incursion in the Crimean peninsula, saying he is trying to protect Russian-speaking people in Ukraine and has no desire “to fight the Ukrainian people.”",0
Putin agreed to a special meeting in Brussels to discuss the situation.,0
"Meanwhile, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe announced it will send observers to Ukraine as early as Wednesday, with the intention of making their way to Crimea.",0
Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said Tuesday Canada “welcomes” the decision to send observers to Ukraine.,0
"However, Canada has yet to say whether it, too, will send a contingent.",0
"Baird met with Ukraine’s Ambassador to Canada, Vadym Prystaiko, Tuesday, and in prepared remarks, compared Putin’s move to Germany’s claim to the Sudetenland, western Czechoslovakia, in the run-up to World War II.",0
"“Canada can never accept, and the international community can never accept, ethnic nationalist justification for invading a peaceful, democratic neighbour,” Baird said before his meeting with Prystaiko.",0
“It’s not lost on the rest of the world that the same argument was made before the Second World War on the annexation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia in 1938.,0
We will continue to call on President Putin to withdraw all of his forces to their bases and to refrain from further provocative action in this part of the world.”,0
"Prystaiko thanked Canada for its ongoing support during the crisis, and said Ukraine believes “there is a chance for a diplomatic solution.”",0
Prystaiko said a threat to turf Russia from the G8 is one that Putin will take seriously.,0
"“The G8 is an important mechanism, and Russians are happy to be there in the company of those people,” he told reporters on Parliament Hill.",0
“I believe he listened to the message from Canada and other G8 members and understands the gravity of this.”,0
"Observers from the International Monetary Fund are also on the ground in Ukraine to assess the country’s financial picture, and Prystaiko said aid from Canada and the rest of the world is urgently needed.",0
Prystaiko said the country has a $35-billion debt that needs to be paid.,0
"“We’d like Canada to do something,” he said.",0
"“We’d like to ask the European partners to do more, because really we need a lot more immediately.”",0
Ukraine crisis: EU signs association deal,0
"EU leaders seal an accord on closer ties with Ukraine, as President Putin completes the treaty on Crimea's entry into the Russian Federation.",0

The political parts of the accord were signed in Brussels on Friday; the economic and trade sections will not be signed until after Ukrainian presidential elections in May.,0

Trade issues,0
The most sensitive issue of trade integration with the EU is as yet unsigned.,0
"But in its Conclusions on Ukraine , published on Friday, the EU said it was committed to signing the remainder.",0
The EU also said it would push ahead with similar co-operation deals with two former Soviet republics - Georgia and Moldova - in the summer.,0
"Moscow has troops in breakaway parts of Georgia and in Trans-Dniester, which broke away from Moldova, and our correspondent says the EU's announcement on this is likely to infuriate the Kremlin far more than any sanctions imposed so far.",1
The EU has also cancelled a summit with Russia in June and said member states would cancel regular bilateral summits.,0
Sanctions broadened,0
Friday's signing came as the EU broadened its sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea.,0
It added 12 individuals to an earlier list of 21 who now face asset freezes and travel bans.,1

"Russia’s involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable,” Carney said.",0
The United States has imposed sanctions on individuals in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.,0
"“The Department of the Treasury is imposing sanctions on seven Russian government officials, including two members of President Putin’s inner circle, who will be subject to an asset freeze and a US visa ban, and 17 companies linked to Putin’s inner circle, which will be subject to an asset freeze.",1

"Speaking in the Philippines ahead of the announcement, President Barack Obama said the goal of the sanctions was “not to go after [Russian President Vladimir] Putin personally,” but “to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he’s engaging in could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.”",0
Moscow has repeatedly warned that talking in the language of sanctions is “inappropriate and counterproductive” and warned its Western partners about the “boomerang effect” that sanctions would have.,0
"The US and EU earlier imposed targeted sanctions against Moscow over its reunification with Crimea, a former region of Ukraine that held a referendum in March in which 96 percent of population voted for integration with Russia.",0

To be honest we were not happy about the proposal.,0
I am perfectly aware about what is going on in the country now.,0
The country is on the verge of bankruptcy.,0
They've robbed the country in the past three and a half years to the extent that the treasury is empty.,0

"Pushing locals aside, Russians take top rebel posts in east Ukraine",0
"KIEV/DONETSK Ukraine (Reuters) - As Ukrainian troops gained ground in eastern Ukraine in early July, separatist leader, Aleksander Borodai, a Russian national, left for Moscow for political consultations.",0
"Vladimir Antyufeyev, deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, listens during an interview with a Reuters journalist in Donetsk July 25, 2014.",0
"After what he described as successful talks with unnamed people there, he returned to the rebel stronghold of Donetsk to introduce a new senior figure in his self-proclaimed republic, a compatriot seasoned in the pro-Russian separatist movement in Moldova and a war between Russia and Georgia.",0
"Vladimir Antyufeyev was named “deputy prime minister” by Borodai on July 10, one of several native Russians to have taken charge of the separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s eastern regions.",0
"Joining Borodai and rebel commander Igor Strelkov, Antyufeyev’s arrival underlines a change at the top of the separatist movement, highlighting Moscow’s involvement in the conflict, Western officials say.",0
The Kremlin denies any involvement.,0
"“There has been a dramatic change in the leadership of the Donetsk People’s Republic over the past weeks, which certainly gives the impression of a much more hands-on Russian directive role,” said Geoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. Ambassador to Kiev.",0
“These individuals are in regular touch with authorities in Russia.”,0
"Ukrainian-born rebel leaders have been eased out, causing rifts among increasingly nervous separatists since a Malaysian airliner was downed over rebel-held territory just over a week ago.",0
"Antyufeyev replaced Donetsk native, Alexander Khodakovsky, as the top security person in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.",0
"Denis Pushilin, another local once titled the republic’s president, was dismissed.",0
"Khodakovsky remains a top commander but has taken an increasingly independent line, telling Reuters that separatists had the type of anti-aircraft missile system that Washington says brought the plane down, killing all 298 people on board.",0
Borodai denied this assertion.,0
"A Ukrainian official in the southern Azov Sea city port of Mariupol, which Kiev reclaimed from rebels last month, said Russians were taking over the entire rebel operation, sidelining or removing locals.",0
"Antyufeyev, also known as Vadim Shevtsov, has a history of supporting pro-Russian separatist movements in the former Soviet Union, and brings a tough discipline and doggedness to the campaign in eastern Ukraine.",0
"The balding, 63-year-old says he “fought national fascism” by supporting separatists in the pro-Russian region of Transdniestria in neighboring Moldova, and in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in Georgia.",0
"At his new office at the separatists’ Donetsk headquarters, the Siberian-born Antyufeyev said he came to Ukraine because Russians were being killed by forces sent from Kiev.",0
" “I know what it is to fight for the rights of the people … I know what hot spots are,” he said in an interview.",0
A picture of Russian President Vladimir Putin looked down on the table where he sat.,0
"Asked whether there were divisions among the rebels, Antyufeyev said: “I am the authority.",0
I have no problems… ,0
"If they do not understand that, that’s their problem.",0
I am a professional in making (people) understand.”,0
"He earned a fearsome reputation when he served in Transdniestria, which split from Moldova in 1990, as the head of security operations for 20 years.",0
"Dismissed in 2012 when his ally was replaced as leader of the tiny sliver of land, he barricaded himself for three days in his study and refused to leave.",0
The EU first blacklisted Antyufeyev over his role in Transdniestria in 2004.,0
"Though it later suspended that decision, it has now blacklisted him again over Ukraine, imposing assets freezes and a travel ban on him.",0
One person who had been questioned by Antyufeyev in Transdniestria on suspicion of spying for Moldova said he was a tenacious interrogator.,0
"Speaking on condition of anonymity, for fear of reprisal, the person said Antyufeyev was “a professional”, capable of being sociable and polite, always rigidly following the chosen line.",0
"With a smile on his face, Antyufeyev would exert moral pressure, the person said.",0
"Oazu Nantoi, a Moldovan political analyst and expert on Transdniestria, predicted Antyufeyev would aim to further destabilize Donetsk and impede Kiev’s efforts to regain control.",0
“He is no romantic who came to fire a few shots.,0
He knows what his tasks are.,0
"Just as he did in Transdniestria,” he said.",0
"“Antyufeyev knows how to operate in such situations, how to suppress opposition and dissent… create an atmosphere of fear in which people will support any action by the separatists.”",0
"Washington says the influx of Russians into the upper ranks of the separatists is matched by an increased number of heavy weaponry coming across the Russian border into Ukraine, a response to advances made by the Ukrainian army on the ground.",0
"Though Borodai insists the separatists’ weaponry comes from depots they overran while seizing territory, he admits “volunteers” from Russia keep on reinforcing the rebels’ ranks.",0
"He calls his Russian trio volunteers and says their presence in the Donetsk region, or Donbass, is proof of the Russian nation’s support for the separatists’ cause.",0
“The people of Donbass rose on their own.,0
"It is normal and natural that we ended up heading this movement because of certain competences, our abilities,” he told a news conference in Donetsk earlier this month.",0
"“There will be more and more people from Moscow in the DNR (Donetsk People’s Republic),” said Borodai, flanked by Strelkov and Antyufeyev.",0
The stout Borodai denies having ever worked for the Russian security services though admits knowing many people there because of his past work as a “professional political expert.”,0
"He and Strelkov say they first met in 1996 in the Russian region of Chechnya, where Moscow has waged two wars against Islamist separatists since 1994.",0
Borodai says Strelkov has long been his “very good acquaintance”.,0
"Both said they served in Transdniestria and, more recently, in Crimea.",0
The West says they were aides to the pro-Russian separatist leader of the Black Sea peninsula who was instrumental in Moscow’s annexation earlier this year.,0
The two are on both the EU and U.S. sanctions list.,0
"Kiev and the European Union say Strelkov, whose real name is Igor Girkin, in fact served in Russia’s GRU military intelligence.",0
"Strelkov says he served at the rank of colonel in Russia’s FSB security service until quitting at the end of March, and has had battlefield experience in Transdniestria, in Bosnia’s conflict and in both Chechen wars.",0
"While he commanded rebel forces in Slaviansk, the town became a citadel of fierce resistance where at least two Ukrainian military helicopters and one warplane were brought down, giving him a hero status among separatists.",0
"Abandoning Slaviansk to Kiev’s troops on July 4-5 has, however, dented his reputation and upset some rebels.",0
"Strelkov’s acquaintances and former colleagues say he developed a reputation as an uncompromising idealist while with the FSB, though his “difficult” character may have been behind what they say was in fact his dismissal from the service.",0
"They say the ouster of Ukraine’s former, Moscow-allied president Viktor Yanukovich and Kiev’s pivot to the West was a turning point for him.",0
"An acquaintance in Moscow, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity, said Strelkov was outraged by the events in Kiev and believed Russia must not lose Ukraine.",0
The acquaintance added that Strelkov knew Borodai in Moscow and the two helped one another in business.,0
Strelkov left his home in a Moscow suburb in February traveling to Crimea where he occupied the regional parliament along with other fighters shortly before Russia annexed the predominantly ethnic Russian region.,0
He said people he had known from Crimea then asked him to come to eastern Ukraine.,0
"According to his former colleagues at the FSB, successor to the Soviet KGB, one of his favorite books was the Soviet-era science fiction novel “Hard to be God” - a tale of an agent on a mission to a different planet.",0
Chechens join Ukraine fight against Russian-backed separatists,0
Kremlin opponents based in Ukraine are planning how they can to topple Putin,0
"“Who asked for a selfie with Adam?” Amina Okuyeva wrote on Facebook last month, next to a picture of her with husband Adam Osmayev.",0
"“It’s basically just an ordinary, everyday photo.”",0
"But the snapshot, like the couple’s life, is somewhat unusual.",0
"Clad in camouflage and carrying Kalashnikovs and grenade launchers, Osmayev and Okuyeva are pictured somewhere in eastern Ukraine, where they are among a growing number of Chechens now fighting Russian-backed separatists.",0
"Moreover, the photo was taken just days after Osmayev’s release from jail in Odessa, where he had been held for nearly three years on suspicion of plotting to blow up Russian president Vladimir Putin – charges that were eventually quashed.",0
“If Ukraine loses this war it will be regarded as a victory for the Russian empire.,0
"But if Ukraine wins it will bring freedom for Chechnya and for Russia itself much closer,” Osmayev told The Irish Times by phone from the front line.",0
“And we are ready to fight to the end.”,0
"For many Ukrainians, last winter’s revolution was ultimately a struggle to end centuries of Russian domination; and Moscow’s furious, bloody and costly reaction to Kiev’s westward tilt revealed the strength of Putin’s hostility towards it.",0
"Now opponents of the Kremlin’s increasingly authoritarian rule – from Chechen rebels to veteran liberal activists – are not only drawing inspiration from Ukraine but making the war-ravaged, near-bankrupt state the base from which they hope to topple Putin’s regime.",0
"Osmayev joined an “international peacekeeping battalion” founded by Isa Munayev, who was a military leader in Chechnya during de-facto independence in the late 1990s, before Putin reasserted Moscow’s control over the region with a second war in a decade.",0
"Munayev arrived in Ukraine this year from Denmark, where he heads a Chechen diaspora group.",0
His battalion includes dozens of Chechens as well as other foreigners and Ukrainians.,0
"“But this isn’t just a military effort,” Okuyeva said, wearing a camouflage headscarf and sipping tea in a café in Kiev, during leave from the front line.",0
"“In Ukraine we can create an information platform, because the media is free.",0
We can say what we like and be heard.,0
In Russia it’s impossible to have such a platform – from here we can tell the whole world what is happening in Russia.”,0
"As Putin’s allies continue to turn the screw on media, civil society and political groups that criticise him, so Okuyeva expects more Russian dissidents to move to Ukraine.",0
"Olga Kurnosova, a familiar face and strident voice at Russian opposition rallies for more than a decade, is already here.",0
"She arrived in Ukraine from Moscow in October, having been warned by a trusted contact that Russian police were planning to arrest and frame her on some trumped-up charge.",0
"She grabbed a few essentials, told friends on a phone she thought was bugged that she was leaving for St Petersburg, and instead travelled by minibus to Belarus.",0
"At Minsk airport she waited until the last possible moment to buy a ticket for fear she would be stopped from leaving, then boarded a flight for Kiev.",0
"“I held my breath until that plane took off,” she said.",0
"Kurnosova was arrested countless times at protest rallies in Russia, spending many nights in police cells, since the days 20 years ago when she was on St Petersburg city council and Putin worked in the mayor’s office.",0
"He was such a “dull, insignificant” figure that she has few strong memories of the man whose regime she accuses of driving her from homeland, along with more than 100 other Kremlin critics whom she said have recently relocated from Russia to Ukraine.",0
"“It’s impossible to change things in Russia through elections now and by taking part you are only legitimising the corrupt system,” Kurnosova said.",0
"“We should form an opposition abroad, linking groups in Ukraine with Russian communities in places like the Baltic states and Moldova so that, when the time comes, we have a transparent, functioning system to put in place [in Russia].”",0
"Kurnosova sets no store by Putin’s huge approval ratings, saying most Russians dare to give pollsters only “politically correct” answers.",0
She thinks the country’s elite could turn on the president if his policies expose them to sustained financial pain.,0
“There is a feeling of panic in the elite already.,0
"They have no ideology – it’s all about money – and if they think they could keep their wealth by getting rid of Putin, they might do it.",0
"“If they alter their trajectory, it may be possible to change Russia without bloodshed,” Kurnosova added, “but I only give that a 5 per cent chance.”",0
"For Kurnosova, like most of her compatriots and for world leaders, the idea of Russia collapsing into bloody chaos is the stuff of nightmares.",0
"For the 250,000 or so Chechens now living abroad after fleeing war with Russia, however, such a scenario may seem like the only way to finally win independence and return home.",0
"“The last war of the Russian empire is happening here in Ukraine, which is an outpost or a fortress of European civilisation against Russia,” Okuyeva said.",0
"“When Russia loses, it will break up, and the Urals, Siberia and Chechnya and the North Caucasus will be free.”",0
"On the front line, Osmayev said “thousands” of Chechens in Europe would fight for Ukraine if Kiev legalised their status and gave them citizenship.",0
"For now, Okuyeva added, most of the Chechens on Ukraine’s side are acting as advisers to the country’s military and volunteer battalions.",0
"The separatists in eastern Ukraine have their own warriors from Chechnya, loyal to its Kremlin-backed warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, including a “death battalion” with orders to capture or kill Chechens fighting for Kiev.",0
"“We see messages online saying they are looking for us and we have information that they are active here,” Osmayev said, confirming that enemies from Russia’s bloodiest domestic conflict were now hunting each other in eastern Ukraine.",0
"“We are looking for them too,” he added.",0
“We are trying to make sure we get them first.”,0

"The apparent toppling of the pro-Russian leader looks likely to dramatically alter the future of the former Soviet republic of 46 million people, pulling it closer to Europe and away from Moscow's orbit.",1

Latest from OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine based on information received as of 27 September 2015 - OSCE,0
The SMM monitored the implementation of the “Package of measures for the implementation of the Minsk agreements”.,0
Its monitoring was restricted by the parties and security considerations*.,0
The situation remained largely calm in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions with only sparse ceasefire violations recorded by the SMM.,0
 The SMM observed considerable queues of civilian vehicles waiting at checkpoints to cross both into government-controlled and non-government controlled areas.,0
"The SMM recorded a small number of ceasefire violations in the Donetsk region, where the security situation was otherwise relatively calm.",0
"At the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) observation point at “Donetsk People’s Republic” (“DPR”)-controlled Donetsk railway station (8km north-west of Donetsk city centre), the SMM recorded on 26 September three instances of ceasefire violations between 11:28 and 13:34hrs.",0
[1] The Ukrainian Armed Forces representatives at the JCCC present at the observation point suggested the explosions were likely part of “DPR” training activities.,0
"On 27 September the SMM heard six explosions consistent with outgoing mortar or artillery fire, as well as small-arms and heavy-machine-gun fire some 1.5-2km east of its position at a filling station in government-controlled Opytne (61km north-east of Donetsk).",0

"In government-controlled Marinka (23km south-west of Donetsk) the SMM talked to several interlocutors, who expressed a strong opinion about the need for Ukrainian Armed Forces to open a passage across the contact line for the residents from the nearby villages to travel on the Kurakhove-Donetsk route.",0
"Following that the SMM discussed the issue with the civil-military co-operation officers of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in Marinka, who stated the Anti-Terrorist Operation Headquarters was considering the idea of opening the requested passage corridor.",0
"The SMM spoke to shop-owners in government-controlled Krasnohorivka (21km west of Donetsk) who indicated that they had to acquire from the city administration a permit with the list of products they were bringing through government checkpoints, and that there was a limit for the amount of goods per crossing.",0
The deputy commander at the closest relevant government checkpoint near Heorhiivka (26km south-west of Donetsk) confirmed to the SMM that local businesses indeed had to obtain a permit in order to transport goods through the checkpoint.,0

"As the SMM was about to depart from the facility, a male wearing the Russian new-style camouflage uniform without  any rank, insignia or patches, came out of the resort building and took a photograph or video of the leaving SMM vehicle, and made written notes.",0
The SMM observed an overall calm security situation in the Luhansk region with few ceasefire violations.,0
"On 26 September, from a stationary position north of government-controlled Trokhizbenka (33km north-west of Luhansk), the SMM heard in short intervals a couple of small-arms shots, three undetermined explosions, and sounds of two outgoing 82mm mortar rounds.",0
"All sounds were assessed as originating from the nearby Ukrainian Armed Forces military training area, and the SMM was informed in advance by Ukrainian Armed Forces that live-fire exercises would be conducted at this specific training facility.",0

While both markets were well equipped with food and sanitary items the SMM concluded that the cost of basic products increased by an average 5% during the month of September.,0
The SMM interlocutors at the markets claimed that the rise in prices was owed to the fact that they had to pay at the checkpoints for transporting the supplies into “LPR”-controlled areas.,0
"The SMM observed that the Russian Rouble was used as the primary currency in the market transactions, rather than the Ukrainian Hryvnia.",0
"The SMM monitored on 26 September a local ceasefire regime, through which it facilitated power line repair works near “LPR”-controlled Obozne (18km north of Luhansk).",0

"The SMM had previously recorded eight self-propelled howitzers (2S3 Akatsiya , 152mm) at one site and four self-propelled howitzers (2S1) at the second.",0

"The SMM continued to monitor the situation at the crossing points to Crimea – Kalanchak, Chaplynka, and Chonhar (95, 90, and 162km south-east of Kherson , respectively) – which remained relatively calm and stable.",0
"Activists randomly checked vehicles and drivers’ documents at their improvised check-points, which are now installed a few kilometres away from the three Ukrainian border guards crossing points.",0
"At the activists’ improvised checkpoint some 2km away from the Kalanchak crossing point, a protester who introduced herself as the Pravyi Sektor’s Press Officer told the SMM that the vehicle drivers and passengers did not object to car searches when approached by activists, and “showed their understanding of the blockade”.",0
"At Chonhar, another Pravyi Sektor activist told the SMM on 27 September that less than a quarter of the drivers passing the ‘blockade’ were contesting the activists’ efforts to conduct vehicle searches.",0
On 27 September the SMM followed up with the Odessa Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the Odessa regional police on the explosion that occurred at the headquarters of the Odessa SBU office earlier the same day.,0
The police confirmed that an unidentified explosive device in the equivalent of at least 5 kg of trinitrotoluene (TNT) had been placed near the back door of the SBU building and exploded at 04:45hrs.,0
"The SBU interlocutor told the SMM that nobody had been injured in the detonation, and that an investigation had been initiated under the “terrorism” article of Ukraine’s Criminal Code.",0
"The SMM continued to monitor the situation in Kharkiv , Dnepropetrovsk , Chernivtsi , Ivano-Frankivsk , Lviv and Kyiv .",0
"*Restrictions on SMM monitoring, access and freedom of movement:",0
"The SMM is restrained in fulfilling its monitoring functions by restrictions imposed by the parties and security considerations, including mine threats, and damaged infrastructure.",0
The security situation in Donbas is fluid and unpredictable and the ceasefire does not hold everywhere.,0
"Self-imposed restrictions on movement into high-risk areas have impinged on SMM patrolling activities, particularly in some areas not controlled by the government.",0
Members of the “LPR” continue to prevent the SMM from monitoring in some areas close to the border with the Russian Federation .,0
"Denied access: On 26 September the armed personnel at a “DPR” “traffic police” checkpoint stopped the SMM some 2km away from the Ternove shooting range, denying its passage without any explanation; On 27 September two “LPR” “border guards” stopped the SMM in “LPR”-controlled Velykyi Sukhodil (43km south-east of Luhansk), a town 1.5km away from the Ukraine-Russian Federation international border.",0
"The “LPR” members denied the SMM any further movement without a permit signed by the “LPR” leadership, demanded the SMM to leave the area, and escorted it out of town.",0
"Delayed access: During the visit of a “DPR” heavy weapons holding area on 26 September, the SMM was not allowed access to the site for 50 minutes, until the “DPR” guard received a phone call from his superior; The “DPR” armed members at a checkpoint near Ozeryanivka (32km north-east of Donetsk) delayed the SMM for 75 minutes, after which it only allowed its movement with an escort.",0
"Interference with the UAV: On 27 September, while flying over “DPR”-controlled areas north-east of government-controlled Mariupol (103km south-west of Donestk) a SMM UAV was jammed four times.",0
Referendum day in Crimea's Simferopol,0
The organizers of the Crimean referendum are pleased with the high voter turnout.,0
It is seen as a beginning of the peninsula's unification with Russia.,0
Many voters in the capital Simferopol voted in favor of secession.,0
"The beginning of the ""historical day,"" as March 16 has been referred to in Crimea by those promoting the referendum to join the Russian Federation , didn't seem promising.",0
"The previous night had been stormy and the morning saw rain over Simferopol, the capital of Crimea.",0
Ambiguity over voters and questions,0
"But despite the rain, the members of the hastily convened local electoral commission had a lot to do.",0
The new leadership had given the commission exactly 10 days to organize the vote.,0
"Meanwhile, the government in Kyiv refused to hand over the relevant voter registers to Simferopol.",0
"We used the data from the last vote,"" said election chairman Mikhail Malyshev.",0
That is how they came up with the 1.5 million ballots that were printed for the referendum.,0
"That's around one percent more than the number of voters,"" Malyshev adds.",0
"The official explanation for that discrepancy is that if voters don't vote the way they had intended to, they could have a replacement ballot card.",0
Around 1.5 million ballots papers were printed for the referendum,0
There were two questions on the ballot papers.,0
"Each question was printed in Russian, Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar, the languages of the biggest ethnic groups on the peninsula.",0
"The first question was clear enough: ""Are you in favor of Crimea being united with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?",0
"The second question was about Crimea remaining part of Ukraine with a small change to its status: ""Are you in favor of reinstating the 1992 version of the Crimean Republic's constitution and of Crimea's status as a part of Ukraine?",0
The wording was referring to a constitution that granted Crimea a broadly autonomous status.,0
It was written around the time of the fall of the Soviet Union but was abolished shortly after it was passed.,0
Against 'fascists' and for stability,0
Voters weren't given any clarification for the second question.,0
"For more than a week now, Crimeans haven't been able to receive Ukrainian analogue television stations.",0
"Russian stations are on air, however, and have been harshly criticizing the ""nationalists"" and ""bandits"" in Kyiv.",0
Crimean Igor voted in favor of secession,0
"Ukraine has betrayed us to fascists, and that is why I voted to join Russia,"" explains one young man, who says his name is Igor.",0
"An elderly couple - Arif, an Azeri, and Nina, a Russian - said they had voted for ""more stability."" ",0
They are in favor of Crimea joining Russia.,0
"We all saw what was going on in Kyiv,"" Nina explained calmly.",0
Enthusiasm and caution,0
"Alla, a 40-something-year-old head of a vocational school, is convinced that ""historic justice should win"" - this is why she has voted for Russia.",0
"Crimea has always been Russian, she says.",0
"Now she believes everything will be better, because Russia, as opposed to Ukraine, has a good leader, according to her.",0
"Meanwhile, 36-year-old Andrey is more skeptical.",0
"If Russia treats us like it does South Ossetia and Abkhazia, both of which have become poor, then we will put up resistance.",0
"Gennady, a young computer engineer is one of the few here to say that he voted for Crimea staying in Ukraine.",0
"The development in our country has shown that we now have more influence on those in power,"" he explained.",0
In Russia there's hardly any freedom.,0
Right-wing populist election observer,0
"Johann Gudenus, member of parliament in Vienna and member of the right-wing populist Freedom Party in Austria, has a different view.",0
He is one of a couple of dozen European MEPs who have been invited as observers by the organizers of the referendum.,0
"Most European politicians pander to the US, and the US often interpret international law how it suits them best,"" he told DW.",0
Gudenus only arrived in Crimea the day before the referendum.,0
"I can only talk about what I've seen, and I can't see any evidence of pressure, propaganda or military influence.",0
"Looking at the streets of Simferopol, though, you can see plenty of billboards in favor of secession of Ukraine.",0
There are no billboards at all against secession.,0
"Plus, the military is clearly visible in the streets.",0
The organizers of the referendum were keen to avoid any kind of incident during the voting process.,0
The Russian band 'Lyube' held a concert in Lenin Square in the city-center.,0
The band is known for its patriotic songs.,0
Putin is said to be a fan.,0
"Meanwhile, in a café near Lenin Square, a TV screen shows Robbie Williams singing Frank Sinatra's ""My Way.",0
" This Sunday, Crimea is going to start finding its way.",0
Latest from the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine – based on information received up until 27 April 2014,0
"Western and Central Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well the southern part of the country, remained calm.",0
The situation continued to be tense in the Luhansk region and particularly tense in the Donetsk region.,0
Two Special Monitoring Mission monitors were temporary detained by the so-called People’s Militia of Donbas in Yenakiveve (55 km northeast of Donetsk).,0
"The situation in Sloviansk, where the military observers as well as accompanying Ukrainian military officers were taken captive, remains a source of concern.",0
In Kharkiv clashes between around 400 opponents and 500 to 600 supporters of a unitary Ukrainian state occurred.,0
Police attempts to prevent the clashes between the two groups proved to be unsuccessful.,0
"Both protesting groups were joined by 15 to 20 cars with flags and people inside, some of them wearing masks.",0
Conflicting versions were conveyed to the monitors as to which group started the provocations when supporters from both sides encountered each other in the city.,0
"The situation in Luhansk surrounding the occupied state security service (SBU) building remained relatively calm, despite reported movements of armed men around the area on 26 April.",0
The situation in Donetsk remained particularly tense due to the continuing presence of armed opponents of the central Government occupying and barricading administrative buildings in the region.,0
"In Donetsk, leaflets by the so-called “People’s Republic of Donetsk” were distributed on 26 April, inviting citizens to participate in a referendum to be held on 11 May 2014 on the question of whether or not they support the proclamation of “state sovereignty” by the “Donetsk Peoples Republic”.",0
"On 27 April, two members of the Donetsk Special Monitoring Mission team were detained by a group of unarmed men at around 11.15 in Yenakiyeve (55 km northeast of Donetsk).",0
"They claimed to be part of the so-called People’s Militia of Donbas, which refuses to recognize the legitimacy of the central government.",0
The monitors were taken afterwards to the City Administration building.,0
The Special Monitoring Mission Head of Office in Kyiv reached out to the capturers and sent a letter re-confirming the identity of the monitors.,0
The monitors were allowed to return to Donetsk around 14:45.,0
"At the same time, another Special Monitoring Mission team, upon receiving permission to enter the heavily barricaded police building in Horlivka (43 northeast of Donetsk), was approached by five heavily armed and partly masked individuals.",0
"The monitors were cross-examined, accused of espionage and held for a short period of time.",0
"After a brief discussion with the occupants, the team was able to leave the scene.",0
"The Special Monitoring Mission also visited and observed a small, unmanned roadblock in Horlivka.",0
The general situation around Makiyivka Administration building was assessed as quiet and stable.,0
"The teams noticed five different flags flying at half-mast: a Donetsk Republic, a Makiyivka, a  Soviet Airborne forces, a St. George and a Donbas People’s Militia flag.",0
"In front of the back entrance, there were six unarmed men, four of whom were wearing uniforms with no insignia.",0
"Around 11:20, the team arrived in Khartzysk (30 km east of Donetsk).",0
The administration building was open with a passable barricade surrounding it.,0
The general situation at the scene was calm.,0
Also in Maryinka (34 km west of Donetsk) and Novohrodivka (56 km northwest of Donetsk) the security situation was assessed as calm and stable.,0
"The team noticed several roadblocks in the area, one of which was manned by representatives of the self-proclaimed Republic of Donetsk in camouflage clothing.",0
The situation has remained calm in Dnepropetrovsk.,0
"According to the Deputy Head of the “Right Sector”, whom the team met, the decision to move the headquarters of the organization to Dnepropetrovsk aimed at facilitating faster and more effective support to the Ukrainian forces in repelling possible attacks by armed opponents of the central government.",0
"To date, around 300 “Right Sector” activists have moved to Dnepropetrovsk from other regions.",0
"The general situation remained largely unchanged in Kherson, Mykolaiv and the surrounding area.",0
In Mykolaiv and in the region the team observed bolstering of the existing checkpoints with additional sandbags and tires.,0
"Also, more police wearing body armour as well as civil defence volunteers were observed in the area.",0
In Odessa the situation at both the “7th Kilometre” and “2 Stolba” checkpoints at the main road junctions west of the city was calm following the explosion incident on 25 April at the “7th Kilometre” checkpoint.,0
 Armed traffic police (around the “7th Kilometre checkpoint”) and police (around the “2 Stolba” checkpoint) appeared to be more active in monitoring traffic around them.,0
Several public meetings and gatherings in the city organized by different parties were held without major incidents.,0
"The overall situation in Chernivtsi, Ivano-Frankivsk , Lviv as well as in Kyiv was calm.",0
"The Chernivtsi team visited the border post in Porubne, where it observed co-operation between the border police and the local citizens belonging to the “Public Formation” volunteer group, composed of local residents.",0
"The Kyiv monitors met with Pavlo Hubariev (in Russian: Pavel Gubariev), self-proclaimed Donetsk governor, who had been detained in Donetsk on 6 March.",0
Hubariev stated that he had obtained sufficient legal assistance.,0
"However, he complained about initial harassment by the staff of the detention facility, which had ceased after the public was informed.",0
"Since 17 April he is on a hunger strike, which he intends to continue until the situation in eastern Ukraine changes.",0
Direct Line with Vladimir Putin,0
"The annual special Direct Line with Vladimir Putin was broadcast live by Channel One, Rossiya-1 and Rossiya-24 TV channels, and Mayak, Vesti FM and Radio Rossii radio stations.",0
"Especially popular in the course of the discussion were questions about Crimea, including the socioeconomic situation in Russia’s new regions – the Crimean Republic and Sevastopol, the development of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, and the situation regarding the Crimean Tatars.",0
"There were also questions about the situation in Ukraine, and the assessment of the developments in the southeast of the country.",0
"The discussion also touched upon international issues, such as relations with the West and NATO, the deployment of US anti-missile defence systems in Europe, the situation with Transnistria, and economic issues related to the global oil and gas markets.",0
"Vladimir Putin answered questions not only from citizens of Russia, but of other countries as well, for instance from experts of the Valdai Club from Germany, the US and Hungary, and a question from Edward Snowden.",0
"Numerous questions dealing with the country’s life were raised, including those related to healthcare, housing and utility services, relief efforts following the largest ever flood in the Far East last year, prospects for the future use of Olympic facilities in Sochi, as well as ways of instilling patriotism, and building relations with the opposition.",0
There were also a few personal questions.,0
"In the final part of the Direct Line, the President answered questions of his own choice.",0
"During the live television broadcast that lasted 3 hours 54 minutes, the President responded to a total of 81 questions and appeals.",0
"Direct line programme host Kirill Kleymenov: Good afternoon, You are watching Direct Line with President Vladimir Putin.",0
Here in the studio today are Maria Sittel and Kirill Kleymenov.,0
"Direct line programme host Maria Sittel: Good afternoon, I could say that we are having today yet another conversation with Vladimir Putin, however the situation is different since the country we are talking to now has changed.",0
"After waiting for 23 years, since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Crimea and Sevastopol have joined Russia.",0
"For this reason, every question today will be directly or indirectly related to Crimea.",0
"We will discuss a number of issues today, including healthcare, army, taxes, agriculture and, naturally, Ukraine.",0
There is no doubt that we’ll discuss developments in Ukraine’s southeast and the genocide that was unleashed in this region.,0
Ukraine is sliding into civil war.,0
"Kirill Kleymenov: Our colleagues Olga Ushakova, Valeriya Korableva, Tatyana Stolyarova and Dmitry Shchugorev will assist us during today’s broadcast, while Tatyana Remizova and Anna Pavlova are working in the call and SMS processing centre.",0
"I would like to remind you that you can watch us live on Channel One, as well as on Rossiya-1 and Rossiya-24 TV channels, and on Russia’s Public Television channel, where interpretation into sign language will be available for people with impaired hearing.",0
"Radio listeners can join our conversation on Mayak, Vesti FM and Radio Rossii stations.",0
We are live with President Vladimir Putin.,0
"Tatyana Remezova: Good afternoon, colleagues! Hello, Mr President.",0
"Our call centre has been working for a week, and we will continue to take calls during the Direct Line broadcast.",0
You can call us at the toll-free number 8 (800) 200–4040 or send text messages to 04040.,0
"There is a separate Moscow number, which is also toll free, for residents of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol: +7 (495) 539–2442.",0
People from other countries can call us at the number you can see on the screen.,0
"Over the past eight days, our call centre has received over two million questions, or 17,500 per minute – we are definitely going to set a new record – and many callers just say, “Thank you for Crimea.”",0
Anna Pavlova: Good afternoon.,0
I’d like to remind you that this year you can send video questions to the President from your PC or any mobile device.,0
Our operators continue to accept your messages on the websites www.moskva-putinu.ru and москва-путину.рф.,0
There is still time to record and send your questions.,1
I’d like to tell you that this is the first time that this programme will be broadcast with a sign-interpreted version on our website.,1
These new options have been introduced to increase the audience.,1
"Maria, Kirill, back to you.",1
"Kirill Kleymenov: So, about Ukraine.",1
Events are unfolding there with an incredible and sometimes alarming speed.,1
"Indeed, two months ago, during the Olympic Winter Games on February 17, no one thought that Crimea would reunite with Russia and that people in eastern Ukraine would stop armoured convoys sent from Kiev with their bare hands.",1
"Mr Putin, the first question is perfectly obvious: What do you think about the events underway in the Lugansk and Donetsk regions?",1
"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Before I answer your question, I’d like to go back a little to review recent events in Ukraine.",0
"As you know, President Yanukovych refused to sign the Association Agreement with the EU.",1
"No, he did not refuse to sign it, but said that he could not sign it on the EU conditions, because it would dramatically worsen the socioeconomic situation in Ukraine and affect Ukrainians.",1
Yanukovych said that he needed more time to analyse the document and to discuss it together with Europeans.,0
"This provoked public unrest that eventually culminated in an unconstitutional coup, an armed seizure of power.",0
"Some liked it, and some did not.",0
"People in eastern and southeastern regions of Ukraine were worried about their future and the future of their children, because they saw a rapid growth of nationalist sentiments, heard threats and saw that [the new authorities] wanted to invalidate some of the ethnic minorities’ rights, including the rights of the Russian minority.",0
"On the other hand, this description is relative, because Russians are native persons in Ukraine.",0
But an attempt was made to invalidate all decisions regarding the use of the native language.,0
"This alarmed people, of course.",0
What happened next?,0
"Instead of starting a dialogue with these people, Kiev appointed new governors – oligarchs and billionaires – to these regions.",0
People are suspicious of oligarchs as it is.,1
"They believe that they earned their riches by exploiting people and embezzling public property, and these oligarchs have been appointed to head their regions.",1
This only added to the public discontent.,1
"People chose their own leaders, but what did the new government do to them? They were thrown into prison.",1
"Meanwhile, nationalist groups did not surrender their weapons, but threatened to use force in the eastern regions.",1
"In response, people in the east started arming themselves.",1
"Refusing to see that something was badly wrong in the Ukrainian state and to start a dialogue, the government threatened to use military force and even sent tanks and aircraft against civilians.",1
It was one more serious crime committed by the current Kiev rulers.,1
"I hope that they will see that they are moving into a deep hole, and that they are pulling their country along.",1
"In this sense, the talks that will start today in Geneva are very important, because I believe that we should get together to think about ways out of this crisis and to offer people a real, not sham, dialogue.",0
"The current Kiev authorities have travelled to the eastern regions, but who do they talk to there? They talk to their appointees.",1
"There’s no need to go to Donbass for this, because they can summon them to Kiev for a meeting.",1
"They should talk with people and with their real representatives, with those whom people trust.",0
"They should release the arrested [opponents], help people to express their opinion in an organised manner, suggest new leaders and start a dialogue.",1
"People in the eastern regions are talking about federalisation, and Kiev has at long last started talking about de-centralisation.",0
"But what do they mean? To be able to understand what they mean, they should sit down at the negotiating table and search for an acceptable solution.",1
"Order in the country can only be restored through dialogue and democratic procedures, rather than with the use of armed force, tanks and aircraft.",0
"Kirill Kleymenov: So far the dialogue has started between diplomats: top diplomats from the United States, Russia, the European Union and Ukraine are meeting in Geneva at this very moment.",0
Russia is represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.,0
Could you outline Russia’s stance at the talks in just a few words?,1
Vladimir Putin: I just did exactly that.,0
"We feel strongly that this should not be a sham dialogue between representatives of the authorities, but a dialogue with the people to find the compromise I was talking about.",1
"Kirill Kleymenov: How would you respond to the statements coming from both Kiev and the West about Russia being behind the protests in eastern Ukraine, allegedly staged and financed by “Moscow’s hand”? They even claim that certain Russian armed units are there.",0
Vladimir Putin: Nonsense.,1
"There are no Russian units in eastern Ukraine – no special services, no tactical advisors.",1
"All this is being done by the local residents, and the proof of that is the fact that those people have literally removed their masks.",1
"So I told my Western partners, “They have nowhere to go, and they won’t leave.",1
This is their land and you need to negotiate with them.”,1
Maria Sittel: I’m sure we’ll get back to the events in the southeast later in the course of this conversation.,1
Now let’s talk about Crimea and how you took the decision.,1
Putin 'deserves medal' for pushing Ukraine towards EU,0
"A Ukrainian opposition leader jokingly said yesterday (29 August) that by staging a trade war against Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin “deserved a medal” for boosting Kyiv's chances of signing its Association Agreement with the EU in November.",0
"Arseniy Yatsenyuk, leader of the Batkivschchyna party of jailed former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, said that after the Vilnius Eastern Partnership summit on 28 and 29 November, when Ukraine is expected to sign its EU Association Agreement, he would ask that Putin be awarded for achieving this goal.",0
"Yatseniuk and two other parliamentary opposition leaders, Vitali Klitschko (UDAR) and Oleh Tiahnybok (Svoboda), spoke to the Brussels press yesterday together with Enlargement and Neighbourhood Commissioner Štefan Füle.",0
"“Russians have decided to make punitive actions against Ukraine,” Yatseniuk said, referring to the recently launched trade war against his country, which he said paved the way for Ukraine's EU integration.",0
"“The Berlin wall fell more than 20 years ago, and there is no need to construct a new one.",0
"But these guys in Moscow want to build it on the Ukrainian-EU border,” Yatseniuk said, speaking in English.",0
"On 22 August, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow may have to use protective measures should Ukraine sign a trade agreement with the EU.",0
"Russia is pushing Ukraine to become part of its Customs Union, already joined by Belarus and Kazakhstan.",0
Brussels has made it clear that membership of the Customs Union and association status with the EU are incompatible.,0
"Asked by EURACTIV if he thought that a recent document published by Zerkalo Nedeli, which appears to be a leaked Kremlin strategy to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s orbit, is genuine and if it should be taken seriously by EU leaders, Yatseniuk said:",0
“We are not the experts to determine the signature of this action plan.,0
But look at the actions the Russians are taking and look at the language of this document.,0
They are similar.,0
"It seems to me that this action plan is quite authentic,” Yatseniuk said.",0
Russia’s ‘action plan’?,0
"The  14-page document , the authenticity of which cannot be verified, says that the eventual membership of Ukraine to the Russian-sponsored Customs Union would bring additional trade exchange to the volume of $9 billion (€6.7 billion), while the proposed EU-Ukraine free-trade agreement would worsen Kyiv’s trade balance by $1.5 billion (€1.12 billion).",0
"This largely corresponds to a recent statement by Russian presidential advisor Sergei Glyazev, who said that signing the free trade agreement with the EU would be “suicidal” for Ukraine.",0
"The paper indicates that Russia will deploy all efforts to prevent Ukraine from signing the EU pact, and that it will strongly back pro-Russian candidate Viktor Medvedchuk at the 2015 presidential election.",0
"‘Ukrainian Choice’, the political party of Medvedchuk, is envisaged to play a leading role in promoting the country’s accession to the Customs Union.",0
"Indeed, over a recent visit to Ukraine, Putin reportedly spent only 15 minutes in a meeting with his counterpart Yanukovich, but attended a long event hosted by Medvedchuk.",0
"Among the measures envisaged in the paper is “neutralising the media impact” of pro-European forces in Ukraine by supporting opinion makers who are favourable to Russia, as well as ""sanctioning” pro-European Ukrainian oligarchs.",0
"The goal is for Ukraine to join the Customs Union in 2015, according to the document.",0
"The paper also envisions that pro-European civil servants in Ukraine institutions, especially in the ministry of foreign affairs and the ministry of defence, “who are de facto agents for Euro-Atlantic influence”, should be “discredited” and not allowed to remain in office after the presidential election.",0
"The paper also advises that President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko should put pressure on his Ukrainian counterpart Viktor Yanukovych and convince him to turn to Moscow, as EU leaders ""don't like him anyway"".",0
"However, recent developments between Russia and Belarus would most likely discourage any country to join the Customs Union.",0
"Tension between Russia and Belarus rose yesterday, as Moscow warned oil supply cuts to its energy-poor neighbour could last for months, and Minsk threatened to open a criminal case against a Russian tycoon with Kremlin ties.",0
Positions,0
"Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych said yesterday (29 August) that he was convinced his country would sign a free-trade deal with the European Union as part of a broader association agreement, the Russian agency RIA Novosti reported.",0
"“For today, I see no obstacles to signing this document,” he said in comments aired on Ukrainian television.",0
“All requirements put forward by the European Union will be met.,0
I have no doubts about that.”,0
"Yanukovych also commented on the “trade war”, describing it as “hasty” and “ill-thought-out.”",0
"He said Russia and Ukraine, who have had a series of politically driven commercial spats since the fall of the Soviet Union, should find a “pragmatic solution” on how to manage their economic relations.",0
“I’m far from [thinking] that we should make our relations with Russia and Customs Union states more complicated.,0
"On the contrary, we should think of how to make them simpler and search for mutual understanding,” he said.",0
"“The Russian president is also concerned about this issue, because he clearly understands that any complicated situation concerning these ties would affect both Ukraine and Russia.”",0
An  association agreement between the EU and Ukraine  was initialled more than a year ago  and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) was agreed as well in principle.,0
"However, the EU made their signature conditional on progress made in areas such as democratic and judicial reforms, including the release from prison of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko.",0
"The draft agreement offers closer political and economic cooperation, but stops short of offering a path towards EU accession.",0
"Ukraine hopes to sign the agreement at the 28-29 November Eastern Partnership Summit, to be held in Vilnius under the Lithuanian EU presidency.",0
"Several EU leaders, especially from the former Soviet bloc countries, are pushing for a signature of the association agreement in Vilnius, out of geopolitical considerations.",0
"Lithuania, which took over the rotating presidency on 1 July, puts high hopes on the summit's success.",0
Ukraine hopes to sign the agreement there.,0
Lessons identified in Crimea – does Estonia's national defence model meet our needs?,0
The annexation of Crimea in late February 2014 raises a number of questions about whether Estonia's own national defence system is adequate.,0
The military part of the national defence development plan approved last year states that Estonia can only benefit from units that consist of trained personnel and possess the specific equipment and weaponry they require.,0
"Given the events in Crimea, we can of course only concur with the planners, but do the core elements of Estonia’s military national defence system meet the current needs?",0
Rapid action by the forces of the Russian Federation,0
It took very little time for the forces of the Russian Federation to occupy strategic sites in Crimea.,0
"At 4:00 AM on 27 February 2014, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin gave the order to launch an exercise on the Black Sea involving 36 ships and 7,000 troops.",0
In the hour that followed – starting around 4:00 AM local time – about 30-50 Russian special forces members entered and occupied the parliament and government buildings of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.,0
There should have been a swift response to the developments in Crimea.,0
"Indeed, had the Ukrainian leadership acted rapidly and forcefully, utilising the forces at its disposal, the advances made by Russian special forces could have been hindered and possibly halted.",0
"Unfortunately, such orders never even reached the military structures.",0
"In the 20 hours following the order to launch exercises on the Black Sea, Russia was capable of seizing three strategic sites on the Black Sea, using approximately 150 special forces personnel.",0
"After 40 hours, about 2,200 special forces units and airborne troops had been deployed.",0
The first news that the parliament and government building had been occupied mentioned only “armed pro-Russian individuals” and this made it more difficult to take adequate measures.,0
The military victory was clinched.,0
The Ukrainian leadership and the rest of the world had been presented a fait accompli.,0
"Throughout its invasion of Crimea, Russia counted on two key factors to minimise the risk of bloodshed among its own forces and maximise the chances for success: (1) A brand new Ukrainian central government in disarray; and (2) No prospect for a military response by NATO.",0
How would Estonia have fared in a similar situation?,0
"If we put Estonia in the same place as Ukraine, what would have been Estonia’s chances of adequately responding?",0
"Above all, an attack would, similarly to Crimea, focus on airfields and harbours that would make it possible to rapidly deploy additional forces into Estonia, as well as on local government institutions, which would have more of a political role.",0
"Unlike Crimea, forces can also be deployed and fanned out across the country using the southeastern Estonian road network.",0
The mobilisable reserve forces form the main bulwark of Estonia’s military defences.,0
The primary role of the Estonian Defence Forces in peacetime is to prepare reserve units by training conscripts and reservists.,0
Less emphasis is laid on training professional units and sub-units manned by members of the voluntary defence organisation Kaitseliit .,0
"In Estonia, conscription is currently organised as a training cycle repeated at regular intervals.",0
Units manned by conscripts that have completed their training cycle do not remain on active duty.,0
Conscripts are assigned to the reserves and sent home.,0
"To this point, it has been considered a sound practice because since the 1990s, the Russian armed forces have been considered to have their hands full dealing with internal problems.",0
"Thus Estonian defence planners assumed that the security environment would deteriorate only gradually, allowing the country’s political and military leaders time to calmly prepare and procure more ammunition, mobilise reserve units and carry out additional training.",0
Today it is obvious that the general security situation has grown significantly worse.,1
"Should a Crimea scenario arise, the Estonian Defence Forces would not have time to mobilise reserve units.",0
"Moreover, there would be no point in pitting conscripts with only limited training against Russian special forces who would already have seized and taken up defence of sites of strategic importance.",1
"If we analyse the dates when conscripts are called up for compulsory military service in 2014 and the number of conscripts, we see that only in the first five months of the year there are significant number of conscripts who would be capable of operating at least on a platoon level.",0
"The Defence Forces also have a smaller contingent consisting of rapid-response units (above all, the Scouts Battalion and also a special operations unit) manned with active duty personnel.",0
"In recent years Kaitseliit has increased its membership at a stable pace and as of the end of 2012, the organisation had around 13,200 active members.",0
"Yet caution should be exercised in using this number, because all active members do not belong to units that have trained together, although their commitment to defend their country can be assumed to be high.",0
"According to the new national defence development plan, Estonia’s military defence capacity will grow significantly in the decade ahead.",0
"Larger numbers, however, do not necessarily ensure sufficient security in a situation where a highly capable enemy is acting decisively.",0
An attacker may intentionally sow doubts as to whether the country has fallen victim to aggression or whether it is merely a criminal group that has managed to occupy a building.,0
"This “fog” may cause mobilisation to be put off so long that the adversary could occupy key sites and thereby make mobilisation difficult, if not impossible.",0
The deployment of allied forces to Estonia before or during a possible military attack is one of the most important aspects of NATO membership.,0
"The main value of belonging to the alliance lies in military deterrence through all members’ commitment to collective defines under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which should lead potential adversaries to abandon the idea of military aggression in the first place.",0
"But if a Crimea-type, “creeping” invasion scenario involving special forces should come to pass, Estonia would have very limited immediate support from the allied units.",0
"The NATO Air Policing Mission, even with its recent strengthening in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, would offer primarily symbolic support.",0
"The key deterrent is therefore deployment of NATO ground troops to Estonia – either permanently or by prepositioning equipment, allowing the units’ personnel to be deployed relatively quickly if a crisis develops.",0
A new aspect seen with regard to Russia is its ability to incite revolts and unrest on foreign soil while rapidly deploying military forces to aggravate and exploit the resultant political turmoil.,0
The question is about what measures Estonia could implement to allow it to respond immediately and forcefully to military aggression.,0
"On the national level, the transition from peacetime to wartime must be seamless and ensure continuity of leadership.",0
Command exercises must be regularly held for Estonia’s political and military leaders.,0
"The responsibility of every government agency should, as a crisis deepens, remain as little changed as possible, without complex and risky transitions.",0
The simplest and most logical move is to base all activities that take place across all agencies in both peacetime and wartime on a uniform set of principles.,0
"Estonia will always be unable to win a war of sheer numbers against its eastern neighbour, so it must focus on quality.",0
"This will require units in a high state of readiness, fully manned, well trained and equipped.",0
The question facing Estonian defines planners is therefore whether the Defence Forces in the future should focus on reserves or on ensuring the existence of highly capable units that can be used immediately.,0
The events in Crimea show that the latter should be a priority.,0
"Undoubtedly radical measures should be considered, such as increasing the number of units manned with active duty personnel.",0
Another possibility is to extend the duration of conscription so that the units that are trained during compulsory military service are not immediately assigned to the reserves but instead left on active duty for a time.,0
"This is the option being explored in Norway, where an 18-month term of service is being attempted that would allow conscripts to be used for up to six months.",0
"Kaitseliit , too, should include sub-units at a high state of readiness, with a training level and equipment that allows them to be used against an opponent’s elite units.",0
"In parallel to Estonia’s efforts, its NATO allies should be asked to increase its presence in the Baltic States, one that goes beyond NATO’s current Air Policing Mission.",0
"In the light of Russia’s aggression against Georgia and Ukraine, the lack of a NATO military presence in a state neighbouring Russia appears to provide an incentive for Moscow to consider using force to pursue political objectives.",0
"Thus, the permanent stationing of NATO ground units and/or prepositioning of equipment in some of the Baltic States could be of critical importance to deterring potential aggressors in coming months and years.",0
Meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club,0
Vladimir Putin took part in the final plenary meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club’s XI session.,0
The meeting’s theme is The World Order: New Rules or a Game without Rules.,0
"This year, 108 experts, historians and political analysts from 25 countries, including 62 foreign participants, took part in the club’s work.",0
"The plenary meeting summed up the club’s work over the previous three days, which concentrated on analysing the factors eroding the current system of institutions and norms of international law.",0
Excerpts from transcript of the final plenary meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club’s XI session,0
"PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA VLADIMIR PUTIN : Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, friends, it is a pleasure to welcome you to the XI meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club.",0
It was mentioned already that the club has new co-organisers this year.,0
"They include Russian non-governmental organisations, expert groups and leading universities.",0
The idea was also raised of broadening the discussions to include not just issues related to Russia itself but also global politics and the economy.,0
I hope that these changes in organisation and content will bolster the club’s influence as a leading discussion and expert forum.,0
"At the same time, I hope the ‘Valdai spirit’ will remain — this free and open atmosphere and chance to express all manner of very different and frank opinions.",0
Let me say in this respect that I will also not let you down and will speak directly and frankly.,0
"Some of what I say might seem a bit too harsh, but if we do not speak directly and honestly about what we really think, then there is little point in even meeting in this way.",0
"It would be better in that case just to keep to diplomatic get-togethers, where no one says anything of real sense and, recalling the words of one famous diplomat, you realise that diplomats have tongues so as not to speak the truth.",0
We get together for other reasons.,0
We get together so as to talk frankly with each other.,0
"We need to be direct and blunt today not so as to trade barbs, but so as to attempt to get to the bottom of what is actually happening in the world, try to understand why the world is becoming less safe and more unpredictable, and why the risks are increasing everywhere around us.",0
Today’s discussion took place under the theme: New Rules or a Game without Rules .,0
I think that this formula accurately describes the historic turning point we have reached today and the choice we all face.,0
There is nothing new of course in the idea that the world is changing very fast.,0
I know this is something you have spoken about at the discussions today.,0
"It is certainly hard not to notice the dramatic transformations in global politics and the economy, public life, and in industry, information and social technologies.",0
Let me ask you right now to forgive me if I end up repeating what some of the discussion’s participants have already said.,0
It’s practically impossible to avoid.,0
"You have already held detailed discussions, but I will set out my point of view.",0
It will coincide with other participants’ views on some points and differ on others.,0
”The world is full of contradictions today.,0
We need to be frank in asking each other if we have a reliable safety net in place.,0
"Sadly, there is no guarantee and no certainty that the current system of global and regional security is able to protect us from upheavals.",0
"The international and regional political, economic, and cultural cooperation organisations are also going through difficult times.“",0
"As we analyse today’s situation, let us not forget history’s lessons.",0
"First of all, changes in the world order – and what we are seeing today are events on this scale – have usually been accompanied by if not global war and conflict, then by chains of intensive local-level conflicts.",0
"Second, global politics is above all about economic leadership, issues of war and peace, and the humanitarian dimension, including human rights.",0
The world is full of contradictions today.,0
We need to be frank in asking each other if we have a reliable safety net in place.,0
"Sadly, there is no guarantee and no certainty that the current system of global and regional security is able to protect us from upheavals.",0
"This system has become seriously weakened, fragmented and deformed.",0
"The international and regional political, economic, and cultural cooperation organisations are also going through difficult times.",0
"Yes, many of the mechanisms we have for ensuring the world order were created quite a long time ago now, including and above all in the period immediately following World War II.",0
"Let me stress that the solidity of the system created back then rested not only on the balance of power and the rights of the victor countries, but on the fact that this system’s ‘founding fathers’ had respect for each other, did not try to put the squeeze on others, but attempted to reach agreements.",0
"The main thing is that this system needs to develop, and despite its various shortcomings, needs to at least be capable of keeping the world’s current problems within certain limits and regulating the intensity of the natural competition between countries.",0
"It is my conviction that we could not take this mechanism of checks and balances that we built over the last decades, sometimes with such effort and difficulty, and simply tear it apart without building anything in its place.",0
Otherwise we would be left with no instruments other than brute force.,0
What we needed to do was to carry out a rational reconstruction and adapt it to the new realities in the system of international relations.,0
"But the United States, having declared itself the winner of the Cold War, saw no need for this.",0
"Instead of establishing a new balance of power, essential for maintaining order and stability, they took steps that threw the system into sharp and deep imbalance.",0
"The Cold War ended, but it did not end with the signing of a peace treaty with clear and transparent agreements on respecting existing rules or creating new rules and standards.",0
This created the impression that the so-called ‘victors’ in the Cold War had decided to pressure events and reshape the world to suit their own needs and interests.,0
"If the existing system of international relations, international law and the checks and balances in place got in the way of these aims, this system was declared worthless, outdated and in need of immediate demolition.",0
"Pardon the analogy, but this is the way nouveaux riches behave when they suddenly end up with a great fortune, in this case, in the shape of world leadership and domination.",0
"Instead of managing their wealth wisely, for their own benefit too of course, I think they have committed many follies.",0
We have entered a period of differing interpretations and deliberate silences in world politics.,0
International law has been forced to retreat over and over by the onslaught of legal nihilism.,0
Objectivity and justice have been sacrificed on the altar of political expediency.,0
Arbitrary interpretations and biased assessments have replaced legal norms.,0
"At the same time, total control of the global mass media has made it possible when desired to portray white as black and black as white.",0
"In a situation where you had domination by one country and its allies, or its satellites rather, the search for global solutions often turned into an attempt to impose their own universal recipes.",0
This group’s ambitions grew so big that they started presenting the policies they put together in their corridors of power as the view of the entire international community.,0
But this is not the case.,0
"”The Cold War ended, but it did not end with the signing of a peace treaty with clear and transparent agreements on respecting existing rules or creating new rules and standards.",0
This created the impression that the so-called ‘victors’ in the Cold War had decided to pressure events and reshape the world to suit their own needs and interests.“,0
The very notion of ‘national sovereignty’ became a relative value for most countries.,0
"In essence, what was being proposed was the formula: the greater the loyalty towards the world’s sole power centre, the greater this or that ruling regime’s legitimacy.",0
We will have a free discussion afterwards and I will be happy to answer your questions and would also like to use my right to ask you questions.,0
And during the upcoming discussion let someone try to disprove the argument that I just set out.,0
The measures taken against those who refuse to submit are well-known and have been tried and tested many times.,0
"They include use of force, economic and propaganda pressure, meddling in domestic affairs, and appeals to a kind of ‘supra-legal’ legitimacy when they need to justify illegal intervention in this or that conflict or toppling inconvenient regimes.",0
"Of late, we have increasing evidence too that outright blackmail has been used with regard to a number of leaders.",0
"It is not for nothing that ‘big brother’ is spending billions of dollars on keeping the whole world, including its own closest allies, under surveillance.",0
"Let’s ask ourselves, how comfortable are we with this, how safe are we, how happy living in this world, and how fair and rational has it become? Maybe, we have no real reasons to worry, argue and ask awkward questions? Maybe the United States’ exceptional position and the way they are carrying out their leadership really is a blessing for us all, and their meddling in events all around the world is bringing peace, prosperity, progress, growth and democracy, and we should maybe just relax and enjoy it all?",0
"Let me say that this is not the case, absolutely not the case.",0
A unilateral diktat and imposing one’s own models produces the opposite result.,0
"Instead of settling conflicts it leads to their escalation, instead of sovereign and stable states we see the growing spread of chaos, and instead of democracy there is support for a very dubious public ranging from open neo-fascists to Islamic radicals.",0
Why do they support such people? They do this because they decide to use them as instruments along the way in achieving their goals but then burn their fingers and recoil.,0
"I never cease to be amazed by the way that our partners just keep stepping on the same rake, as we say here in Russia, that is to say, make the same mistake over and over.",0
They once sponsored Islamic extremist movements to fight the Soviet Union.,0
Those groups got their battle experience in Afghanistan and later gave birth to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.,0
"The West if not supported, at least closed its eyes, and, I would say, gave information, political and financial support to international terrorists’ invasion of Russia (we have not forgotten this) and the Central Asian region’s countries.",0
Only after horrific terrorist attacks were committed on US soil itself did the United States wake up to the common threat of terrorism.,0
"Let me remind you that we were the first country to support the American people back then, the first to react as friends and partners to the terrible tragedy of September 11.",0
Russian Paratroops in Ukraine: Lost in a Game of Thrones,0
"A slew of reports about Russian paratroopers slain or captured in Ukraine have reignited fears of a Russian invasion in the war-torn country, but confusion reigned supreme, indicating that the stories are above all part of the propaganda battle.",1
"The reports came ahead of a long-awaited meeting of the Russian and Ukrainian presidents in Minsk, and both sides were ramping up psychological pressure ahead of the event as part of the media war, experts said.",1
"The reports may be based on facts, but one thing was clear: A military intervention was out of the question, analysts on both sides told The Moscow Times on Tuesday.",1
"The truth is extremely hard to determine … but this [reports of Russian soldiers captured in Ukraine] is an isolated incident, in any case,"" said Mikhail Pogrebinsky of the Center of Political and Conflict Studies in Kiev.",1
This an edited version of one of four videos published on the official website of the Ukrainian security service on Tuesday claiming to show testimonies from Russian servicemen captured in Ukraine.,1
Two incidents involving Russian paratroopers have been reported: One concerned a platoon of Russian paratroopers that allegedly perished last week in a clash in Ukraine's Luhansk region.,0
"The other involved 10 alleged Russian soldiers captured in Ukraine, four of them interrogated on camera.",1
Evidence in both cases is murky and to a large extent circumstantial.,1
"Below, The Moscow Times offers a summary of both incidents, complete with sources and unanswered questions.",0
Story 1: Casualties,0
"A handful of Russian paratroopers were interred in Russia recently, the circumstances of death unclear.",1
"Officials are reluctant to comment, and so are relatives — possibly under non-disclosure agreements or threat of losing state pensions or other means of support.",1
Critics say the paratroopers were sent to support the pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine and died fighting the Ukrainian army.,1
Proof and Sources:,0
• At least two paratroopers were confirmed to have been buried Monday in Russia's Pskov region.,1
• Ukrainian journalist Roman Bochkala last week published photos of Russian IDs and military documents allegedly found on paratroopers' bodies.,1
• Some relatives confirmed the deaths on social networks and in comments to the opposition paper Novaya Gazeta and independent news site Fontanka.ru.,1
Questions:,0
"• Defense Ministry spokespeople denied Russia had sent or lost any troops in Ukraine, said Bochkala's documents were fakes and claimed the dead paratroopers had been killed in an accident during a military exercise in the Pskov region.",1
• Some relatives said the online statements purportedly written by them confirming the paratroopers' deaths had been fabricated by hackers.,1
"• The identities of other relatives, including a man cited by Novaya Gazeta and Fontanka.ru, could not be independently verified.",1
Story 2: Captives,0
"The press service of Ukraine's ""counterterrorist operation,"" as Kiev terms its campaign against the insurgents, on Tuesday released videos of four men who identify themselves on camera as Russian paratroopers.",0
"The men say their command sent them on a 70-kilometer march without explaining its purpose or warning that they would be in Ukrainian territory, where they were apprehended by Ukrainian forces and surrendered without a fight.",1
Proof and Sources:,0
• Interviews of the four men's interrogations.,0
"In one case, the video shows a captive wearing Russian dog tags.",0
"• Unnamed Russian military sources confirmed the soldiers' capture to Interfax and ITAR-Tass (the Defense Ministry did not return repeated requests for comment by The Moscow Times on Tuesday), but said the soldiers had lost their way and ""accidentally"" strayed into Ukraine during a mission on the Russian border.",1
Questions:,0
• The point of contention is why and how the paratroopers ended up in Ukraine.,0
• Ukraine's supporters say the incident proves Russia's direct military support for the insurgents.,0
• Russia says it was an unintentional incursion.,1
"Separately, the Kremlin's rights council said Tuesday that a Russian military recon group of nine people had been killed ""on the Ukrainian border.",1
"The advisory body, whose outspoken criticism of the Kremlin usually goes unheeded, cited a committee of soldiers' mothers as its source and asked the Investigative Committee to look into the alleged deaths.",1
"The committee did not comment Tuesday, while the Defense Ministry denied the report, Gazeta.ru reported.",0
No Invasion Before Talks,0
Military and political experts polled by The Moscow Times said the evidence available did not make it possible to say with any degree of certainty whether any Russian paratroops have really fought in Ukraine recently.,1
"But the scandal benefitted the Ukrainian leadership while harming Russia's position in the Minsk talks, said Alexander Khramchikhin of the Institute for Political and Military Analysis in Moscow.",1
"Russia is extremely unlikely to go for a serious escalation ahead of the all-important Minsk meeting,"" said Anton Lavrov, a military expert working with the Moscow-based Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies.",1
"Moscow and Kiev effectively ended dialogue with the outbreak of a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine last spring, but the meeting between Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was anticipated as a chance to resume direct talks.",1
"The rebels recently reported launching a counteroffensive after weeks of retreat, claims that many experts also said seemed to be propaganda aimed at strengthening Moscow's position ahead of the talks.",1
"Ukraine has accused official Moscow of providing the rebels with money, equipment and possibly troops.",1
"But all experts interviewed for this story said that while many Russian volunteers were confirmed to be fighting in Ukraine, hard evidence of Russia's direct military involvement was lacking.",1
Game of Thrones,0
"The paratrooper reports are part of the heated media battle being waged in parallel to real-life hostilities, Lavrov said.",1
"The information war has reached uncharted heights,"" Khramchikhin said.",1
"Media and officials on both sides have been locked in a mutual smear campaign for months, trading exaggerations and outright fakes about casualties and atrocities committed by the enemy.",1
"Direct Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine remains the most powerful accusation on the Ukrainian side, repeatedly reported but never confirmed.",1
"Russia has been more creative, with state media vilifying the Ukrainian army and authorities with zeal and inventiveness.",1
"The most notorious example came in July, when state-run Channel One said Ukrainian ""fascists"" had crucified the child of a Russia supporter in a town square.",0
"The story was eventually debunked as a fake based on a scene from the hit fantasy TV show ""Game of Thrones.",0
The Faces Behind Ukraine's Rebel Election Observer Mission,0
"The recent elections in Ukraine's self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics may have been slammed by Western governments, but they were praised by a ragtag group of ""international observers.",0
"The recent elections in Ukraine's self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics may have been slammed by Western governments, but they were praised by a ragtag group of ""international observers"" including a Spaniard who may not exist, a Nashville lawyer previously suspended for fraud, a far-right Serbian denied entry into Canada for his affiliation with convicted war criminals, and an Austrian nationalist renowned among U.S. neo-Nazis.",0
"The list of observers released by Ukraine's Interior Ministry the day after the vote — called ""unfortunate and counterproductive"" by the UN secretary general and described as a farce by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko — includes 18 names, though Russian media and foreign journalists present at the elections said the number of international observers was much higher, with estimates ranging from 50 to 70.",0
"The organizations involved include the Eurasian Observatory of Democracy and Elections, run by Belgian neo-Nazi Luc Michel; the European Centre for Geopolitical Analysis, run by Polish far-right politician Mateusz Piskorski; and the Agency for Security and Cooperation in Europe (ASCE), which was founded the night before the vote and apparently dismantled immediately after.",0
"That agency's founder, Ewald Stadler, a far-right Austrian politician whose 2010 speech was dubbed ""the most racist speech ever"" in a European parliament by neo-Nazi website Stormfront.org, admitted in Donetsk that the ASCE did not legally exist, according to British newspaper The Telegraph.",0
Piskorski of the European Centre for Geopolitical Analysis previously worked as an election observer at the 2007 Russian State Duma elections.,0
But he is perhaps better known for publishing a magazine called Odala throughout the 1990s and early 2000s that openly praised Nazi Germany and featured various interviews with Holocaust deniers.,0
"Piskorski is also a member of the International Eurasian Movement, founded by Alexander Dugin, an ultraconservative Russian political analyst with ties to the Kremlin. ",0
"In addition to European political figures with a track record of observing unrecognized elections, the list also included some more obscure but no less colorful figures.",0
Elusive Lawyer,0
"One of them is U.S. national Frank G.Abernathy, listed as representing the Tennessee-based company EFS Investment Partners LLC, whose Facebook page says it offers ""financial planning"" services.",0
"The company's offices have closed, the phone is disconnected and no online reviews by clients could be found about the company's services.",0
Abernathy is also the founder of the Law Offices of Frank G.Abernathy — whose phone has also been disconnected — and a practicing lawyer.,0
"But according to the Tennessee Bar Association, his license was only reinstated in 2011 after being suspended in 2002.",0
"The Supreme Court of Tennessee fined and suspended Abernathy after he ""used confidential information to his advantage"" and ""engaged in misrepresentation"" to borrow a large sum of money from one of his clients.",0
"Several phone numbers listed for Abernathy were found to be disconnected, including one for a Bermuda-based insurance company he claims to work for.",0
A message sent to him on social media went unanswered by print time.,0
Crimean Veteran,0
"American-Serbian professor, writer and fellow observer Srda Trifkovic was easier to get a hold of.",0
"Offering his impression of Sunday's election, Trifkovic said that residents in Donetsk seemed eager to vote — but he conceded that that was ""quite apart from the issue of the 'legality' of the election.",0
"He said he was invited by representatives of the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) a month in advance, and they ""made the travel, board and lodging arrangements, but there was no honorarium involved.""  ",0
"Overall, the process was as democratically valid as could be expected under the extraordinary security circumstances,"" he said, adding that ""in view of the long, cold winter on the horizon and Ukraine's ongoing financial and economic collapse,"" the authorities in Kiev should ""heed the dictate of expediency"" and talk to the new DNR leaders.",0
"Trifkovic said he also observed the Crimean referendum in March, which was likewise universally dismissed by Western governments and influential international organizations.",0
"Like many of the other observers, Trifkovic has an extensive resume but a spotty reputation, having authored numerous books and done stints as a correspondent for the BBC World Service and U.S.",0
News & World Report but being better known for his ties to the Bosnian Serb government in the 1990s.,0
"In February 2011, he was denied access to Canada for having served as an unofficial spokesman for the Republika Srpska government in the 1990s and as adviser to Republika Srpska leader Biljana Plavsic, who was later convicted of war crimes for her role in the Bosnian War.",0
"Trifkovic is also known for having testified as part of the defense for another convicted war criminal, Milomir Stakic, in the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.",0
Stakic was charged with genocide and crimes against humanity in that trial.,0
Maxim Zmeyev / Reuters,0
An armed separatist guarding ballot boxes during Sunday’s vote in self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic.,0
Spanish Specter,0
"In contrast with the many observers with long, dramatic histories, there was one observer listed by the rebels themselves who could only be described as a ghost, with no record of him listed on the website of the company that purportedly sent him to monitor the elections.",0
"Felipe Delgado reportedly observed the vote on behalf of the Spanish public relations firm Mediasiete Corporation, according to Ukrainian news site Novy Region and Ukrainian journalist Anton Shekhovtsov.",0
"Oleg Bondarenko, a spokesman for the press center of Novorossia, the rebels' self-proclaimed sovereign nation, confirmed to The Moscow Times that Delgado had attended as an observer, along with another representative of Mediasiete Corporation, Renato Landeira.",0
"The participation of Mediasiete Corporation comes as no surprise, as the company earlier sent its president to observe the Crimean referendum in March. ",0
But no information could be found on Delgado or his professional duties on the company's website.,0
"Several phone calls to the company's offices went unanswered, and an e-mailed request for comment on Delgado and Landeira's participation in the elections went unanswered by print time.",0
A Moscow-based Spanish correspondent for Spain's Telecinco TV network said he had an equally difficult time finding any record of Delgado.,0
"I have been looking for information on him along with other Spanish journalists, but there is none at all,"" said Ricardo Marquina Montanana.",0
Unorthodox Approach,0
"The sparse information on Delgado's background sparked speculation as to whether or not he exists and highlights the murky nature of the election monitoring, with many of the confirmed observers openly saying they did not go through Ukrainian customs to get into the country.",0
"Instead, they traveled to Moscow first and entered Ukraine through its lengthy border with Russia, bypassing border control stations.",0
While the group of international observers hailed the elections as having been conducted in an atmosphere of joy and unity — citing the ubiquitous free food and folk music — Western journalists painted a different picture.,0
"U.S. journalist Christopher Miller wrote for the Mashable news agency that the polling stations were ""guarded by camouflaged gunmen … in what closely resembled an event straight out of the Soviet Union, except for the fact that votes could also be cast online.",0
"Fabrice Beaur confirmed his attendance at the elections on behalf of Michel's Eurasian Observatory of Democracy and Elections, as well as the participation of Piskorski's ECGA.",0
"He suggested that his group and the others represented at the elections — including the ASCE — were better than the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe, from which the ASCE appears to have gotten its name.",0
"Our participation is free,"" Beaur wrote in e-mailed comments to The Moscow Times.",0
"Unlike the OSCE,"" he said, the groups involved in monitoring the Donetsk and Luhansk elections didn't take any ""envelope,"" apparently a not so subtle suggestion that the OSCE takes bribes to issue its approval of elections.",0
"Beaur insisted that the election was fair, ""a real grassroots movement to say no to the junta of Kiev.",0
"The anti-fascist struggle is still relevant,"" he said, echoing claims made by the separatists in eastern Ukraine that the new authorities in Kiev were Nazis.",0
"While repeatedly leveling accusations of fascism, it was unclear how Beaur or the authorities in Donetsk and Luhansk have been able to reconcile themselves with the far-right leanings of most of the election observers present at Sunday's vote, at least one of whom is widely reported to have openly praised Nazi Germany throughout his career.",0
"Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s remarks and answers to media questions at the Primakov Readings International Forum, Moscow, June 30, 2017",0
"Colleagues, It is a great honour for me to address the second Primakov Readings International Forum, which has been organised by the Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMEMO).",1
"I welcome prominent researchers, statesmen, politicians and diplomats from Russia and other countries, who are attending this forum.",1
Combined intellectual efforts and an expert and depoliticised search for the best way to deal with the current problems in this complicated situation deserve our respect and support.,1
"The Foreign Ministry appreciates the Primakov Readings’ focus on dealing with current issues based on the experience of our famous predecessors, including the diverse heritage of Yevgeny Primakov.",1
"An outstanding statesman, diplomat, researcher and thinker, Mr Primakov has made a major contribution to the formulation of key provisions of Russia’s foreign policy doctrine, provisions that have passed the test of time.",1
"He also contributed to a comprehensive review of the complex processes underway in the post-bipolar world, which, as it turned out, do not fit the simplistic “end of history” logic.",1
Russia did its homework diligently in clearing up the Cold War debris and worked hard to build up confidence and mutual understanding in the Euro-Atlantic region and the rest of the world.,1
One of its biggest contributions was its decisive role in the reunification of Germany and the withdrawal of its troops from Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries.,1
"We did this with our cards on the table, without a hidden agenda or double standards.",1
It was largely thanks to the policy we pursued for the past 25 years that European countries have saved huge funds by redirecting their defence spending towards socioeconomic development and national prosperity.,1
"Regrettably, the world has not become more stable or predictable.",1
"We more than once pointed to the reasons for deterioration in the international situation, the frailty of the unipolar world concept, counterproductive unilateral actions and the risks entailed in undermining international law and the associated growth in the use of force in international affairs.",1
"It has become obvious that the liberal model of globalisation, which was developed in the early 1990s, primarily its economic element that is designed to secure leadership for a small group of countries at the expense of the rest of the world, has exhausted its potential.",1
"Despite the seemingly noble goals, this model turned out to be vulnerable to various challenges and incapable of dealing with numerous problems.",1
Additional opportunities that opened up for mankind in connection with the transition to a new industrial and technological level have failed to narrow the development gap between the rich and the poor countries.,1
It has in fact increased over the past several decades.,1
The world economy and world finances remain volatile.,1
Climate change is fraught with major risks.,1
"Poverty, social vulnerability and sharpening competition in virtually every area are promoting isolationism, protectionism, nationalism, extremism and uncontrolled migration.",1
"The reverse side of the “West-centric” globalisation model, the persistent desire to measure others by one’s own pseudo-liberal values, impose changes from the outside with no consideration for local traditions and even use force to remove undesirable regimes, has been a surge in international terrorism.",1
"In turn, nonstop bloody terrorist attacks in various parts of the world and the migration crisis that has hit Europe prove that attempts to build “individual islets of security,” sit it out in a “safe harbour” or address one’s own problems without relying on broad international cooperation are illusive.",1
The massive growth of cyber crime and the more frequent use of information and communications technologies to influence the socio-political and socio-economic situation and manipulate public opinion for the sake of narrow mercenary goals arouse special concern.,1
The propaganda of extremist ideas and recruitment of young people to international terrorist organisations in cyber space is no less dangerous.,1
"For years, Russia has persistently called for the adoption of universal rules for the responsible behaviour of states in cyber space under UN aegis.",1
We are expecting a response to our proposals.,1
"Evidently, in the foreseeable future, the world will continue facing a number of long-term problems of a truly pan-civilisational nature.",1
"President Vladimir Putin, addressing the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum not long ago, pointed out that we must not, have no right to, waste our efforts and time on squabbles, feuds and geopolitical games.",1
"What we need is wise and balanced approaches, without stakes on unilateral global domination and the vicious practice of “double standards.”",1
"Today, we are all participants of an objective process of forming a polycentric world order, which Yevgeny Primakov spoke and wrote a lot about.",1
His talent as a researcher and a genuinely systematic approach made it possible to focus on the most important thing and to grasp the meaning of tectonic shifts in the international arena.,1
Hardly anyone can dispute that this is a natural trend which has taken shape in the wake of the realignment of the global balance of power and the strengthening of the factor of cultural and civilisational identity in the modern world.,1
"It is in our common interest not to restrain this process, but to ensure its stability and predictability, and to make sure that the renewed world order ‒ cleaned on the basis of the UN Charter principles ‒ is fair and democratic, and globalisation plays a unifying role taking into account the interests of all the participants of international communication without exception, contributing to a stable and secure future for all humankind.",1
"The emergence of new confident centres of economic power and associated political influence implies a new higher level of mutual trust, which is impossible to achieve without observing such fundamental principles of international life as the sovereignty of states, non-interference in their internal affairs, and the resolution of disputes by peaceful means.",0
It is necessary to agree on a uniform interpretation of the principles and norms of international law.,1
"In this connection, it is difficult to overestimate the importance of the UN, which enjoys universal legitimacy.",1
Recent practice has shown that joint actions backed by the authority of the UN in the form of relevant Security Council resolutions can lead to significant progress in resolving the most complex issues.,0
The attempts to adapt the institutions dating back to the era of bipolar confrontation to realities of the 21 st century are doomed to failure.,1
"In particular, the North Atlantic Alliance has remained part of the Cold War paradigm as it tries to find a reason for existence.",0
"However, it was unable to provide a proper response to the growing main threat of modern times, which is terrorism.",1
"Furthermore, NATO has destablised and continues to destabilise the security structure in Europe.",1
"This, without doubt, is at odds with the aspirations of the peoples of Europe.",1
International relations have reached an important fork.,1
Our choice will determine the way the world will look 15-20 years from now.,1
"Either we will continue to waste our time and resources, which is fraught with a new arms race, further expansion of the space of instability, chaos, and uncontrollability, or the leading centres of civilisation will manage to reach an agreement and unite their efforts based on broad international partnership with the central coordinating role of the UN.",1
Russia is clearly in favour of the latter.,0
We are invariably open to working with everyone who shows willingness to effectively address key issues of global development.,1
This our approach – in favour of collective multilateral efforts to strengthen security and establish broad-based equitable mutually beneficial cooperation – is shared by most members of the international community.,1
"Russia will continue to act in this vein and promote a peaceful, positive and forward-looking agenda in international affairs, and also act as a counterbalancing factor and a guarantor of global stability.",0
"We will continue to build up cooperation with our partners in new associations such as the G20, BRICS, the SCO, the EAEU, and other associations in the CIS where there are no “leaders” or “followers,” and where decisions are made on the basis of a well-considered consensus with account taken of the interests of all the participants without exception.",1
"Relations between Russia and the United States have a special role in the world, because a great many international issues, from strategic stability to regional crises, cannot be settled without them.",0
"We are aware of many countries’ concern about the souring of relations between our countries, which have been made hostage to political infighting in the United States.",1
We hope that the upcoming meeting between President Putin and President Trump in Hamburg will clarify the matter concerning the future of Russian-US relations.,1
"Personally, I hope that pragmatism and the resolve to use realistic and effective methods to protect national interests will prevail.",1
"This is the approach that Henry Kissinger, an architect of the US foreign policy and a big friend of Yevgeny Primakov, has always used.",1
He is attending our forum today.,1
Caught in a Zeitnot,0
"Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to Ukraine to celebrate the anniversary of the christening of Kyiv Rus and Navy Day, showed that Russia’s President is concerned about the situation in Ukraine .",0
"There is little time left before the presidential election and the launch of the Eurasian Union in 2015, as well as the looming prospect of the Association Agreement with the EU in November, which adds pressure. ",0
"Some experts in Ukraine assume that Putin’s new stance is to reinforce ideological influence and keep Ukraine in the Russian World , even if he has to let go of Kyiv in terms of trade and economics.",0
His messages in Ukraine are indeed generously flavoured with rhetoric about “unbreakable” blood and spiritual bonds.,0
"He mentioned this at the Russian and Ukrainian Navy parade in Sevastopol, which he visited with Viktor Yanukovych, referring to the “strength of and devotion to the fundamentals of our predecessors who lived, worked and protected their common Motherland together for centuries and made it powerful, great and undefeated…",0
"We share common roots, culture and religion.",0
Our blood and spiritual bonds are unbreakable.” ,1
Similar messages were expressed during religious ceremonies.,1
"However, they are nothing new in the Russian rhetoric of the past few years.",1
"Putin’s speech at the Orthodox Slavic Values – the Foundation of Ukraine’s Civilization Choice Conference, organized by Viktor Medvedchuk, fueled diverse reactions from observers and experts.",0
"Notably, Putin only spoke to Yanukovych for 15 minutes, giving preference to Medvedchuk, the father of his goddaughter.",0
It appears that Putin was forced to stoop so low as Medvedchuk’s Ukrainian Choice because there is no other alternative in Ukraine today.,0
"The failure of various Russian blocks and movements, and the collapse of the Church Russian World led by Patriarch Kirill that has been more and more evident of late, have left Putin with significantly less space and time to maneuver.",0
"At the moment, he can only rely on the Communists who have zero prospects in Ukraine or the loyal Viktor Medvedchuk, a notorious Chief of Staff during the Kuchma presidency, and his Ukrainian Choice.",0
"No matter what, Putin is no longer content with Yanukovych as his vassal in the gubernia that should be part of the Eurasian Union, since the latter seems to have realized the danger of closer integration with the Kremlin for his “estate”.",0
"However, Yanukovych’s potential loss of power in 2015 is of even greater concern.",0
"The Family realizes that following the Russian model is its only chance to rapidly build a business empire that is equal to, or larger than that of its friend Akhmetov.",0
"Given the experience of the past three years, “Yanukovych’s Ukraine” is open to humanitarian expansion from the East, the inevitable russification of Ukraine’s cultural and media space, and the evolution of Ukraine’s socio-economic and socio-political models in line with the Russian mould.",0
"But it will not cede its own interests, which are completely focused on the rapid expansion of its business empire, something that would be an integral part of Ukraine’s integration into the Kremlin’s neo-imperial projects.",0
"Meanwhile, Putin has once again made it clear that he will not be content with just a loyal state – even a satellite.",0
"Instead, he seeks to completely eliminate the aftermaths of “the biggest geopolitical disaster of the 20 th century” – the collapse of the USSR and the emergence of an independent Ukraine.",0
"Only people like Viktor Medvedchuk who is considered to have pushed Kuchma to consent to integration in the Common Economic Space at the end of his presidency in 2003, can liquidate this “abnormality” “which is not even a state” (as Putin put it in a conversation with George W.Bush in Bucharest in 2008).",0
"So far, though, Medvedchuk seems to be too weak to affect 2015 developments in Ukraine, let alone seriously contribute to the disruption of the Association Agreement signing in November.",0
All this puts Moscow under time pressure.,0
"Indeed, the Association Agreement will not come into effect until ratified by all 28 EU member-states – and this could take years, especially if hampered by the Kremlin’s lobby in Europe.",0
"However, the DCFTA as the economic part of the Association Agreement will come into effect immediately after signing and will be able to block Ukraine’s integration in the Customs and Eurasian Unions.",0
"Therefore, there is every reason to expect a surprise or two from the Kremlin before the Vilnius Summit in November.",0
Similar things have occurred before when some events in foreign or internal policy threatened the Kremlin’s stability.,1
"For instance, a scandal similar to the alleged sale of Ukrainian Kolchuga ESM systems to Iraq that ruined Kuchma’s relations with the West at the dawn of Putin’s political career and his reintegration projects in the FSU.",0
"Or a new wave of mudslinging against the Ukrainian government, this time bigger in terms of media coverage and with a stronger focus on Western politicians in order to ultimately convince the EU of the criminal nature of the Yanukovych regime and that the Association Agreement should not be signed with Ukraine. ",0
"Meanwhile, projects like the Ukrainian Choice or media holdings created to spread the word on the Kremlin’s orders, are apparently created specifically for the 2015 presidential race.",0
"They are probably supposed to expand the pro-Russian electorate in Ukraine, stealing it mainly from the former electorate of the Party of Regions and Yanukovych.",0
"Ukrainian-Russian media are now fueling tension by presenting everything negatively, from the decisions and actions of the government, to social processes, trends and developments.",0
It’s possible that Putin is counting on a potential political vacuum in a number of southeastern regions that are currently under the total control of pro-Russian Regionaires.,0
"This is a likely scenario, if mass protests force Yanukovych to quit, as in the 2004 scenario, or if he loses the race to any of the pro-European opposition leaders.",0
Moscow already faced the huge risk of losing its influence over Ukraine for good in 2008 when the Ukrainian government applied for NATO’s Membership Action Plan .,0
"Apparently, it is preparing to respond to a similar threat after the 2015 election.",0
The risks for Ukraine in this situation are aggravated by the fact that the Yanukovych regime does not view it as a fully-fledged sovereign state and ignores national security.,0
"This is evident from the choice of appointments to law enforcement authorities and special services, where many generals who are openly pro-Russian, now serve.",0
"Therefore, it will hardly be likely to develop an effective strategy to resist the possible special operations of Ukraine’s “strategic partner” as the Vilnius Summit and the presidential election draw closer.",0
Ukraine as a state is only valuable to the Family if it maintains power.,0
This is why the regime will not develop any preventive measures for external scenarios that could hurt the country.,0
" It appears that Yanukovych still believes that the loss of power in 2004 was a coincidence, a lack of preparedness for extreme scenarios and the betrayal of Kuchma.",0
"Therefore, he may be confident of his ability to keep everything under control in 2015.",0
"For this reason, the government is instead developing preventive measures to internal threats, by trying to curb protest movements and appointing loyal people to offices which have a direct influence on the outcome of the presidential election.",0
"Meanwhile, it is turning a blind eye to external threats.",0
"It looks like Putin and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, including those inside the Party of Regions, are preparing to use Yanukovych’s limitations and shortsightedness for their own benefit. ",0
