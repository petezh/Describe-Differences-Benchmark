Hi Steve! The `instructions.txt` file includes a starting list of instructions for the user. It puts together all the piece outlined in the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lF1_vPVG2wfKW6-da4rdWTo9B_AnppYSn_EIpPcVMc/edit#). The `sentences` folder includes `.txt` files with example pairs of sentences. Some things to know about the latter:

1. It is currently limited to 5 from each distributions. I imagine that this will vary in the future, so it might be worth keeping that generalizable.
2. They come in both HTML-formatted (which highlights attention) and unformatted forms. Let me know if you would prefer just to have the raw alpha value for each span of words.
3. If there is relevant information, I left it at the top. These are guiding comments which tell them where the distributions come from, which should *not* be the basis of hypotheses.
4. Let me know anytime if there is a format for sentence pairs you would prefer over what we have (e.g. JSON). Happy to do whatever is easiest for you.
