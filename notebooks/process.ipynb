       "\"Background Information: First and foremost, I want to say I have been an avid reader of Erowid reports since I was a freshman in high school, and this is my first ever submission describing the hellish anguish I endured. Currently, I am 20 years old, a junior in college, and  attempting to write this report with as much vivid detail as my mind will recall.  I hope you don't mind that the story will most likely not be sequential and/or in chronological order. I would like to consider myself a very motivated individual, and somewhat academically inclined. A disclaimer: I have a tendency to be a bit narcissistic. I have experimented with a multitude of drugs, and have always had impulsive tendencies (my Id gets the best of me sometimes). Anyway, I always enjoy when the author lists the drugs he/she has tried. Thus far I have experimented with: Cannabis, alcohol, MDMA, MDA, benzos, opiates, DXM, LSD, Mushrooms, Nitrous Oxide, Adderall/amphetamines, Diphenhydramine, 2C-B, 2C-I, Salvia apiana, and a slew of other drugs that are not coming to mind. Back to the Story. I had recently gotten a new girlfriend who I will refer to as S (this is important later in the story). My notorious train-wreck of a trip occurred February 2nd, 2013. I know the exact date, because it conjures up images of hell, and was the first (and only) bad trip I had ever had. Anyways, my friends R, O, J, A, and M decided we wanted to get obliterated in the realm of what we thought was going to be LSD. I recall that we were waiting at our local Starbucks for hours trying to obtain some good ol' fashioned dose. Wrong. We collectively became extremely excitable when our sophomore friends said that they could get 'acid' from a friend of theirs. Fast forward an hour. There we were. At our local park  in a predominately white, somewhat affluent community (suburbs). I looked at R's palm as he unwrapped the tinfoil, and four tabs of white-paper 'acid' reflected off the street light (M had already had a tab for some reason). I don't know why, but I have a very distinct memory of M saying, 'Let's go to Neverland.' Readers, it is paramount to know that M was the ONLY one, with pure, high-quality Lysergic acid.  At this point in my life, I had mostly dabbled with psilocybin, and once or twice with dose. I didn't know any better when my whole face went numb from eating the tab. Guys, this was probably the most bitter substance I have ever consumed in my life. I recall A spitting his out on the street, well, because he was a bit hesitant of the psychedelic. His intuition proved him right. I knew something was wrong when I felt myself coming up within five minutes of ingestion. Ten minutes had passed and I was certainly losing my cognitive functions. I remember thinking to myself ,'Something will go wrong.' And it did. I remember thinking to myself ,'Something will go wrong.' And it did. As we walked around the park in an intoxicated stupor, we all practically lost the ability to effectively communicate by the thirty minute mark. If you have experienced telepathic communication in a trip (I had previously experienced this with mushrooms) then you will have a better comprehension of this abstract concept. At first, this realm was astonishing. I could feel my friends' energy, and felt hypersensitive to the sensations that encompassed me. The sound and light wavelengths started to become too much, but not unbearable. I still knew I had not come to my peak yet. As we walked to a nearby smoke area, R and I decided we wanted to smoke. This is hilarious, because all we had to do was look at the pipe, and then look back at each other and we knew we wanted to blaze. I remember M smoking a cigarette and saying the most outrageous comment. 'I don't know if I'm smoking this cigarette, or if this cigarette is smoking me.' I laughed pretty hard. Keep in mind he was on real acid, and was in what I perceived as the most collective demeanor he has ever exhibited. This was when everything went wrong. After smoking weed for a few minutes I started to become paranoid, and consumed by the hallucinations. My god. The hallucinations. After smoking weed for a few minutes I started to become paranoid, and consumed by the hallucinations. My god. The hallucinations. The were the most unreal experience I have ever witnessed in my life. They did not come close to resembling what I might experience with mushrooms or LSD. No, this felt artificial. Then my grip on reality loosened. As we were walking, I started to bump into things. This was probably the point when I mentally felt I had lost all control, and essentially went insane. I became frightened when my vision became so consumed by hallucinations I thought I was going blind. The streets had absolutely no continuity nor sense of geometry. It was a slew of chaos and this is when the trip became metaphysical. At the time, I was living at my dad's house and I kept envisioning in my distressed state that I had gone home in handcuffs a thousand times. I was delusional. It was almost as if my thought process was in a loop. A limbo where I felt I could not escape. I was in a lucid state where I was coming into and out of reality. A and R started to get worried about me. R and A were my best friends at the time (and still are) and they knew they had to take me to a calmer environment. In retrospect, I think what scared them the most was the fact that I was the most experience tripper and I was losing my shit. As we walked to the golf course, I felt a little bit better. The switch in environment definitely abated my paranoid state of mind. R comforted me and said, 'Dude text your girlfriend, you'll feel better.' 'Yeah, man and listen to some of this music with me!' J commented.This was the point when I knew that they had consumed less of the 25i than me ( I know it was 25i for a fact, keep reading). I put on the earphone'I am the egg man, they are the egg menI am the walrus, goo goo g'joob, ' These lyrics  fueled the fire for  mayhem. Apparently, this was the moment when we decided to walk back to the park.  This is when things got bad. I recall when we arrived at the park, we ran into some somewhat friends of ours that were being really loud at the park. They weren't tripping but were drinking and smoking weed. I kept visually seeing blue and red sirens and the voices of police officers in my head. The auditory hallucinations made me feel out of control. Wait, me, there was NO me. I had no identity. If any of you are sociology majors like me, then you will be familiar with classical theorists such as George Herbert Mead and Charles Horton Cooley. Cooley discusses an interesting concept called 'the looking-glass self.' Basically what this concept means is we look to others and see their reactions of us. We look at those reactions and internalize them as our actual selves. Trippy, I know. Mead also discusses the self, but in a symbolic interactionist fashion. He says there is no self and we develop our identity through interactions. Therefore, infants have no identity and just mimic the gestures that we exhibit. It's hard to wrap your mind around, I know. Psychology lovers will get this too. I talk about these guys because their theories were what I was experiencing. An Ego death. I had no identity. Andre did not exist. I wasn't even an organism. I was this thing, however, not connected to the world around me like mushrooms and LSD yielded. 'Get down! Put your hands on the ground!'*Whooooooppp' *police sirens*There were none. My friends were worried about me. I wasn't right in the head.They took me to their car trying to figure out what to do with me. R told me to text me my girlfriend  and the conversation went something like this:Me: HeyS: HeyMe: Hey R immediately grabbed my phone, and I was dumbfounded. I felt so out of control and incompetent. This is when the cops came. For real. The light shined in our car, as we were tripping balls. 'Get out of the car please. Line up over on the curb.Do you guys know why we were called here?''No,' I stammered. 'Well, we were called here because of a noise complaint.'The terror that became a reality finally started to dissipate. Four hours had probably passed and I was starting to come down. I consider myself and empathic person, and I analyzed the police officer's face. It was a Friday night at probably 11pm and they perceived us as losers almost. It's weird to say that, but that's what I felt. The expression on the officer's face was not open to interpretation. He was clearly viewing this situation as a waste of his time, tedious, coupled with 'you guys are losers' look. This is when I felt like a complete and utter moron. I said 'Thanks, officer' and shook his hand. I shook his hand! What an idiot. To this day I do not know what compelled me to do that but I did. They said to leave the park and that they would escort us out. uh-oh. You know what that means. R, O and J had to DRIVE their cars! Still very much hallucinating. However, we were in a situation where we had no other choice. The law told us to leave, so we did! I wasn't worried at that point because we were much more coherent. being in the car was actually pretty fun, but I was still shook up from the whole experience.  R didn't have trouble driving and I was anxious to go home. Please, never do 25i. I think it is one of the worst drugs possible and my sophomore friends told me that the dealer had dosed the tabs at 700 micrograms to 1 gram. This is cruel. On top of selling us fake acid, he overdosed them. So disturbing.Have safe, and let the spiritual energy take you, do not fight it! Accept your situation and acknowledge what you can do to better your self. Haha, self. I have always thought of myself as a good person, and impervious to bad trips, but it happened. Granted on 25i, but still. Be careful guys.Much Love. Sorry it wasn't as descriptive, first story ever. Peace.\""

During the days I was with the NAACP, I almost could bet you money on that, if they arrested a Negro, they were going to take him out on the outskirts of town somewhere first and beat him up, and then bring him back and throw him in jail. And hardly anybody ever was put in jail that came out without being beaten. And they always said they (cont) sometimes would have to tie their feet and hands and beat them down and all that to subdue them. But I never could understand how a man with his feet tied and his hands tied had to be knocked around They have stomped men in the jail that were accused of rape. They have taken men and women out on the outskirts of town and beat them\",\n",
       "  \"So I was the first volunteer secretary of the branch here. Well, we had some pretty strong cases, cases like the DiMarco-Bob White case. Most of the cases were rape cases where white people used to become dissatisfied and disgruntled about a thing. The best way they could do, some white woman would holler that she'd been raped by a Negro or ventured to rape, or something like that, and of course that meant a burned or lynched Negro. And so this happened down at Conroe. But we were able to get a lawyer - this was one of NAACP's first projects - and a lawyer that won that case in our favor. And the day of the trial when he was declared innocent and turned loose, they shot him right in the jail house, I mean right in the courthouse down in Conroe, that's in Montgomery County. Well, those things were so exciting to me, I did not know that people could be treated like people in Houston were being treated. Not only in cases like that, but in jail, prisoners generally, why, they would beat up people and anything they wanted to do and kill people. And NAACP then became the sole interest of mine\",\n",

       "  'There is the National Plan of Action. This has a few views on its implementation. There was a National Plan of Action in a meeting that this country held in Houston on women\\'s issues, after Mexico City. So to take it... The fifty-six state and territorial conventions forwarded the recommendations summarized in this, for amendment and ratification by two thousand delegates, apart from gender, the most diverse elected body ever assembled. Following each item, there is a summary assessment by the National Women\\'s Conference Committee of its status in March 1984. Now the National Women\\'s Conference Committee was a four-hundred-member committee, appointed by the president of the United States. I was one of them. So this formed an organization really, that met annually, all during the decade, on the national level as the United States women. So this is their summary of, taken alphabetically, arts and humanities, for example, \"equitable representation in management, government, and decision-making. For structures in libraries. and museums and media and higher education, blind judging whenever possible. Strides have been made in public awareness of the outstanding contributions by women in the arts and humanities. Funding and recognition, however, have not kept pace with women\\'s expectations. The National Endowment for the Arts, the Humanities have faced large cutbacks, severely limiting access and opportunity for all. Network and coalition activities have linked women in the arts and organizations.\" Now network was, when we got back from Copenhagen, that was the buzzword. It came out of that conference in Copenhagen. Networking, and women began to do it more with organizations, reaching outside themselves and outside their own organizations. \"Network and caucus in the humanities, and women\\'s studies programs have advanced women\\'s contributions. What had been an emerging focus on women in National Endowment for the Arts and in NEA programming has been curtailed, only because of the cutbacks since 1984.\" Then there was battered women, and organizations set up stations for battered women as a result of these women\\'s issues that came up. Then there was business support for women entrepreneurs through government-related activities and contracts, including of women-owned business and S.B.A. targeting. And that 1978 report, \"Unequal Business Enter- 73Ã¯Â»Â¿prise in America\" prompted training programs to assist women entrepreneurs, that has improved. Then \"child abuse, support for prevention and treatment of abused children, including training for public awareness and counseling, and service and justice agencies\"; we know that that has improved, public awareness. And \"child care, federally supported efforts and legislation at all levels to promote child care programs. Labor and business support in education and parenthood.\" Then minority women, recognition in every plan, \"recommendation applies fully for all minority women, with recognition of additional burdens through institutionalized bias and inadequate data. Enforcement of anti-discrimination laws as they affect education, housing, health, employment. Recognition of special needs of American Indian, Alaskan native women and Asian-Pacific American women, Hispanic women, Puerto Rican women and Black women,\" all of that has improved because it was brought to the attention through these national conferences, and that sort of thing. \"Offenders and older women, education, effective appointment to office, and credit, disabled women.\" all of those subjects have...rape, that sort of thing. \"Reproductive freedom and rural women, sexual preference, statistics and the welfare, poverty, continued committee of the conference, establishment of a body under public law\"; this organization was established under public law to consider steps to achieve recommendations of this conference, and to convene a second conference. So it started in \\'78, \\'79. \\'80. \\'81. \\'82. and in \\'83. we met in Detroit. Then the homemakers and the insurance and international affairs, media, and all of those subjects were out then, pointed up to and assessed as to the improvement. This is really the crux of the women\\'s movement after it moved away from the bra burning and those types of extreme things that existed at first among the women\\'s movement. So much so, that people didn\\'t want to be called a feminist, because it meant that to them. But the feminist movement and the women\\'s movement now, they have legitimate issues to discuss .',\n",

       "  'Can tell you what I know. And I can tell you how others felt. Marian Anderson, my friend, was not a race person. There were some of us who always lived above race. If anything was ever done because of my color, I don\\'t remember it. But I do know the facts and I\\'ll give them to you. These are facts from friends whom I know. There were within the race different colors of people and, because I knew some things that came to me from somewhere, that didn\\'t disturb me. If a person was very bright or he wasn\\'t so big and fat, you saw those persons on stage and you saw them on programs, even little children. The ones that were fat and ugly and dark -by some people they were not called upon. But the little light ones and the little pretty ones were. Now that was within the race. And it was true of grown people. But I hasten to say what I found out. When I found it out, I don\\'t know. As we were removed from slavery, you don\\'t find as many bright colored people as you saw 70, 80 years ago. All mothers during slavery who had bright children were not raped. They knew that if their children had a white father and if those children were light, they would have better advantages in the world. Many of the white men during slavery educated their children. Many of the women who had children by those white men were house servants. They had charge of that man\\'s house, all the cooking, all the cleaning. They even nursed the white woman\\'s babies. The white women were ladies. They did nothing but sit in the front room and dress and sleep. It was not until white women rose up against that, and told their men they would not allow them to accept these black women any more, that that was stopped. Now those of us who remember that are not as mad as perhaps those who think that all black women were raped. They were not. There are many bright colored people who were as close to their white parents as we are to our black ones. I am going to tell you about one, something that I know. I\\'ll name the place and the people who lived there would not object to it because they talked freely. When I taught at Snow Hill, Alabama, I had a friend, a young man, a friend in Dothan, Alabama, who was from Beatrice, Alabama. Beatrice, Alabama, is near Snow Hill. A friend in Snow Hill said she would take me to Longmire\\'s home. Longmire was then in Washington studying to be a lawyer. She says, \"I\\'ll take you to Longmire\\'s home. You can meet his people.\" She took us to Beatrice, Alabama. And we stayed in a home where there was a woman, a dark woman, and several bright men and women. We heard one fellow say, \"I\\'m going to get up and go to the big house and look after my father.\" This was as late as ...I taught at Snow Hill in 1924. And I asked, I said, \"Where did he say he\\'s going?\" They said, \"His father is white and lives in that big house up there.\" And his mother had every convenience that she could have, but they never married.',\n",

Obviously the daughter of a lot of raping in that family. And my mother was your complexion, and this was supposed to have been a cardinal sin, for a man of his complexion to marry a brown woman. And so the prejudice was very high against color in the South. The light-skinned people felt that they were superior to the black-skinned people, and this was taught to us, it was taught. Everything that happened in your life was to demean the original people, the African complexion. And the ones who was mixed with the white blood was better.

Mother had intended to be a lawyer, and one of the write-ups that we have of her with her picture in a book, is that she intended to be a lawyer...of course, she met Mr. Pitter and Mr. Pitter married her instead, and she was supposed to go ahead and be a lawyer, but I came along. This young fellow, for example, was accused of rape, and Mother went out into the area, and because of her color, and Mother had bright red hair and green eyes, and after typhoid, her hair was light brown. And so, Caucasians would not always know people who were black. She could go out as she could find out many things. She found out from the neighbors what type of people these parents of the girl were. She defended this young man and other young people as well to keep them out of prisons, because we didn\\'t have any juvenile homes in those days. And because of her they went to reformatories instead. I have been told that if I could have heard her in court, that she could defend as well as any lawyer. MMG: Do you remember about the time period for this rape case? CAT: Let\\'s see, this would have been in the mid-thirties, during high school. MMG: And this was carried in all the papers? CAT: In all the papers, yes. MMG: And what was the outcome of the case? CAT: The young boy was sent to reformatory school. There were others, too... not rape but, for example, a young fellow was picked up and he was six-foot five, or seven, something like that, for being a burglar, and Mother went down and proved how ridiculous the police were, after they described how the burglary was done, that a six-foot seven young man couldn\\'t possibly have been the burglar. She was always doing this sort of thing. When a young man, a Caucasian, was murdered and raped here in the city jail, the mayor asked Mother to please be on the committee to help to plan the juvenile court. She accepted and she helped to plan the court that we have now. MMG: About what time was that, do you know?... CAT: This would be in the mid-forties.',\n",

Everybody was writing about the woes of Africa, the problems they had, but nobody was mentioning the advancements that were being made. For instance, I attended some of the independence affairs like Congo or Zaire. I was there when their independence was announced, staying at the same hotel as Dr. Ralph Bunche. When I say we, I mean the photographer and myself- It was so calm and quiet right after the celebration that we went on to the Cameroons. A few days later, the Congolese were pointing guns at Dr. Bunche. When I got to Ghana, I was able to meet the first refugee plane coming out of the Congo. I was staying at the hotel where they took them. The same day they landed,Time magazine came out with an article on Congolese atrocities, such as raping nuns and murder. It did not happen. So much of the information was concocted in bars, where foreign correspondents sat around drinking and relying largely on rumors. They had to turn out something for their papers or they would be sent home. The same thing happened in the Mau-Mau affair. I was in Kenya when that was going on and of all the gory stories, less than a hundred whites were killed. But there were literally thousands of Africans who were murdered\",\n",

       "  'Speaker 2: Well, I think the cultural--academic cultural system determined it for me. Thing number one, when we went to medical school, there were seven women in our class, and some of the professors and some of my classmates wanted to die; their whole attitude was we were taking a space from men--from the veterans, and the--one professor told me one day, one, one time, \"You should not be in this school, you should be somewhere married.\" I said, \"I am married,\" (laughter). And he said, \"When did you get married?\" You know. But, but we--what was the question? I\\'m, I\\'m, I\\'m-- Speaker 1: Well, let\\'s talk a little bit about that. What was it like for you, as a woman, in medical school in the late \\'40s [1940s]? Speaker 2: It was, it was--our--most of our classmates were very supportive; we had a few that harassed us and said, you know, \"You shouldn\\'t be here and why are you here?\" I had one classmate--one classmate from New York; I got a Jewish classmate who asked me, \"Bette, why would a girl like you want to go to medical school?\" I said, \"Well, you know, I want to be a doctor, and the only way I can be a doctor is to go to medical school.\" And he says, \"Oh--oh.\" So that, that, that, that sums--that generally sums it up.',\n",
       "  'Speaker 1: And so how--while you were in medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], how were you determining which field of medicine you would go into?',\n",
       "  'Speaker 1: So, you were covering sit-ins and you called Percy Sutton and what happened? Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I called Percy Sutton to simply just ask him could I join and go down with the group, but he said, \"No we don\\'t want any coverage you know, you don\\'t need to go.\" So, I went of course. So, it was so ugly. It was so--the minute I got to this diner. It was a diner, this diner refused to serve blacks, so three men were behind the counter. \"Y\\'all can\\'t sit here, we don\\'t serve niggers.\" So, it, it, it\\'s, it\\'s still shakes you up. You, you hear about it, you read about, but every time it happens it shakes you up again and say I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing. I can\\'t believe this is now, this is today. I can\\'t believe this kind of hatred exists. All of this goes through your mind, but here it is these terrible people. They knew in advance, of course, that the, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] leaders are coming down there. They didn\\'t know a female reporter was going to be there, so I\\'m sitting there and I\\'m really frightened \\'cause I\\'m seeing maybe for the first time the worse kind of hatred and anger and, and possible killing. I\\'m seeing this vividly, vividly, just by the language, the way they insulted, the things they said and how they said, the men behind the counter of the diner, which was--to these NAACP leaders, who were trying to be served. They, of course, the leaders all anticipated this. This was all done on purpose. They wanted to be arrested. They indicated a little surprise at me being there. They--I was not known as an NAACP leader and it soon, and they soon realized that I was a reporter and so they said awful dirty things to me very loudly. And we\\'re all sitting there, these, these insults are going back and forth, but we are waiting for the police to arrive that\\'s why we\\'re just there to arrest all of us. That was, that\\'s the idea. Speaker 1: You included? Speaker 2: Yeah. Except when they came to arrest everybody, one of the policeman reminded another policeman that the law, I believe, he said says that when a woman is arrested she must be arrested by a woman cop, which may or may not be true. I\\'m inclined to believe it is, it was true because what advantage would it be for leaving me there. But, they arrested the men and I was left there with these terrible men behind the counter. I think there were five of them shouting insults to me that I cannot even repeat. I, I\\'ve never been that frightened in my life. I, I was, and, and I\\'m wondering if they\\'re gonna rape me, \\'cause that was suggested as part of the insults they were throwing at me. I said are these four men gonna rape me? Are they gonna kill me, or is, is this woman police person whose gonna arrest me is she really gonna come? And I prayed quietly. I didn\\'t, I, I just prayed quietly, and, and was so frightened wondering could I withstand what I thought was gonna happen to me, could I try to kill myself. It, it was not anger that I had it was just plain fear, just plain fear, the worse kind of fear. Story_ID: 372504 Speaker 1: The woman cop came sooner than I had expected, thank God. Her name was Ms. Kennedy [ph.], Officer Kennedy. She handcuffed me, took me to the car, took me to jail, and put me in there. In those--I, I, I don\\'t know if it was five minutes or ten minutes or fifteen minutes that I just, I just had to sit there and hear all these insults being hurl, hurled at me and wondering---I really, I really was wishing for a way I could kill myself because I was thinking the worse kind of things, but none of that happened. God intervened and going to jail was a piece of cake you know, it was heaven (laughter). And they, we had a trial the next day. Speaker 2: Did you have to stay overnight in jail? Speaker 1: Um-hm. Speaker 2: We\\'re you the only female? Speaker 1: Huh? Speaker 2: You were the only woman. Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: Were you-- Speaker 1: I just stood up all night in some little jail. Speaker 2: So you had a trial the next day, okay (simultaneous). Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because that whole thing was at night. I don\\'t think it was a long night. The sit-in had started at night, so I, I don\\'t think it was a long night. I do know I just stood, stood there and held onto the rails and had the trial the next day which lasted about five minutes and we were all found guilty and fined a hundred dollars each. Speaker 2: What was the paper\\'s [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] response? Speaker 1: Hm? Speaker 2: What was the newspaper\\'s response to your being arrested and fined one hundred dollars? Speaker 1: They just did a straight story on it. I didn\\'t want it dramatized or anything. I, I, with me I, I don\\'t, I don\\'t, I, I wanted, I didn\\'t get killed, I didn\\'t get raped, the worse did not happen. With me I thank God and we don\\'t need to dwell on my personal fears. That, that, that to me--and, and what I was thinking was, was that I didn\\'t want to sound like a cry-baby woman reporter, you know, you get it. Yeah, so, so I had a rough day, but you know it\\'s over.',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 1: And we were going to talk about because you, you, you carried, covered so many stories, you said you don't remember the details of them all, but there is one in particular that you really remember, and that's the one, the, the sit-ins, when the students were sitting in, and you had (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.

And that I found so stimulating, not at the time because at the time it seemed just like what you\\'re supposed to do, you know? I--only as I look back on it did I realize how remarkable and how wonderful a time that was. Speaker 1: It was a special moment for the theater on Broadway [theater district in New York]. Paul Robeson was there as we said Lena Horne, you know, and Canada Lee. And they took a leadership position. But consider for a moment what the times were like. We who had fought in World War II, fought with these expectations that the country was going to change its policy toward black folks. But when we got back home, we found that the country had no intention of changing its policy and went out of its way to let us know in many ways that that was not going to happen. There were certain cases where veterans were in serious trouble--young man, Isaac Woodard, down in [South] Carolina, you know, had his eyes gouged out while he was still in uniform on a bus [1946]. You know, two veterans in Monroe, Georgia, walking with their wives along a road in uniform, shot down by the Ku Klux Klan. A young man--Mapes (ph.), trying to vote in Georgia, you know, killed. And so the theater was always concerned about these things and as Ruby said, \"Every night somebody would suggest a party somewhere,\"--Rosalie Ingram, whose sons had killed a white man because the white man had molested her [1948], you know, and various other causes. Somebody being tried, somebody being lynched or somebody being put on the chain gang and we would meet to raise funds. Paul Robeson would be there and Orson Welles, and members of the theater. The theater took itself quite seriously.',\n",

       "  'Speaker 1: But back to why grandmother [maternal grandmother, Amy Hawkins Williams] disliked whites so badly--see, Pappy [Gray\\'s maternal great-grandfather], as I told you, she said he was jet black, but he had this coal black straight hair. And as far back as I can remember, my grandmother was, she was a little lighter skin than you and she had reddish brown hair. Now mama [Millie Williams Armstead] says that, as a child growing up, that grandma had hair hanging way down her back, long hair hanging down her back. But I don\\'t remember her in that manner--I remember her as a child when I was about nine or ten. She had short hair, very much like an Afro, and folk weren\\'t even wearing them back there then. And mama said she guessed it was a nervous condition--said her mother used to just pick at her hair all the time. I\\'m sure it was nerves, but grandma said that when she was a girl, fourteen years of age, said Mammy [maternal great-grandmother] came and got her. And I can think, as being her child, what I said to my grandmother, you know, children, as, as Art Linkletter used to say, children can say some of the darndest things. And what I said to her--she, she said, \"Mammy came and told me that I had to go in and bathe. And she was going to take me up to the master\\'s house and say--I said, \\'Whatcha taking me up there for, Mammy?\\'--say, she said, \\'Well, we will see when we get up there\\'--said, \\'but the master asked me to bring you up there.\\'\" And when the master--I mean, when Mammy carried her up there to, to the master\\'s house, he told Mammy, \"You just leave her and go on, and you come back in about an hour, and you get her.\" And grandma said--she didn\\'t call it rape then. She said all the things that he did to me, and said I\\'ve got--I had an uncle named Edgar [ph.], and he was just a pretty man. She said all the things that he did to me--said that old no-nation son of mine, but she would call him that, but he wasn\\'t responsible for who he was--Uncle Edgar, my mother\\'s oldest brother. She said that she referred to him as an old, no-nation child--said that he\\'s the result of what the old master did to me. And she hated white people--she couldn\\'t stand them. And she was just fourteen years of age. And then Mammy brought up Uncle Edgar. And when he was a little boy about six years of age, the master told her, told Mammy to, \"Bring that boy up there to my house, and he\\'s going to be my houseboy\"--well, it was his child, see. And so, the master just about reared Uncle Edgar up there in his house--bringing in wood and splitting wood, and that sort of thing. I don\\'t know whether they let Uncle Edgar to go to school or not because he didn\\'t stay with grandma and grandpa, my mother\\'s mother and father, but that\\'s, that was a story that she told me.',\n",

So as we rounded the corner going down the street downtown Decatur we saw this mob. And we were within the block where they were and they started shooting.

They knew the car and--because they had seen us when we came in. They ran back to the car, the whole mob, and shot in the car. The first bullet hit right here, this little side panel by my head.

I decided all of a sudden look up and there was nobody in front of me and I just shot off and found my way back to the church--little church where they had gathered. My husband by then was on his way back down there to try to look and see what was going on with me. But, but that\\'s the way that ended.

Because her husband used to drive all the way to Shreveport to get things for the hotel, you know, different things he needed. And so I asked him could I please go, and he said, \"Yeah, but you\\'ll have to ask Millie.\" Millie was her name, Mildred [ph.]. \"Ask Millie can you go.\" And I asked Millie could I go with him when he went out to get the stuff. And she says, \"Of course, if he\\'ll take you, sure.\" He took me. Well, I don\\'t need to tell you what happened there. But he also took advantage of me. Well, when I got to Shreveport, that\\'s all I wanted. So I got down and I ran away from him. He never saw me again. And I went to where the whores were, down in Froggy Bottom. Whores sat in windows looking beautiful, all made up. And people were going by looking at them, you know. They\\'d come down there just to look at the women. They were whores, prostitutes. But they were good to me. I could run errands for them, and they would give me a little money, enough money where I could get me a little room of my own.

Whenever I saw that light flash, it was the headlights, so I\\'d start hiding. When they\\'d get along there they\\'d see me, and I could have gotten raped. Anything could have happened to me, or I could have gotten bitten by a snake. But I prayed all the time that God would help me, and he did.

That\\'s a hundred questions and the registrar really didn\\'t know how to read and how to pronounce some of the words that were in the application--that was on the application. Then we talked to several attorneys and they said, \"Well, I have to take this and get the attorneys dictionary to know what some of these things are that he\\'s saying.\" And it, it was harassment, that\\'s all it was. Speaker 1: Well after you learned--oh I\\'m sorry, after you registered to vote, you were one of the few African Americans that was registered to vote at that time so you were able to vouch for people.

At that time, that they would also think, \"Well, she\\'s an easy mark.\" This is the male thought now, you know, in terms of young, attractive woman, and respectable men. They--you all--let me back up and talk, say it again. The men will look at young, attract--what they call attractive women, and they\\'re unfettered and free, and think that, \"Well, it won\\'t hurt for me to make a pass at her, or see how far this will go.\" Well, I had to deal with that like a young man would not have to do at that point. The female constituents of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] weren\\'t aggressive, and they weren\\'t reaching out to the young men in that sense, as it was. That was that duality of treatment. Still, the dual standard occurred there. And apparently, to them, I was a young attractive woman. So, I have been in some places, I awakened one night and to have a--I just happened--just woke up for some reason, and there standing over me was my host in the bedroom, in the guest bedroom. And well, anyway. So (laughter), and you had to be very careful, because you did not want to insult people or offend them, because then they would complain, find a reason to complain about the fact that the work of the NAACP wasn\\'t being done properly. And I\\'ve had branch presidents--like an idiot, one night out in Denver, Colorado, I went to let the man help me carry stuff from the meeting up to the hotel room. This is a long time ago, of course. I\\'m going back to my early days. And he came in to put the papers all--the garbage--the junk that we have left over from meetings, the important documents I should say. And, we deal in paper. So, the next thing I knew, he was chasing me around the hotel room (laughter). It caught me completely off guard. And he--now this one wasn\\'t an old man, either. And some of them were the older ones who had less inhibitions. But these are things that go with the job, that went with the job. And, so you had \\nhat in the \\'50s [1950s], and probably the early \\'60s [1960s] too. It was still not usual for a young woman to go freely and travel in these kinds of circumstances. So, it was an extraordinarily good education for me, but I had to learn to follow a line, so that we would still be friends, and I could still go to that dinner the next day, and sit there at the dais, on the dais with him next to me, and we were friends, and there was no animus between us, because that was the thing. The volunteers are our bosses. And, that was one ingredient which was on the debit side of the ledger.',\n",

You couldn't marry white, you couldn't marry each other. But it was that man who was spiritually connected to his mother who raised him, taught him his skills as a carpenter, cabinet maker, who loved and educated him. And I often, when I speak to young men of African ancestry, I said, to have children by women for whom you have no affection and have children that you do not expect to educate and nurture, that's not the African thing. The only person who did that was the slave owner. But black men raised the children born of the rape of their wives. And they did, many black men raised those mulatto children as their own.\",\n",

But I knew that there was always whispering and fear that Aunt Florence might get married. I didn\\'t know why that, I didn\\'t know why this fear was that she might get married. She was a teacher. It seems that there was one doctor, Dr. Martan, who would treat people of African ancestry, he would make home visits. So my, my aunt had this terrible stomach ache, just excruciating. And so my grandmother called Dr. Martan, and he came and he examined her. And he said, \"She has appendicitis. And she has to have surgery.\" My grandmother said, \"I can\\'t take her to the hospital,\" because they always--they knew by rumor what happened. And so he said, \"I tell you what you should do. You come to the hospital in the morning. You be there at 9:00 o\\'clock. Wait for me outside. Don\\'t go in until I come for you.\" Well, the next morning my grandmother took Aunt Florence to the hospital, of c\\nurse, to the back door of the hospital, waiting for Dr. Martan. And eventually this person came out and said Dr. Martan says come in. And my grandmother said, \"No. He told me to wait until he came for me.\" He said, \"Well, he\\'s scrubbing up, and he sent for me.\" So they went in. And they totally, gave her a total hysterectomy. Her stomach looked like a series of zippers. They mutilated her anatomy. When Dr. Martan came, he came outside and said to my grandmother, \"Where, where is, where is Florence?\" She said, \"They said, you said\"--he said, \"Oh, God, I just came.\" And when he went in, he told my grandmother what had happened. Story_ID: 12869 Speaker 1: And do you think Dr. Martan--now, was he, he was a white doctor, right? He was a white doctor. Speaker 2: Okay. Speaker 1: And--but the doctors knew that he was to operate. And they knew that my aunt who was a teenager was there for that. So they simply insisted that Dr. Martan had sent for them, and that was a lie. He had not even arrived at the hospital at that point. It ruined not only her life, but the life of the family because it was a disgrace to have had a hysterectomy. The thought was that you would never be attractive to a man, you would never be sensually expressive. And also about that time the strangest thing--and I\\'m, I\\'m writing about this, there was a Hollywood star called [Roscoe] \\'Fatty\\' Arbuckle. He raped a young woman, and in raping her, she had had a hysterectomy, and he penetrated the bladder. And she died. So, of course, this is not something that you talk about openly, but the thought was if you\\'ve had a hysterectomy, you can never have a normal sexual life because you will be ruptured. They didn\\'t know that a membrane grows, and, of course, they didn\\'t know that the doctors had prepared her inside so that the membrane would grow. They knew nothing about what had happened to her. But they were terrified that if she ever married, and had a sexual relationship, that she would die. And that was the reason for all this fear,',\n",

The father of the man was bothering her, making advances, and she wrote her sister up here who was working here in Huntington.

That's how we connected to South Africa because of the struggle. But, to go in the village where there's no electricity, no running water it was unbelievable that people live that way today, and then South Africa is a developed country. It's not an underdeveloped country, but everything is centered on the city. And the whites there, you got the true meaning of no middle class. You're either upper class or you were lower class.

REDMAN: Yeah, now let me ask about that because that&#039;s an interesting question because in many of these interviews where I talk to people about the Great Depression or the Second World War there&#039;s sort of this, sometimes people will have the notion of, there might have been this hush hush idea about what went on in the bedroom, but it was something that seems to have been gossiped about quite a bit in some of these unusual ways, so can you talk about how people in your family may have talked about what was going on with your uncle and his niece? They might have discussed it in some ways, but to you it was none of your business. BARQUIST: Well, their father, who has three other girls or four other girls, was furious, of course, and had he been capable I suppose he&#039;d have gone after his brother with a shotgun, but he didn&#039;t. That&#039;s one reason they went to California. REDMAN: To get away. BARQUIST: Yeah, they wanted to get clear away from both of their families because it was more of a clan than a family. REDMAN: I see. BARQUIST: Because there were, my great grandmother who had come from Pennsylvania with my great grandfather in a covered wagon, as I said, and the Conestoga wagon was still out under the trees when I was a child. REDMAN: Is that right? Okay. BARQUIST: They used to butcher their hogs on it, use it for a butchering platform. Yeah, they came and had thirteen, I think, certainly eleven living children. Now with a family like that you know there&#039;s going to be a lot of forth and backing, and I can tell you stories about that family from here to breakfast.',\n",

BULS: Well, I know that some of the draftsmen would make remarks to one of the very rather pretty stenographers, and she&#039;d come in and she&#039;d say, &quot;What in the world did he mean?&quot; And these were men who were making suggestive remarks to her. We had--the supervisor of these younger women was pro\\nably in her fifties, and she went out and--. If anything like this happened, she&#039;d go out and she&#039;d just read the riot act to whoever was responsible for it. Because she said, you know, &quot;There&#039;s no need for that.

REDMAN: Then at the end of the war there, sorry in 1946-- MADSEN: That&#039;s when I was closing the installation. See, because how that started out, Remington Rand, as I said, opened this new\\ninstallation for the World Food Administration, and then after a certain time they brought in a man to run it, and he&#039;d had a lot of experience in tabulating. So Mr. Ferguson came in and ran the installation, but there was a turnover because these girls would come from all over the country following their boyfriends or their husband until they shipped out or whatever. REDMAN: So in particular, to places like the Oakland Army Base or Treasure Island, or-- MADSEN: Yeah, so either they would--the girls that wanted steady jobs as soon as something came up, because we knew this was just a wartime job, so the girls that were looking but knew they had to work, they would leave and Remington Rand would help them find permanent work. So there was this turnover. Then these other girls, sometimes their husbands would come home. Then they&#039;d leave, then move. So it was constant turnover, and so then when it got nearer the end of the war, in &#039;45 I guess, early &#039;45, or somewhere maybe late &#039;44, my boss said to me, he said, &quot;Why, I&#039;m going to look for another job. This is going to give out.&quot; So he said, &quot;I&#039;ll train you, and you take over for me when I go.&quot; So we did that, and I gradually moved up. I had a government rating of a four at that time, and this person, Personnel Director, he didn&#039;t want me to get that. He wanted me to go no more than a five rating in the government. One man started with a twelve rating--the man had started with a nine rating--and he wanted me to do it for a five rating. I said, &quot;No way.&quot; So we fought for it, and both of my big bosses fought for it for me. I finally wound up with a seven rating. REDMAN: So it was a clear instance of sexism where-- MADSEN: You got a lot of it in that place. That&#039;s where you got the, I&#039;d say, not sexual harassment, but harassment. This person would just bedevil me all the time. REDMAN: This was one individual in particular? MADSEN: Yeah, yeah. REDMAN: So they would make nasty comments-- MADSEN: Of course, there was all kinds of skullduggery going on with the girls that I worked with. Husbands, boyfriends, and what have you.

It was the first concrete evidence that I had ever had, that if you believed in 34 people and gave them an opportunity, they would change, that they had it in them to change. Before that I had been thought of, at least around home, that I was too idealistic, that I was like Don Quixote fighting windmills, and so on. These girls at the Farm were taken off the streets in Norfolk and all over Virginia, but the Norfolk area was the one that I knew. They had been either five-and-ten-cent store girls or waitresses, and their pay was ridiculously low. And of course, especially as waitresses, they were exposed to sailors and everybody coming in who wanted to take advantage and have brief affairs. So a lot of these girls did. With some of them, it had happened in their own families. The uncle or their stepfather had raped these girls, and that had started them this way. Anyway, the situation was very terrible up there at the Virginia Reform School. They had a woman in charge who was unbelievable. She said that the girls were wicked; they should have no contact with each other, because all they could do was contaminate each other. So she didn\\'t allow them to talk, at least not visit with each other. They had work brigades, kitchen, barnyard. This \"reform school\" is at Bon Air, Virginia. It is still there, as far as I know.

Ransdall: Yes, I was alone. I wasn\\'t afraid. I\\'m not afraid of things like that. It never occured to me. I was just startled. I was surprised. After all, I knew they weren\\'t going to shoot me on the spot. They couldn\\'t get away with that! But it never occurred to me to be afraid. I was very sincere about this. I took this awfully seriously. One of these boys was thirteen years old and this seemed to me a terrible thing and there must be some reason. And these were southern gentlemen. They said \"We\\'re very surprised. We\\'d like to know what organization sent you down here. No respectable organization would send a white woman down to ask about a lot of niggers.\" That was their attitude, you see. That I wasn\\'t respectable. There was something wrong. I must be straight from Moscow or something like that. And they were puzzled because I didn\\'t look like somebody from Moscow. I didn\\'t act like I had a bomb in my pocket. I looked like a perfectly scaredno, I wasn\\'t scared. I looked like a harmless little school teacher. They used to think I was a school teacher.

And these were southern gentlemen protecting southern womanhood. These poor little girls were prostitutes, you know, and they hadn\\'t had any chance. They were textile workers. They lived in the Negro section of town. They had the most miserable kind of lives. They were harmless, as I was in a different kind of way. It wasn\\'t their fault that they had to try to make money. And they were caught on this train, you know, with these Negro boys and they all came from the same class. They didn\\'t have any particular antagonism except when the law enforcement officers got into it. That\\'s all you need to have lynched all of them right on the spot was to say two white girls were riding on a train with nine Negroes. Negroes. Why of course they were raped. That just stood to be. . . there was no question about it. It was just a matter of fact. That\\'s what those niggers did. That\\'s all they were interested in in life.

And what I didn't know is that no woman dared walk in that park, that they had been molested several times by hoodlums. And I was halfway around in the lonely part of the park, and right above on the hill I heard a tromping like a lot of horses coming down the hill. And here came a whole gang of young toughs. And one of them had a rope in his hands, and they stood across the path. And the one in the center, the ringleader, had this rope, and I turned around and looked at them and I knew I couldn't go further around the mountain because I would be shut off even more in a wild place. It was very early on a Sunday morning. M.C: Is it a mountainous park? Seeman: Well, Cincinnati is on hills, steep hills and wooded hills, and this park just wound around this wooded place too steep for any houses to be. And so I realized I wouldn't dare go further around in the wooded part, and I couldn't get back to the street because these toughs were right in my way. So I knew I couldn't run and I couldn't scream, and I've always been told that you must never, never show fear. So I took out my handkerchief, and I honked my nose in a very unromantic way . . . M.C.: [Laughter] Seeman: . . . as if I'm a very old lady and I have a very bad cold. Seeman - 56 And I walked slowly back. I turned directly, immediately, and walked back toward them. And they stood across my path, just waiting for me with this rope in their hand, and when I got within almost touching distance of this man with the rope I kept my eye on him and just looked at him seriously. And I just gave him a cold, scientific look. And at the last minute he suddenly turned and ran, and they all ran with him. They ran down the mountain like another troop of goats. And I walked on, and I realized that I had just saved myself by a miracle of not showing any fear, not showing cowardice or running or squealing or . . .\",\n",

       "  \"And the men in the rural area in those days didn't think that a woman got through the week unless she got a whipping and so my mother anointed many of them in the back where they were whipped and all that type of thing. And then she was fearless when it came to any situation. My father kept very good guns all the time. Once the family was with him in Arkansas and they fired into the home down there because they didn't want to work under him as a black foreman, but he always had guns. Ever since I have known him, he had good guns. And so, when we moved to the country, the whites would just walk up to a house and insult a black woman or tell her to come go with them and the husband couldn't do anything about it and all that kind of thing. They didn't come up to our house, unless they were way down in the field and they would keep hailing and hailing until they knew that you heard them. Then they would come up to the house. But they didn't trust my mother or my father with those guns. I'm very different. I don't touch a gun. And one of my brothers doesn't bother with guns, but the other one, the physician, he keeps his guns. I had a friend that died and had a very nice gun, I gave it to him. Because I wasn't going to use it. JACQUELYN HALL: What did your father say about the guns? You knew what they were for? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Well, he hunted a good bit. He never had a pistol, but he had a Winchester rifle, I think what they called a Sixteen Shooter, I know that it had a lot of cartridges in it. Then, he had a shotgun, a very fine one. JACQUELYN HALL: Did he use them to protect your mother, to protect you all from being MODJESKA SIMKINS: No, that was never said. That's what it was for if necessary. Because the night that that mob came to the house in Arkansas, one of them eventually was shot. I was quite a little girl, but I remember it just as though it happened last night. And when that one was struck, the crowd dispersed immediately. You don't have to hit but one of the fellows in a mob.\",\n",
       "  \"MODJESKA SIMKINS: I don't know, except that they realize, as the women in the old Interracial realized, that &#8230; you see, back there, when they first started that Interracial, it was not only against lynching, but fundamentally it was against the white men telling that lie all the time that they had to protect their women just as though the women didn't know when to say no and when to say yes. JACQUELYN HALL: And that came up in the meetings? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Yes, that was understood. That's one of the things, if you look back into the establishment of the old interracial movement here in Atlanta and some white women in other places &#8230; you see, white men always said that they were protecting white womanhood and they wanted to keep them pure. And they cloistered their women. Even in slavery, they would cloister their women, but they would go out and have babies by the slaves. And then, often these men in these prominent white families had their black paramours that their families knew about, because they didn't want to violate these young white women that were in those families. And even during slavery, some of the most beautiful black slaves, mulattos, were sold into the slave markets of New Orleans where they were bought to be mistresses of a number of sons of these masters. And of the masters themselves. And Thomas Jefferson had two or three daughters sold down there as slaves. JACQUELYN HALL: In the meetings of the Interracial Commission, did the white women talk about this situation? MODJESKA SIMKINS: No, it was known. They didn't talk about that. I don't remember that coming up, but I do know that when you look back into the history of it, that's what started it. They became incensed because the men were always talking about them just like they were helpless, you know, snivelings. And they knew that a lot of times, they were lying. And then, some of them felt that it was a reflection on their intelligence. And then, a number of them knew that their men were lying. Many times, when they did this and were going on like that, they realized that &#8230; although I never heard this said in a meeting, I've had it expressed to me otherwise, that a lot of this thing that men were talking about protecting them from black men was because they knew how they were violating black women and they just thought that the shoe would turn the other way. JACQUELYN HALL: Did you have that expressed to you in private conversations? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Just talking like we are now, or maybe two or three people together. And very often, as in the case that I told you about my grandfather, it was known by the whites around there that he was going with these black women. And at the same time, they wanted to kill a black man that went with a white woman. And although prior to, I think it was 1895, when Ben Tillman started &#8230; with Ben Tillman's regime in South Carolina, there was no Jim Crow on the trains. Blacks and whites went to dances together. I've had an old white woman tell me that she had been to dances many nights where Negroes were with whites. They would visit each other's homes out on the plantation like that during Reconstruction and after Reconstruction. And then, they brought in these Black Codes. They took back the government and then they put in all these laws and that created this particular thing that we have had to fight all these hundred years.\",\n",
       "  \"MODJESKA SIMKINS: No, I can't. I've often wished that I could remember that, because my mother &#8230; well, in the first place, my father was a mulatto. After freedom, his mother worked as a nursemaid in a white home there in Columbia. And she became pregnant by the father of this family and my father was a result of that union. And he never, although he should have, he never fully forgave his mother for that. The result was that my mother, who was the daughter-in-law, naturally, of his mother, she understood her better and my grandmother was devoted to my mother. My father never was abusive to her, but yet, he was cold. He was a man that had very high principles, clean-cut, honest, and very high principles. And he just, although the girl being a teen-ager was evidently the victim of circumstances, he never quite got over it. And so, although we were born in the city, my father early decided to take us into the &#8230; to buy some land on the outskirts of the city, which has now just about come into the city and is very valuable, you know, as the city has moved out. Because, at that time, he said that there was nothing for a young girl to do if she had to help the family out, except work as a nursemaid for white families. And he said that he wasn't going to have his daughters working in one of those homes. You see, that stayed with him. And so, he bought this farm land outside of Columbia and he said that he wanted his children to learn how to work and to know the value of a dollar, but he was not going to have them working in a white home. I've never thought that he hated whites, but this particular thing stayed in his mind.\",\n",

       "  \"JACQUELYN HALL: You can't remember that?\",\n",
       "  'MODJESKA SIMKINS: I can\\'t fully assess it. I could just say that I don\\'t think the South would be the same without what they did, because they opened the eyes of a number of people. The thing that the political power structure had against the organizations of that kind was the fear that they would bring the black and white mass together. And the power structure has always feared the combining of the forces of black and white masses. I can remember the first meeting of the Southern Negro Youth Congress I went to in Knoxville where there were miners, people in brogan shoes, overalls, just like they wear jeans around here now. The average person didn\\'t think of wearing them then unless they were going to the field or going to the mines. And those fellows came out there with brogans, and overalls, and sunhats, and all of them were working and planning together. Well, the first thing they did when they got a chance was to red smear and disrupt the movement. Now, I think if the Southern Negro Youth Congress, for instance, could have gone on, there would have been a very great change in the South because the younger people would have worked together better. But the power structure doesn\\'t want that. They don\\'t want poor whites and Negroes getting along together. There\\'s always been the effort, either obvious or subtle, on the part of the reigning element to keep the forces of blacks and whites apart. But they built it on the sex angle. They always say, \"They\\'ll rape your women. They want to marry your daughter.\" But they weren\\'t thinking about that. They didn\\'t care any more about a poor white than they did about a Negro. And they still don\\'t. They just give them a little more deference because he\\'s white like they are, but they don\\'t give a damn about a poor white. They\\'ll exploit him just like they will a Negro. I\\'ve seen it. I know what I\\'m talking about. So that was their affair. Why do they have to worry about Negro men and their women? If they hadn\\'t power enough to hold their women, if somebody could take their women from \\'em,, why, they ought to take \\'em. You see? Just like I hear people say sometimes if a woman can\\'t hold her husband why would she want to get mad with somebody else for taking him? She ought to be able to hold him, treat him right, give him good food, take care of him. You never find, for instance, as I heard an old preacher say once, you\\'ll never find a dog leaving home and going to stay at somebody else\\'s house if you\\'re treating that dog all right at your house. He\\'s not going anywhere else. Well, when you find the dog trotting over there every time you turn around, somebody\\'s throwing him a bone over there. He never gets a bone over here, just gets some dry bread and maybe a kick in the fanny, you know? [laughter] So, they use that sex thing. And they have used it as a social equality angle. They wanted to keep those forces apart, and they wanted to see that Negroes wouldn\\'t take your job. When the unions come in, they try to tell whites if you get a union, the Negroes will take your jobs. They\\'ll be making much as you make, or they\\'ll bring your salary down to theirs, and all that kind of stuff. It\\'s to divide the forces.',\n",

       "  'THELMA STEVENS: The afternoon before, late the afternoon before, somebody - I don\\'t know now, I don\\'t remember now who it was,- had come by the teacherage and had called the principal out. It was his house, their house, you see, that was the teacherage. The other teachers just had rooms rented in the house. And they called him out and said a little girl, that was maybe going home from school that afternoon, went on a trail through the woods. And when she got home she told her father that a black man, or surely a black \"boy\", you know, a black \"boy\" had followed her on the trail. That is, he had walked behind her, some distance behind her. He might not have been following her. After all, he didn\\'t molest her, didn\\'t touch her, and didn\\'t say anything to her. Well, the father got all upset. That\\'s what happened. I found that out later. But this was the tale that was going the night before. So what happened was that the father alerted all the men in the community, so they got a big posse out in the woods, and they finally found the so-called follower, the \"boy\", who had followed this little girl. And they just took him out the next morning, out on the hillside by the woods, hanged him to a limb and shot him to death. I mean, it was just as simple as that. That\\'s the kind of lynching that happened thousands of times, I\\'m sure. The courts, and the justice of a trial, just didn\\'t work.',\n",
       "  'THELMA STEVENS: In that same old house, yes. And we stayed there a year, until we had . . . became acquainted a little bit with the community and knew more about the population spread and where the needs were greatest. So then we thought they ought to buy a certain piece of property in a different location, nearer the heart of the community. And so they did, and built the buildings, one big two story building and a big gymnasium. And we had a small playground, and a little worker\\'s cottage where the white workers lived. And the Negro workers lived in the upstairs of the big building. My white co-worker, Dorothy Weber (from Lake Charles, Louisiana) and I were told that we could not live in the big building. Negroes and whites living together in those days would not be wise in the minds of people in the city and would destroy our chance to develop a community center. We moved into the little four-room cottage at the corner of the playground, but had our meals with our co-workers in the big building. We faced acres of cotton warehouses! Police patrolled the street in front of the cottage and banged on our door at all hours of the night \"to use the phone.\" We were far more frightened of the police than we were of the drunks who wandered around at night on the playground. In 1930 - 31 \"bootleg liquor\" was flowing freely \" the kind that drove people crazy. We were both very young and the strain of constant anxiety was too great. Finally, when a drunk tried to get in our bedroom window, we knew we had to move. The Negro community advised Dorothy and me to move for the community\\'s safety as well as our own. If we had been molested in any way, mob violence against Negroes would have broken loose. So we moved into an apartment upstairs in the residence of Mrs. Verdery, one of our Bethleham Center Board members. We had our Negro friends and some of the activity groupd come to our apartment as often as busy schedules permitted. We would (Portions of pages 46 and 47 have been omitted by Thelma Stevens.

They had accused this black of raping a woman, or something, one of those episodes, and they ran every black out of the county, took over their farms and whatever and they had to move. I was told stories about how they hung blacks around the courthouse. I know they at least lynched the guy that they were accusing of this, and I don\\'t know how many others. Some people maybe have done some research on it, but the stories were told. I could just see bodies hanging all around the courthouse in my mind as to what happened. So it was kind of a really [pause] horror. And then blacks coming in through the town on trucks to deliver stuff to the stores were afraid to get out of the truck. They would hide in the back of the truck. I found this to be just horrifying, but somehow I never quite got it connected with doing anything about it or thinking about it in that way. My father came home from the mail route one day, and he said he saw this old black man bicycling through town and he was on his way to Gainesville. And he said, \"I\\'m worried he\\'s got to go through Chestatee because that\\'s where the--.\" The young Chestatee boys were the ones that started the riot. They threw all the blacks out, the rowdy boys of Chestatee. He said, \"He\\'ll never make it to Gainesville,\" so he gets in his car and he said, \"I\\'m going to go find him.\" So he goes and picks him up and takes him to Gainesville and comes back, so there was that little bit of episode. Then this teacher comes to town--and I was telling that story when the storm hit--who had this black woman who was a companion, maid, person who\\'d always been in their family. And she taught music and the woman lived with her, and the boys from Chestatee came with torches and surrounded her house and made her get up in the middle of the night and take the black woman back to Alabama.',\n",
       "  \"MORROW: Medicaid, being federally funded, had to comply with any federal rules. And my recollection is that the federal funding for the abortion issue was in cases of rape or threatened life of the mother. One of my concerns here in North Carolina was not only rape and risk of life of the mother, but incest. I felt that as long as it was legally right for the wealthy women to have abortions, that it should be legally right for poor women to have abortions. Poor women who could afford another mouth to feed even less than the rich, and so I persuaded the legislature to appropriate some state funds for abortions so that--. For example, thirteen, fourteen-year-old girls who got pregnant, and sometimes it was incest in the family, and they had no business first of all in getting pregnant, but they didn't have control over it because its usually the male in the family who has control there. And secondly, they should not be forced to have a baby at that young age. So I thought we needed to have some state funds to abort these youngsters. And so the legislature, even though many of them were very opposed to abortion, they still felt that, you know--. They felt, I think, the same as I did, that to force a teenager to have a pregnancy and carry it through and have a baby that she was not able to take care of was not an appropriate thing to have happen. So our legislature, as I recall, appropriated two-hundred-thousand dollars in state funds for abortions for poor women, which would cover, of course, incest, rape, and risk of life of the mother, just as the federal government did, but it might cover some other situations where the pregnancy existed and was not needed nor wanted. It's a shame that we can't prevent unwanted pregnancies altogether, but the sex drive apparently is such a strong one for procreation that it alters behavior, especially if alcohol or any other kinds of drugs are involved. So I think it's much more desirable to prevent unwanted pregnancies than it is to have to deal with them after pregnancy has occurred.\",\n",

She has never had sex, is raped and kept as a sexual play thing, if you will, by the villain. Then the hero finds her, does not know.

But somewhere in there we were trying to figure out how to get to the community. And it turned out when we started doing that, the people who were most interested in having some connection with Brown were like faculty wives and other people who lived on the East Side. So out of that, I think, some of the administrators like Karen sort of worked on having, you know. a program for older women to return to Brown. And some of that involved, beginning to sort of do women's studies courses. But we did things like, I mean some people were involved in establishing a rape crisis center. But we als--I remember there was a big hearing at the, the statehouse, over abortion rights. And, you know, we never figured we would get very far with it because Rhode Island was such a Catholic state. But there was a committee that was hearing, you know, an abortion rights bill and a bunch of us went down and did testimony for it. And the room was completely crowded. And the issue was, was it going to get out of committee into the legislature, and I don't think it even did that.

And one of the things I'm trying to do in an article I'm going to write for feminist--sort of new feminist stuff going on in anthropology is about the relationship between women and social movements, because we came out of a social movement in the ˜70s. And the African-American women and the Latina women in anthropology that became feminist anthropology came out of social movements, out of the civil 48 rights movement, and out of the La Raza movement. And they all contributed to the diversification of feminist anthropology. But now you get--we get women who are studying other social movements. Some of which they're part of, like women are interested in migration and immigrant rights, doing feminist work on immigrant rights. Other women are working on food sustainability, issues about, you know, things that have come back up like rape, abuse against women, abortion rights still there. You know, that kind of stuff. And then a lot of women are in the LGBT movement, and working for marriage equality and so forth. So I've got students that have been working on those issues, people that are putting out some collections right now. So there's a whole stream of feminist anthropology where we've taken this idea that the personal is political, and [2:45:00] carried it into our research as being more, sort of, public anthropologists. Anthropologists who are working on critical social issues today, that are being pushed forward by new social movements. And understanding the relationship between these social movements and social change, and how you actually effect change, what mistakes social movements make, how they get anything done, where they get defeated, how they do confront people who have the opposite point of view, et cetera. So I think there's a way in which social movements have been very important to feminist anthropology, and continue to be in this kind of new way.\",\n",

And I just -- DB: So how did you survive those seven years? CCM: Well, I actually had a good time, but I didn\\'t retreat, which is what most of the women did, for--in some cases because they ended up with quite horrific family responsibilities that -- many of them did that from the very beginning. They felt very uncomfortable and very threatened by the male environment and the sexual attention. [You had a great deal of attention?] [35:00] from your male colleagues.

I mean, actually, these things are not difficult to manage, though I have been told recently, even by some of my active friends and colleagues, that it\\'s probably being southern that made it easier for me.

First of all, southern belles certainly are supposed to be indirect and covert in getting what they want. I\\'ve never been successful with that.

It used to make me very angry in high school when boys wanted to tell the dirty jokes, because I [36:00] couldn\\'t [stand them?] saying anything that I couldn\\'t hear as well. DB: Oh, goodness. (laughs) So the others [pulled back into some kind of shell?]? CCM: So the others just mostly pulled back into their shell and retreated the second year. The first year I was around, it was mostly just the Yale junior staff, which was a widely thriving 31 group of about 35 to 40 people, 10 of them hired in my year, and eight the next year, or something like that. Just an enormous bulge. The Yale faculty was never, I think, as large again as it was in \\'68, \\'69, or \\'68 to \\'70. The faculty always used that as their benchmark when they started talking about faculty cuts. DB: (laughs) Right. CCM: Everybody knows how to use statistics to their advantage.

And most of the time... I only once, actually, got sort of caught by surprise, much later than [my first few years?], and that was because I had simply -- I had never heard the rumor that this man (inaudible), and I thought he was asexual. DB: Ah, OK. Wouldn\\'t have been someone you would\\'ve expected to approach you. CCM: No, and he was not very subtle at all. I found that one disturbing, particularly because he was [38:00] just [chaired?] (inaudible) committee on women. DB: Oh... CCM: (laughter) DB: OK. Interesting choice. CCM: Certainly. He was. He had, and has, extremely difficult relations with women students, because he tends to, as he puts it, \"fall in love\" with them and then... DB: That\\'s not good.

And while there was a good deal of [39:00] sort of flirtatious behavior -- I guess that\\'s what it is -- in many cases it\\'s not really meant to be serious, and that\\'s, I think, why a lot of women couldn\\'t deal with it all. They could not distinguish what was not play, and not serious, or not serious unless you made certain kinds of responses. There might\\'ve been some invitation there, but you were certainly free -- DB: To not respond? CCM: --“ to keep it at a certain level, without it pushing past that level. And I will say, for my colleagues, with this one exception, that no single member of my department ever behaved badly. There might\\'ve been a couple who [had an idea?], but it didn\\'t ever...

       "  \"And one of the things that I did when I came to Chicago [Illinois] was to tape record my then 80-year-old aunt, my grandfather's sister [Esther], who was kind of the family historian. And sat down with her and taped her for about a week, and organized her pictures and that kind of thing. So she told the story in a very systematic way of our family. And one of the stories that had gone back through our family for years and years was how her father was run out of Montgomery, Alabama by a lynch mob. So we--she told it in a very organized way and as a result, I did some roots-type history and have traced back Jessie Chisholm Duke who is my great-grandfather. He was born in 1853, he was born to a slave woman and a father, I guess, 'cause he--his mother and father were Easter and Abner Duke, who were born around 1825, 1830. Easter was born of a slave woman and her master. So, and Esther says that this was the case so that our--we can basically trace back to about 1800, I guess, more or less, that side of the family. Easter and Abner Duke gave birth to three children, one of which was Jessie Chisolm Duke, who was born in 1853. He married Willie Evelyn Black, who was born in 1861, so both of them were born as slaves. Jessie Chisolm Duke was a--his mistress at one point, taught him how to read and write, so he learned how to read and write during slavery and worked that skill to his advantage. He was a mail clerk in Selma [Alabama], I guess during the time, let's see, during the Civil War. He was a teacher--I believe just after the Civil War, I'm sorry. He was a teacher and a mail clerk and at one point was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1884, I guess it was. Speaker 1: Was this in Alabama? Speaker 2: Well he was a national, this is national, but he was elected as an Alabama delegate. I think the convention was in Chicago [Illinois] actually. He came to Chicago to do that. Speaker 1: In 18--what was it? Speaker 2: It would have been 1884, I think. Story_ID: 85097 Speaker 1: And at that point he [Jessie Chisholm Duke] had married and had children. My grandfather was his first born. He had eventually eight children. He founded the Montgomery Alabama Herald, his newspaper. And the story that has gone through the family, even before I heard it systematically from Aunt Esther was that he wrote an editorial against lynching. There was a woman, a white woman who frequented the slaves, well the black neighborhoods, and was going around with a black guy and somebody saw her there and she called rape and accused this man who she had been--had consensual relationship with and they lynched him. They dragged him through the street and lynched him, and he took exception to that and wrote an editorial about that. And they came to his house looking for him. He hid in the piano, they couldn't find him. Speaker 2: Hid in the piano? Speaker 1: In the piano. Apparently they had a piano that was big enough for him to hide in. So they couldn't find him and then the mayor of the town who was fairly friendly helped him escape in women's clothes and drove him to the train station.\",\n",

       "  \"job you did on the Callaway show, da-da, da-da, we think it's terrific. So then, of our two senators, Paul Simon and Alan Dixon, Simon was very clear early, that he was going to oppose the Thomas nomination. Dixon equivocated and Dixon had a record of supporting certain Repub-, the President's nominations all during the Reagan years. But also, as a very conserve-, what we call a Reagan Democrat. I mean, he supported President Reagan more often that not on just about everything and yet had, you know, obviously maintained his position as senator for the whole state of Illinois. And I just thought that it was an error for him to support Thomas's nomination. So then there was one other television program that I did, and this one was with Susan Getzendanner, and Susan and I were now talking about the Thomas nomination. And following that, there was some beginning talk about if Dixon won't commit, you know, maybe we're going to have to run someone against him or threaten him or at least scare him a little bit. Lo and behold, Alan Dixon voted to confirm Clarence Thomas, even though the women in Illinois had been, you know, really anxious that he not do so and calling him right at his office. I'm skipping ahead actually because before that happened, the Thomas nomination happened in two parts. The first part was just on Clarence Thomas and on his record at the EEOC. And then there was a recess in the proceedings that went on for about two weeks. And, it was during that period that the Anita Hill revelations became known. And so then we had this whole period which Anita Hill was on television and the Senate hearings were being televised. People were looking at the Senate for the first time and not seeing anybody that looked like them, paying attention to the process, and the proceedings, and to the power that these guys had. Story_ID: 16731 Speaker 1: During that period, some people had started to say well you know, maybe you could think about just giving [Alan] Dixon a scare and saying you're gonna run against him if he votes for Clarence Thomas. I didn't, frankly, at that point, really take it all that seriously. It was just the thought that was kind of protest politics at that point. And then as Anita Hill's testimony went on, the women, as you know, became more and more enraged really about not just what had happened to her, not just the sexual harassment that she had experienced, but the fact that the members of the committee just didn't seem to get it that this was a major economic issue for women. And at the time, I remember having conversation after conversation that most professional women who have worked in the workplace had had some incident of sexual harassment. Everybody had a story of, you know, the boss who, you know, touched their breasts or their back or their legs or something, or who, you know, asked them out for dates or whatever. So this was something that resonated with women across the board. And the fact that there were no women in the Senate. Well, there were two at the time: we had Nancy Kassebaum on the Republican side, Barbara Mikulski on the Democratic side and that was really it. And so the fact that the Senate was 98 percent rich, white, and male, and that there was nobody reflecting the rest of America there who could even explain it to them, what was going on, really infuriated a lot of people. When the vote came, in spite of all the opportunities from the women in my state, Dixon voted to confirm Clarence Thomas. And it happened in kind of almost serendipity, again--. It happened that he did so on a Thursday, I think the vote was on a Thursday evening, we're checking this, either Thursday or Friday. But whatever happened, his office was closed for the next two days because of the hot weekend, and then there was the Columbus Day holiday. So he went either three or four days--I think it was either three or four days, it could have even been five, I think four is right--in which his phones weren't being answered at all. And you had women from all over Illinois calling to protest and their phone calls were not getting answered at all. So that just poured salt in the wound and exasperated the anger at the vote that he had made. And so at that point, I was still recorder of deeds and I got a\",\n",

Becau\\ne the first one is in the early months before January of 1991. And, again, we have to get the dates together on when [Clarence] Thomas was confirmed. But right after Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court my campaign kicked off. And it was a ragtag group. We had gone and just asked people to contribute ideas for my announcement speech. It was just really a fledging effort, is being kind. I don't know when Jesse Jackson's birthday is, but whatever month it was, I had gone out, just as I had gone to see Harold [Washington] about Lieutenant Governor, I went to see Jesse Jackson before I wanted to launch a political campaign, particularly as at that point in time, both Susan Getzandanner and Marge Benton were still looking at it. But the women of the National Organization for Women, NOW, had decided that I was going to be their candidate. In fact, the woman who was the president of NOW at the time had been my campaign manager when I ran for state rep; Sue Purrington is her name. And Sue had gone from being my campaign manager for the state legislature, now she was president of the National Organization for Women. Once NOW lined up behind my candidacy, that really kind of closed the door on the other two women who were looking at it.\",\n",

She scared the daylights out of (laughter) me. And so, she told me it could be one or two people. She said, \"You only been around two people, two males and so--,\" you know, I told her who it was, and then I just--that\\'s all I said, you know, I never told her anything about being molested since I was so little, you know, because I really feared for his life--I mean I thought he was gonna be in trouble anyway.

I guess he knew I hadn\\'t told the whole thing, you know, and so, he did for a while and--but I--you know I wouldn\\'t see him. But I, you know, I didn\\'t find out until years, years later that that\\'s what had been happening to me, you know, and I found that out and listening to Oprah Winfrey and finding out that it wasn\\'t my fault, you know, so I just didn\\'t like him anymore at all.

I said to him, I said, \"How will you explain to the folks downstairs how you got all those scratches on your face? \\'Cause I will hurt you.\" You know, sometimes I could be more bravado than there really is. But I was serious. But the point is that that happens. And some women can handle it and some can\\'t. I didn\\'t need a lawsuit. I didn\\'t need a newspaper story. I just needed this turkey to get it straight. That he was not gonna hurt me. \\'Cause I was gonna hurt him. But the sexism in the Urban League was rampant. When I was in the Washington Bureau [starting in 1991] one of the things that I did start talking about to our execs was sex harassment. And what that meant, and what that could mean to them. They used to make jokes. \"How you know how that feels? How do you describe sexism?\" I said, \"I--let\\'s put it this way. If that person next to you had done that or said that to your mother, how would you have felt? If it was wrong for your mother, then it\\'s wrong. If you can\\'t accept the explanation, put your mother, your wife or your daughter in the category. And if they--you would be offended if this happened to them, then it\\'s wrong.\" And then it was shortly after that, we had a male exec sued. Several male execs were sued subsequently.

But one of our female execs was sued for a sex harassment. And unfortunately I would say to them that, \"You know, it\\'s not what you\\'re doing, but it looks like you\\'re doing.\" And she would always take these nice young looking guys out for a drink after work. She thought that was nice. That was fun. \"Don\\'t do that lady. You\\'ve got to be careful. Don\\'t do that man. You\\'ve got to be careful.\" We had one person, his story hit the newspapers right after that. He was dating some woman on staff. And he didn\\'t show the night before because the wife had priority. And the woman had fixed his favorite food, which was spaghetti. She came the next morning with a pot of spaghetti and dumped it on his head. And that was the beginning. \\'Cause everybody called the press. The people that he was mad at on the staff, they called the press and told it.

Because I can still visualize it. And that was being molested in the housing project at a very young age. And that part of the book was very hard, because my sister asked me not to write it. And it was, you know, difficult in terms of having a stranger enter our house, you know, late at night. Because my mother worked at night. And, you know, we answered the doorbell because he said he was a friend of my mother's. And to be violated as a young child--I think I was either four or five and my sister was six. And it was very hard. Because even today as I talk about it, I can see myself, you know, in the situation. And then our fear in terms of telling our mother. Because we were scared to tell her we had let someone in the house. And we were just frightened because we knew of a young girl who was close to us in age who had been found murdered in the apartment and her body incinerated. So we were just really very, very frightened. And then my mother went into denial about it happening. Which was--and even as we got older when we talked, you know, she just did not--she did not want us to talk about it. Because it meant that something that she had done wrong. But I was very, very--in terms of something that remains with you. Speaker 1: Now you know, but I wasn't sure--you did not know? This was not a friend of your mother--Was it a friend or was--? Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No. Speaker 1: Or was it a? Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was a stranger. Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) A stranger. But he had said that to gain entry. Okay. Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right, right. He said that to gain entry. And probably just knowing my mother's patterns. And it wasn't clear if he had also violated other people or other young people in the neighborhood.\",\n",

       "  'Speaker 1: Now what was the biggest challenge I guess at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] when you were there? Speaker 2: The biggest challenge. I guess the biggest challenge was probably changing the image in that people thought basically as a black school and not necessarily as a very good educational institution. So, you know, there always would be little snippets in the papers. Little negatives about, you know, that would it occur at [College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia] that would never even hit the papers. But always if it was something related to Hampton, the negatives got in, and very few of the positives. You know if say somebody raped someone. Well even though the student might not have--or the person may not have ever graduated from Hampton, if they ever went there, in their lifetime, then, you know, it was mentioned as, \"Hampton somebody some--,\" you know. And so getting rid of the negatives related to the fact that this is a black institution and it\\'s mediocre. To the fact that it\\'s a great college education. It\\'s a great university education. Changing really the image. The papers now give the positive things that are happening. The entire perception of Hampton over the last twenty years has changed significantly. And I would say if you\\'re looking at HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] among the ones that have great reputations would be Hampton or Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] or Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]. Um-hmm. And Florida A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] too and some others. But those are the particular ones.',\n",

I think it was like five rooms. One night, I don't know the time but one night I heard all this noise out and I looked out the window and saw nothing but lamp, I mean, torches now I didn't see this but my mother and daddy talked about it later, they talked about it later after I had gotten into college and grown. When I tried--before I would ask what was this and they would not, never tell you because one thing they didn't want you to be afraid--those were some strong people. I was in college when I found out about this. That night, what had happen there was a black boy they were looking for--claimed to have molested a white girl and they came to the community. Now I'm talking about fifty or sixty Klansman and they had torches and they came knocking on doors and my daddy happened to go to the door in his pajamas or whatever he slept in. They brought him out on the porch and they surrounded him and they--men with shotguns and these torches asking him questions. They had him with his foot out looking at the bottom of his feet to see if he had been out. My mother went out there, stood in front of him and started screaming and yelling why are you doing this, who is this, what is this, my husband has been here with us, you are frightening me and my children, what is this and she would carry on boy. They finally said no let's leave him alone. I remember seeing those lights; I remember the noise, as I said vaguely. For years I asked my mother and daddy who was that, what was going on because I didn't know but they would never tell me until I got grown. My brother didn't even wake up. But they, that kind of thing they just never talked about. Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing you should never forget either. Speaker 2: Oh you don't. Believe it or not, really believe this or not when I started--when I get sick or something in the back of my mind I can just see that, I can see the lights. Do you understand what I mean?

And apparently, the Dixiecrats were running for office and so, immediately I got hit by this, you know, overwhelming white political power structure. Some blacks had started, I think, probably in the early 1950s running for office, but it was just a thing that people did with no hopes of winning. I think Dr. [Joseph E.] Walker had run for the school board and maybe somebody had run for public office of some kind and what not. But there, we became, my husband [HM Russell Sugarmon, Jr.] and I became very involved in the political campaign and then also in the struggle for civil rights. Immediately, we joined the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], starting going to meetings, the NAACP was being overhauled, it had very old non-progressive leadership. At the time we got to Memphis, which was 1956 a lot of northern educated young professional blacks were coming back to Memphis. There was Jesse Turner, who was the banker, who came from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]. There was A. W. Willis who came from Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan]. There was Russell Sugarmon, my husband who was from Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. There was me from Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts]. There was [HM] Maxine Smith who\\'d gotten a Master\\'s at Middlebury [College, Middlebury, Vermont]. Suddenly, there was Vasco Smith, who had gotten his doctor, D. D. degree. So, there were doctors and lawyers and people who, we were supported by the black community, you know; any time you have dentists, and doctors, teachers, nurses, whatever. Our financial support came from the black community, so we felt like we could afford to step out there, we ain\\'t had no money, but we had lots of umpf, lots of energy and we got involved in politics. Immediately, let\\'s see, Maxine and I had our babies. The next summer she and I applied to Memphis State University [later, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee], which had no, this is, this is 19--, let me see, I went there in 1956; this is 1957. The Supreme Court decision was 1954 [Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954)], this is three years later. She and I applied, oh it created a furor, ahh the people were really upset. Finally, they decided we were not qualified, (laughter) in spite of the fact that I finished Wellesley, she had a Master\\'s, she said, \"I didn\\'t even want to go there.\" It was just something that, you know, we had to do; so we were unqualified. In the meantime I was getting nightly calls from people who said they were on the football team and if I came out there, they were come and rape me. My husband and I lived on Lenow Alley [sic, Place, Memphis, Tennessee]. His parents lived on Walker [Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee] right across from the college [LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee] and his father, bless his sweet soul, built us a little one bedroom, tiny little house on their back property, which faced onto the alley. So, one night we woke up and there was a gunshot through the window, people fired onto the thing. So, we were not afraid for ourselves, but we sent our kids, I sent-\\'cause I had two babies at the time and we sent them, the little girl up to Saint Louis to stay with his sister for a good part of the summer cause we were afraid for the children. So, you know, there were threats and what not. But we kept on, we were completely fearless. Then, in 1959 Russell ran for the County Commission [Shelby County Board of Commissioners], and all of us were really active; I mean door-to-door, campaigning, up late at night, up early in the morning, speaking in churches, rallying, just, we really just became caught up. Now, in that race we really did think blacks had a chance to win. Unfortunately, he was defeated and the other two, one of them was [HM Benjamin] Benny Hooks, one of them was a minister, Reverend [Roy] Love and so the three of them were defeated. But, we were not discouraged, we were determined and I think people realized at that point that there was this movement which was now manifesting itself in different ways.

There were all kinds of issues with them when they spoke out with me, but change occurred somewhat. And there was education that occurred, and women tell me that their working conditions are there are better. We went undercover there to prove that this was going on, and that there was a hostile work environment. We went undercover at Ford Motor Company [in Chicago, Illinois] when the women there came to me to complain that they were being treated in a hostile way, and we found evidence of quite a hostile work environment. Lawsuits were filed. The women recovered money. You know, so again working conditions hopefully are better as a result of the work that we did.

Why is nothing happening to improve conditions there or close them down? That's my question--how can someone be seven months pregnant when the records show that the doctor was there every month to examine her? Where were the nurses\\nto check on her menstrual period? And who impregnated her? All a big mystery at this point, but I did the story, and then it was picked up by The Washington Post and nationwide because this is a story of the most vulnerable of us, and again she cannot speak, but I can.

Speaker 1: You did a positive thing. You uncovered it and possibly saved other people from this anguish and problems. Speaker 2: Well, look at the mother--the girl's mother who now has to think of raising a child, a baby, a child of rape. I mean there are just so many issues, and these issues are in our society, but this is a person who is very, very vulnerable and who was taken advantage of, who was raped.

Actually, three years ago, someone called me with a similar complaint of sexual abuse, but I couldn\\'t prove it. It never was proven, so I put it in my files, and when I got this call this time, I went straight to that file and I said, \"Now, this is call is pregnant. That\\'s real evidence.\" So the story I wasn\\'t able to do back then, now I can go and pick that up, and do it.

I feel that ministry to women is what my generation in particular--Vashti [HistoryMaker Bishop Vashti McKenzie], Cecelia Bryant [Cecelia Williams-Bryant]--I think we have been very, we have been the trailblazers. And I hate to say it, because I\\'m not tooting my horn. But we have been the ones who have helped women deal with their issues, their feelings. We\\'ve not been afraid to talk about it, and we\\'ve not been afraid to deal with it, to help women to express themselves and hear what they need to hear in order to overcome divorce, in order to overcome years of rape or incest. We\\'ve not been afraid to do that. And I think that that has helped. One of my things about women\\'s ministry and the ministry to children--I wanted to do a real strong prison ministry. And I brought a man in from the prison system, and I don\\'t remember his name. But he said, \"If you really want to do prison ministry, you need to start at school. If you really want to do prison ministry, you need to deal with women.\" He said, \"Because if you can have children in a safe and positive environment, and then if you can help heal their mothers, then you will impact the prison industry, and it is an industry.\" So, that stuck with me. And I do feel that in healing and ministering to women, I\\'m helping the children. And I, of course feel that the Allen Christian School [Queens, New York] is an environment in which children are steered toward positive living and toward college. And so I think that those are two critical, critical, areas that my generation, especially with the--you know, I\\'ve been having women\\'s conferences for twenty-seven years, for twenty-seven years, dealing with those kinds of issues; helping women to heal, helping women to be focused, helping them to see themselves as overcomers and victors. And every year I get feedback on Facebook, you know, \"Life changing, I\\'ll never be the same.\" And that\\'s what you want.',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 1: What do you think--I should have asked this earlier. But I'm just thinking, like what do you bring to the ministry and the other women in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church? What are you bringing to the ministry that wasn't there before in the A.M.E. church? Or maybe in general.\",\n",
       "  \"Story_ID: 174810 Speaker 1: Now, didn't, now, I think maybe, I'm thinking like how do you feel about--I think maybe in one area especially, black, the Women's Movement helped black women. Speaker 2: How? Speaker 1: Maybe I'm getting it wrong, but tell me if I am. Speaker 2: Where? Speaker 1: In the area of domestic violence. White women organized around that issue and--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Here's what happened-- Speaker 1: --and it filtered to us. Speaker 2: When the white Women's Movement began, lesbian women and women who had been real victims of men started joining the movement and really and truthfully, it was not even women who were real victims. I take that back. When lesbian women joined the movement, their issues of, and issues of child abuse came out. Before then, those wealthy, white women were looking at economics solely. Lesbian women joined, issues of gender discrimination really came up, but also issues of child abuse, molestation, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, domestic violence, rape. All those issues really began to surface, and you are right for many black, activist women, domestic violence came up as a big issue. Child sexual abuse, incest, all of those issues really came up, and, truthfully, it was the Women's Movement and the voice of lesbian women that created children's rights. We didn't have real children's rights back then, and that's when children's rights had--so if there, if there was a huge contribution then, of course, it was the fact that the rights of children was born as a result of that Women's Movement. But, you know, there are a lot of thinkers, especially thinkers of color and women thinkers of color, who believe that the Women's Movement and the white Women's Movement was a--was--what's the word I want to use? It circumvented the rest of the Civil Rights Movement because the Civil Rights Movement was really perceived as being a black movement for the most part. And in our community, black men were like lifted up. They got the jobs. They found their voic\\n. They found their place, short-lived, but, in fact, did. I believe had we been politically allowed to continue, even after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, if we had begun to continue to take that force and continue the work, we would have heard the voice of black women in a way we would have never have heard it. And it wouldn't have been just singular black women like [HM] Angela Davis. There were a number--C. Delores Tucker. There were a number of women but singular in their voice. I believe that we would have heard the collective voice. You'd have seen more sisters in the streets, not rioting but reclaiming our families and members of our families. We would have had a great voice, and I just think it was political. This is just my own exp- you know, sometimes I'm a conspiracy theorist. I just believe that our movement was circumvented by the white Women's Movement. I believe that. Speaker 1: Do you think it siphoned off energy from black women that they would have used had the issue still been civil rights? Speaker 2: I think it was a political maneuver. That's what I think because had the voice, collective voice of black women been allowed, politically, to rise up, we would have brought the other sisters of color with us, and it would not have become a white Women's Movement after that.\",\n",
       "  \"Story_ID: 174792 Speaker 1: You were saying before we came in--and we may have even discussed it the last time, that volunteer life eclipses sometimes the work life-- Speaker 2: Oh my goodness! Speaker 1: -- because of-- Speaker 2: Because that's where the passion was, that's where the call was. Although the work I did was also passion. I think by '85 [1985]--oh, I know, between '81 [1981] and '85 [1985], I worked for the Child Abuse Prevention Program [sic., Child Assault Prevention Project]. Sally Cooper was the director, CAP, that's right, Child Abuse Prevention. And actually, I found the job in the Call and Post. They were looking for a part-time writer to develop a curriculum for special needs kids on child abus\\n prevention. And they hired me because my--you know, I have a undergraduate degree from Norfolk State [College, later, Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] in special ed [special education] and a master's from Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] in learning disabilities and behavioral disorders. So it looked like I was good. Speaker 1: But you were hired basically as a publicist for them, I mean to write content (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: No, I actually wrote the curriculum. Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so you wrote, okay. Speaker 2: Yeah, I actually wrote the curriculum. Speaker 1: So you wrote a curriculum, okay. Speaker 2: Right, and then we tested it out on special needs kids and, what's the word--refined it. And then I think it was used around the country for quite some time.\",\n",
       "  'So the mayor sent Marie Hardy, no Marie Harden [ph.] and myself to represent the City of Columbus, Ohio at the End of the Decade World Conference for Women in Nairobi, Kenya. And it was absolutely the most mind-changing experience of my life. Twenty-two days in Africa--I had never been to Africa. This was my first time, and I felt like I was from Nairobi, Kenya. I felt like I had gone home. It was amazing. I did not feel foreign. I did not feel like I was a black woman going home, you know. I just felt like this is where I belonged. I met the most incredible women, market women, bank presidents. Story_ID: 174797 Speaker 1: We--and I don\\'t know how this all happened because you were kind of like on your own in Nairobi, Kenya, but I met a, like a media person--maybe somebody like Bradley, Bradley--what\\'s his first name? Speaker 2: Ed Bradley? Speaker 1: Ed Bradley, somebody like Ed Bradley in Nairobi, and he took tons of pictures of me and the women I was with [at the Third World Conference on Women]. And he got us into all kinds of receptions with the president, the president\\'s wife. We went to, oh, we went to many receptions that probably would have never gotten into \\'cause, you know, we were just women going to the conference. Speaker 2: Now, who was the president then (unclear)? Speaker 1: Oh, I do not remember. I don\\'t. Speaker 2: I\\'m trying to think of it myself and I can\\'t--I\\'m drawing a blank here. Speaker 1: But his wife was very active in the women\\'s community, and so it was just wonderful. Speaker 2: Now, was Wangari Maathai involved? Speaker 1: Yes, yes, but I didn\\'t know her then. You know, I was just, I was just awestruck. Speaker 2: Did you hear her speak or anything or did you (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, I did hear her speak, yes-- Speaker 2: --find out what she was doing? Speaker 1: --yes, knew what she was doing. Speaker 2: She organized women and just, you know. Speaker 1: Right, but this was, so this was in \\'85 [1985]. So, she was just early starting out. But one of the things that happened maybe that first four or five days, even if you couldn\\'t speak each other\\'s language--\\'cause there were like fifteen thousand women from around the world, I mean literally around the world. No matter where you were from, there were certain things about you being a woman that you could share with a woman from anywhere, from Bangladesh, from Sweden, from Canada, from a small village, from Ghana, I mean just everywhere, small island off the, off the coast of South America. No matter where you were from, it was like--it was like all the men of the world had gone some place, agreed how they were gonna treat women, and then went back home because no matter where this woman was from, we all had the same stories about childbirth. We all had the same menstruation stories. We had all the same horrible stories about how we were treated in every place. You know, women were raped in every place, they were beat up in every place; they, they, women talked about their stories of misogyny, they talked about their rights of passage stories that were awful, just--and then somehow this gloriousness of being a woman and finding your own voice, and your own sense of agency, and not wanting to lose that. It was, it was miraculous. I came back home, and I was, I was so fired up. And what I said to my friends is, \"When these--when I meet with these white women and we start talking about policy--\" because at that time in Columbus [Ohio], the white women were starting to galvanize around women\\'s health issues. And I was right there at the table, sometimes one of maybe two black women or sometimes the only black woman. And so one of the things that I said was-- Story_ID: 174798 Speaker 1: Okay, you said in Columbus [Ohio] white women were organizing around health issues (simultaneous). Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they were organizing around health issues. That, that was one of the really big issues in our state. And Judi Moseley, white woman, was working for the Ohio Department of Health and she was the director of women\\'s health for the State of Ohio. And so she was bringing women together just to talk about the disparity in women\\'s health and the kind of things we could do. Riverside [Methodist] Hospital [Columbus, Ohio] was beginning to conceptualize the Elizabeth Blackwell Center. And Elizabeth Blackwell was one of the first doctors either, I think in the country, first woman doctor in the country, but certainly here. And Annie Argo, whose husband was the founder of Argo and Lehne Jewelers was the chair of this women\\'s health initiative because she was gonna be the first director of the Elizabeth Blackwell Center at Riverside Hospital. So she was pulling all these women together. We were talking about health disparities, blah, blah, blah. So I was part of that already. So when I got back from Kenya [after attending the Third World Conference on Women], I was like, okay, I\\'m not being a member of anything unless I\\'m gonna be a policy member. I was very clear about that. I was not gonna be invited to be a token or anything. Now, I wasn\\'t, but, you know, I just--I came back militant, you know like, you know, I\\'m putting down exactly what my standards are gonna be and you know, what I\\'m gonna be doing, and they were like, okay, you know, whatever you want. We love you.',\n",

       "  \"Speaker 1: Harold Washington was elected here in Chicago in 1983. Did the atmosphere change any when Harold Washington was elected? Or did you see, did you notice any difference in-- Speaker 2: Not in terms of the crime rate or the police department. Because remember, the city of Chicago is one city within the County of Cook. And so, the State's Attorney represents the County of Cook. And so, you're talking about crime across... over a hundred municipalities. So, the State's Attorney was always very strict in terms of the way the State's Attorney's Office was laid out. Only the first chair in a courtroom--meaning the most senior State's Attorney in a courtroom--could determine the level of plea bargains in certain kinds of cases--crimes of violence, murder, rape, home invasion. That was when the law changed as well, to make it a Class X, so those crimes got greater penalties and no probation, which meant those cases had to be tried. So, that whole law and order mentality made for a more tense time, because you had cases that suddenly--where maybe you could have plea-bargained for something less than prison time--now automatically carried a prison sentence. So, unless the State's Attorney was willing to reduce the charge, you were going to be going to trial on these cases, because there was really no alternative. So, you didn't sense a change, in terms of the way the police or the State's Attorney dealt with crime. You simply saw under Harold Washington a greater awareness about how it was impacting minorities.\",\n",

But the Pullman Porters, right? They weren\\'t going to harm me. They weren\\'t going to rape or nothing like that. They were just on the train flirting with me but the Pullman Porters kept coming through. And it was very interesting because, again, this is an image in my mind and, \"How you doing?

And, of course, he\\'s very charismatic, and Rap didn\\'t back off with anything.

So it was off limits. But I think if I had to really describe, I would say that it was a safe neighborhood simply because everybody looked out for one another. The most horrible thing that I can remember during that time and, and, and which has caused me to have some feelings about rape and child abuse, is that when I was about eight or nine, I found a little girl crying on Fourth Street between some houses that had been sexually abused. And I picked her up. I did not know at the time what it was, I just thought she had fallen and hurt herself because she was crying. And I'm packing her around the corner to bring her to some of the women who, you know, lived there, cause they looked out--everybody looked out for everybody else's child. And it was many, many years later that I found out what had really happened to her because they quickly took her from me and, and, and took her to the doctor. We had a doctor that lived on Third Street, Dr. Wendell (oh.). And they took her, ran there and took her to him. And it was much, much later that I found out, you know what had happened.

But there was ample evidence that that it was not a rape but the fact was it was a black man involved with a white woman and it had to be nothing less than, than a rape. And so I remember when he was electrocuted for that. For me that, that was the first time I remember I understood the horror of segregation and Jim Crow.

I\\'ll just give you an example of the, the cruelty of the, the place, the shocking cruelty. There was, the, they have classification systems in prisons. And the classification system by type of crime, violent, those kinds of characteristics. The Georgia State Prison had a policy of placing the young inmates, the first offenders, in with the homosexuals, because they said they didn\\'t fight as hard as the older prisoners, and it was a way of pacifying the population. So I got, this is outrageous, I got a letter one time, an anonymous letter from someone who said there was a young inmate who had been viciously gang raped in the dormitory and that this inmate was writing to say couldn\\'t we help to try to get this kid out. So I called for the--an opportunity to meet this young man, and he came out, and he was not as big as I am, he looked like he didn\\'t shave yet, little young, in for car theft, first offender. He was obviously, mentally, completely out of it. I mean he couldn\\'t, he was having hallucinations because every time I talked to him he was doing this, looking around, he was hearing voices. I talked to him for about an hour, trying to get him to say anything. The only thing that he said, I said, \"If I could get you out of here, where would you want to go?\" And he finally said, \"Home.\" So I wrote on a yellow pad a temporary restraining order application, I served it on the warden, and then I appealed to him as a human being. I said, \"Look, you know, we can go and try to torture the judge into having a hearing, and, and do all this and get the lawyers involved.\" I said, \"But surely you don\\'t want a young man just to be viciously gang raped over and over again in your institution, under your own humanity. Won\\'t you please move him?\" And so they moved him, but listen to what happened. They moved him from the open ward, where he had been victimized, to the hospital floor, and they locked him in a cell so that nobody could get to him. Now this is inhumane for somebody who\\'s mentally deranged and, and needs help, but he\\'s at least protected from people being able to get to him, so I thought. I learned about a week later when I came back to the prison, that at night the inmate orderlies had the keys to the cells, and that they had victimized this young man while he was up there in the hospital floor for his own protection. Now to me--we later got him sent to a mental hospital. And I hope that they were able to do something to restore him to sanity. But to me, that is a classic example of the kind of vicious inhumanity and disregard for people. And any system that would treat young people that way, or have a classification system like that, is an abomination. Story_ID: 611913 Speaker 1: So when we hear things about prisons and conditions in them, it may be to say, well, there are a lot of bad guys, there are a lot of bad guys, I\\'ve met a lot of them. But there\\'s so much more than that that is at issue and at stake, and it\\'s--not only the treatment of individuals, it\\'s the kind of society we insist up on having and we\\'ve got to fight back and push back because look at, look at what this is doing to black people, the increasing numbers of women, the disproportionate impact on our young men. It\\'s, it\\'s a vicious, vicious system. So that\\'s one example of the kind of suffering that I saw. Here\\'s another minor example, because I had just, I\\'ve, unfortunately a mind full of these stories, which is a terrible thing to carry around in your head to remember them. But I went and talked to, because there was an outbreak of tuberculosis and so we had filed to try to force the prison [Georgia State Prison, Reidsville, Georgia] to test everybody to see did these inmates have tuberculosis. There was one very handsome, tall, young brother whose name was Eugene X [ph.], he was a Muslim, and he was found with tuberculosis. And he had been coughing and hacking, he looked so pitiful and frail when I first met him, and they did get him some treatment. A couple of weeks later, I was talking to another inmate and I said, \"Well, you know, at least they got Mr. Barber [ph.] some care for his tuberculosis, and everybody has been tested, and so I feel better about that.\" And he looked me in the eye, he said, \"What?\" He said, \"I was his cellmate for a year, they never tested me.\" So you see the indifference with which human beings lives and wellbeing.

You know, after years of doing prison and jail litigation I've talked to a lot of people under sentence of death, people who are in--serving life sentences, people who are in and out, people who have been raped, people who have had mental breakdowns, people who are dying, people who have been stabbed, people who have been beaten, people who have been put in solitary confinement, it--it's a vicious, vicious system. And I don't know how we think that those who do get out are not marked for life in ways that often make them worse than when they went in. I know we've given up as a society on rehabilitation as a goal, but the lack of education, the lack of rehabilitative services, means that the recidivism rate, which is about two-thirds will continue unabated. And it's a tragedy all the way around for those who will be victimized by criminals in the future, and for people who might have, given a chance, been able to turn their lives around.\",\n",

In terms of the inmate situation, women incarcerated has typically been associated with sexual abuse of these women in early life. Now, does it mean that more women are being sexually abused? I'm not sure, exactly. Are more women being abused in general? Again, I'm not quite sure about that, but there has certainly been a surge. It used to be when I talked to a teenager about selling drugs it was always a guy; not so any more. There are more and more women; girls are out here selling drugs, okay?

And so for many years I kept the secret and it was only after he was caught doing it to someone else and sent to reform school that I admitted that he had also molested me.

Now I'm not gonna say that, because I just believe in my heart she was a good person. And I guess just young, innocent and vulnerable. And I think she told the truth. But I think in a--in a--when he went from EEOC, I think, to a D.C. court and nothing ever came up, they didn't care. But then to become the [U.S.] Supreme Court person, that's when they cared, you know, 'cause there's too many other good black men out there that have nice clean background, you know. But he--I've been in Mexico at a conference and you'd always see him after midnight, you know how you stay up and party. Come on down there with the white women, dancing and carrying on, you know. He didn't have anything to do with us, you know. But he was respectful. He would speak and all of that, you know. But, other than that, you know. And he--I, I just didn't like him always talking about his, how poor he was and his sister was on welfare, and that was just demeaning to me, you know. Need to uplift her, you know. That was demeaning that he arrived and nobody else could make it out of the family. I think that was terrible. Speaker 1: So that's kind of contradictory to say your sister's on welfare and then not try to help her get off of it, if you're making that kind of-- Speaker 2: Yeah. My sister would've had a job if I were up there, you know, as a clerk-typist (laughter). So, but I, you know, other than that, I, I wasn't, I just wasn't close to him.\",\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I have to know that it's true. I doubt it. I just don't have that type of newspaper, now for this community. Now I do write about other communities, especially preachers, you know, the guy that was down there in Texas that went from nothing to multimillion dollars and was raping women in the church and all that. I, I--that was big time, I had to put that in there, that soap opera, had nothing else to read so I put it in my paper and it was good reading.\",\n",

But then under, I can't even think of his name. Speaker 1: Reagan? Speaker 2: Clarence [Clarence Thomas]. Oh okay, under Reagan they wanted to make it more difficult for black folks. So we had to do the one-on-one. You know, somebody comes in and filed a charge, sexual harassment, you just take her charge. Before we used to go in and investigate the whole, though everything and it might've been too much sometimes. But it was a one-on-one. Well you know if it's a one-on-one and you getting ten thousand charges, you never get through, there's no way. Because they don't give you the people, you know, to do the investigation. So just tremendous backlog.\",\n",

       "  \"Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I think--no, I don't think I knew how bad it was. Well, let me put it this way. I didn't know growing up as a child how--that everyone didn't live like this, okay. I knew that I had relatives that lived in other areas, but they were poor, too, and they lived in worse conditions. You know, they lived in apartment buildings where rats were running around. And I didn't want to spend the night because they had rats, or they had lice in the bed. So, certainly, where I lived was much better than where they were living. In terms of how other black people were living in the city, I had no clue as to where they were living or what their neighborhoods were like, because everyone I knew lived in a housing project. What I did know for sure is that, you know, I didn't like the violence. You know, I didn't like the fact that you had to protect yourself so much, and you had to be tough. And I didn't like the fact that there was so much sexual abuse and things like that, simply because, you know, people were vulnerable. I knew at an early age, I didn't like that. I knew at twelve and thirteen and fourteen, and certainly going into the teen years, that this is something that I would not want to bring my child--an environment that I would not want to bring my child up in. Now, on the other side of that, did my parents [Carrie Williams Duncan and Joseph Duncan] do their best to make sure that we were taken of? They certainly did. You know, we had Christmas and we had holidays, and we had, you know, the nicest things they could buy. We had full meals. We went to the parks, and we went to the lakefront, and we went to Riverview [Riverview Amusement Park, Chicago, Illinois] when it was open. And all of those things and experiences that they could give us, we had. So, we didn't know how bad off we were. I didn't know how bad off we were, and how poor we were, but I knew that we were poor.\",\n",
       "  'Speaker 1: Okay. So in terms of your own disposition, would you say that you--I mean did you know how bad this was then, when you were in it? Or did you have any idea? Or was it bad in retrospect (simultaneous)?',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: Well, I--I really loved that experience because we were able to--you could see the progress that we were able to make in terms of making improvements within city government. Moving those women into high-paying jobs, better positions, changing or starting programs that would enable them to get better jobs. Like I was saying with the [Chicago, Illinois] Fire Department--the fact that once we understood why the women couldn't pass the physical, then we had a program created with the University of Illinois [at Chicago] that actually trained those women in terms of developing their upper body strength and that was really fantastic to have the number of females. It was a large number that graduated because they came out of that program. The same thing when we worked with the [Chicago] police department. We wanted to make certain that more women would become lieutenants, maybe captains and working with the police department, we were able to be successful in having those women promoted. We were also able to look at what was happening in terms of sexual assault. We came up with programs there--what the first person--what the first policemen would do when he came to interview, or came to the aid of the rape victim. So we were able to put in some very good programs, and I feel--like I said it was a very rewarding experience and I'm happy that I was able to be a part of it.\",\n",

       "  \"Speaker 2: Well I have some stories Larry, and one that's was very impressive in my life and helped mold my life knowing certain histories. One was when my family sent two of their relatives to the north in caskets to save their lives from lynch mobs in the south and how they put them in caskets and bored holes in the caskets for them to get air and they shipped them out of the south to save their lives. And my grandfather got shot by white people in Mississippi when they were living in Mississippi and my grandfather died with the bullet shells still imbedded between his spine and the spleen because the doctors could not remove it. And how they would run from white masters and overseers and things in the south and how they would resist being beaten and how they resisted living in the south and having to jump off the sidewalks when white people would walk toward them. And how if they worked--one of my cousins worked in a white woman's house and she accused him of raping her and they had to take him one night and put him in a casket and sip--ship him to Chicago too. And how funeral directors down in the south would help them get them out of the town if they could to keep them from being killed. Those are some outstanding stories that I've never forgotten.\",\n",
       "  \"one cousin of mine was accused of raping this white woman. And he said that when he walked into her bedroom that she had all of her clothes off and she invited him to come up into the bedroom. When he walked into the bedroom and saw her stripped then he ran. And it didn't stop her. She still told her family that he had tried to rape her. So when he ran he hid in the woods, right outside of Sardis, Mississippi. And then they got into--somebody got in--he got in touch with someone and they got in touch with this funeral director and he set up the mechanism to ship him north in a casket. Another one, a man in a store in county seat of Mississippi told him that he would--did not talk to him correctly. They was supposed to say yes sir, yes ma'am and he just said yes and he said what else have you got to say nigga? And he said, I said yes. He said you're supposed to say yes sir. So then he sent a group of men out to his farm house to get him and they told him to come outside of the house. So they started shooting into the house and he ran out the back and ran through a thicket and ran along some bushes and things along the Mississippi River and got away. So it's how you talked to white people or if you--or even thought of as messing with a white woman you could get killed.\",\n",

They made their own little shacks, and these are all kids who are all runaways and surviving on the streets with dope dealers and murder and mayhem. And I also have another one called, let's see, I have seventeen all total. Oh, 'To Protect and Serve' which is about a young woman who was picked up by the police and brutally violated and gang-raped, and then the cover-up that was done, and how they threatened her and harassed her family and her children.

You know you go to talk to a corporate person about raising money for those kinds of programs, and they don't want to admit that exists. They wanna think of happy smiley faces in children and sometimes you talk about daycare and you talking to people who say you know I go to work every day and I pay for my own day care. So, you start talking about subsidized day care. Well people go to work they need to pay for their own day care, why would I subsidize that. So, when you talk about eliminating racism people don't want to talk about racism. They say we get along fine, we don't need to have talks about that, so the fund raising challenge or running the YWCA when you're not running a gym and swim program and there's something that somebody can feel good about and say, I'm taking twenty little poor kids of projects and teaching them how to swim and their playing basketball and they all look happy, when you're talking about those issues that nobody wants to talk about--they're not sexy hot issues; it's difficult, so\",\n",

Story_ID: 179781 Speaker 1: Now the Harris Y [Harriet M.

       "  'YWCA has been a pro-choice organization for the last 30 years. A lot of people don\\'t know what. So, they said, you know, how could you be a pro-choice, you know, how could you be a baby killer. I got calls in the middle of the night calling me a lesbian baby killer, 4 o\\'clock in the morning phone calls. So, once they got themselves organized and put it out there on the internet it had an incredible ripple effect for us. I got five, we kept track of them, 5,088 emails, but really I got about fifty because a lot of them were the same form letter saying the same thing and so that the Christian right is very organized and we ever get as organized as they are and we learn how to get out to our constituents we believe in the elimination of racism and economic empowerment of women and get them to attack the way they did us, we would be light years ahead. Story_ID: 179788 Speaker 1: I often wonder why organizations don\\'t do that or maybe is that, you know when you really look at it is it a really good use of time to organize people to write form letters and send them in to Pat Robinson or somebody to tell them to knock or off or somebody like a Rush Limbaugh or somebody, I mean (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: Well, they\\'re effective in the since that they affect our funders. For instance, the YWCA in Nashville [Tennessee] lost $700,000 dollars as a result of this campaign because, you know, it\\'s the South and they\\'re a little more conservative and the tone of the letter, I mean, you know, then you get in a defensive position where you\\'re saying this is what we\\'re not rather than this is what we are and so you\\'re constantly saying and, and we have such a wide tent. We have some people--like I was on a radio show for instance in Alaska where a guy asked me did I believe in abortion and it was over this issue and I said to him well let\\'s presume, I\\'m a Catholic, so I don\\'t believe in abortions for myself, but if my daughter got pregnant as a result of a rape I would have to reevaluate my position on abortion and his response to me was, \"Oh come on Ms., come on you know that nobody gets pregnant the first time they get raped.\" So, I said to him how many times does somebody have to get raped before they get pregnant? Well, you know what I mean we\\'re going to commercial, so he went to commercial and then he came back and said, \"This is really going to be rough,\" and his callers started calling me and saying how did we call ourselves a Christian organization and, and I told you earlier when I was a kid I went to Bible school and one of the things we had to do in Bible school is learn the Bible verse for every letter in the alphabet. So, I think he met his match because I said to him sir all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, and he was floored. He just--(unclear)--(laughing) and didn\\'t know what to do and then he was clambering on and on and I said to him be still the Lord is in this holy temple. So, then I started running down my ABC\\'s about judging, not lest ye be judged, and finally he hung up and he said, \"All right well we\\'re just gonna have to agree to disagree, God bless you,\" (laughing) and I thought all that Bible school training came in handy. But, it\\'s that right wing, you know, they are, they\\'re very organized and they can affect your funding. You know, we got a lot of letters from people saying I\\'m never gonna give the YWCA another dime and please take my name out of your records and then we had a little press release that said ask them what is their name so we can take their name out, and they would hang up because they weren\\'t contributing to us anyway, anyway.',\n",
       "  \": And for me one of my crowning achievements is the YWCA has, has something called the Leader Luncheon, which is an event. When I came, was raising $200,000 a year and when I left we were raising $700,000 a year, and it's a luncheon that recognizes women in, in their field for excellence and it's in like education, the business world, non-for-profit, community service. That's a major thing, so that we've recognized women of achievement. It's called the Women of Achievement luncheon, Leader Luncheon. For twenty-eight years that's been going on. So, most of the women who are the movers and shakers in this city have been recognized. After I came, I said if we couldn't and we were recognizing women in education, business, and I said well how come we're not recognizing women who are doing work in racial justice because there are very few people doing this. So, why don't we give a racial justice award and give this award to a woman who is doing outstanding work to improve race relations in the city. And, if, if we come in a kind of occasion where we can't find a woman who's doing it, we won't give the award and that will say a lot to the community about what's happening in the way of race relations. And so we've given the award to Julia Stasch, you know who became the mayors', working in the mayor's office, but at the time she worked for Richie [Richard] Stein because that, Richie Stein was a large developer in Chicago who Julia was his top woman and she made sure that women and minorities were including on all the construction projects, so she really did a good job. We gave it to a little Jewish woman named Marian Epps who, Miriam Epps [ph.] who lived in South Shore and worked really hard to keep South Shore an integrated community and worked with the National Council of Christians and Jews. And we gave it to the woman who used to head up the Community Renewal Society. I can't remember her name. She was very active in Trinity Church. She's a minister. We gave it to [JM] Willie Barrow one year. And we've only given the award--we gave it to Lucretia Bailey who works for the Urban Affairs Institute. And then we gave it to two doctors. One's black woman doctor and a white woman doctor who worked on events to bring children together and its kind--it, it was children of violence. It was taking children out of violence and they're both doctors. One worked on the girl X. Remember the girl X who was-- Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: --and the other one worked on that-- Speaker 2: The girl X was just for those wa, watching this she was attacked with some chemicals or something. She was raped and then, then-- Speaker 1: In Cabrini Green. Yeah she was raped and attacked with chemicals in Cabrini Green-- Speaker 2: Right, right. Speaker 1: --left for dead and is blind now, can't talk, etc. And this doctor was the doctor who worked--both of them were from the Rehab Institute\",\n",
       "  \"Speaker 1: Now the Harris Y [Harriet M. Harris YWCA], we were just talking about the importance of the Harris Y on the South Side for the cultural life of this city, you know, not to mention the programs that you discussed the child care, sexual assault program all those things going on at the Harris Y. Speaker 2: The Harris Y was a major player in the community, and if, if you look at the money that was built, that was given to raise that, the money that was raised to build the Harris YWCA a lot of people like [HM] John Johnson and if you look at the old list of contributors a lot of money was raised from black people on the south side of Chicago [Illinois] that put that building up. And you know R. G. Johnson that used to be the old superintendent of schools well her daughter-in-law was the first director of Harris, and she ran that YWCA and had the community involved. There was a lot going on and when I came there in '87 [1987] JoAnne Evans was the director, and she was continuing to get involved, and as you said [HM] Abena Brown had all of her things there and she was the program director for the YW.\",\n",

Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: That was a challenge. That was a challenge. The other challenge was in terms of getting a board people who were people of substance because again the YWCA is a women's organization, and we don't have men on board. We have men, women, and so- Speaker 1: Is it, is it by, by design or no, no, no-- Speaker 2: By design. It provides women an opportunity for leadership, so that's one of our goals to empower and, and, and train women for leadership. So, we never have the top people in the corporation on the board.

We ran the rape hotline. We had rape counseling. I had trained people who could respond to, to women who had been raped, so it was a major deal. I did some testimony before [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun when she was a state legislator, she and Monica Faith Stewart [HistoryMaker Monica Stewart]. So it was a--you know, it was a--it was--for me, it was a, a window to do good as well as it, it satisfied my need to, to, to deal with justice, and so that was--I was--I was very excited about being able to, to do that. Unfortunately, the funding ran out. And when we tried to raise money locally from places like United Way [United Way Worldwide], things were said--I made some--I look back. I almost--I, I have to laugh and look back on what was okay to say then, questions like, well if this is so important, why isn't the, the broader women's community embracing it? Or why isn't the women's community embracing it, assuming that black women are not--you know, it was just--you know-- Speaker 2: Now, this is interesting.

I mean, we have so few, we want them to be perfect. But, you know what? No one's perfect. And, and, when I say that this is not--I'm not making a judgment about, you know, whether or no\\n I was in favor of Clarence Thomas, which I was not. But, you know, I'm really not even making that judgment-- Speaker 1: Right. Speaker 2: I'm just saying that-- Speaker 1: And, that not, yeah, I'm not asking you to. Speaker 2: That it's just, you want the, yeah, you want someone to be--you want it to be perfect, and it isn't. And, so, it was embarrassing. And, but, it brought up a lot of other issues. That again, you know, it's interesting, whenever you try to sweep these issues under the rug, they always have a way of coming out at the worst possible time. And, so, again, you know-- Speaker 1: What issues came out of that, they say? Speaker 2: Well, you know, the--you know, sexism, you know. Sexual harassment in the workplace. These were all issues that, you know--and, and they dealt with it by trying to discredit, you know, Anita Hill. As if, you know, she was trying to sabotage America or something like that, you know. I mean, yeah, she was sabotaging somebody's agenda, you know. Yeah, but, I don't know, I just don't know. I don't think it was proven that this was some sort of put up job that, you know, that someone put her up to it so that this, so that he would be discredited so that he wouldn't be confirmed. But, I don't think that that's ever been established that that was so. I mean, so she just, you know, as a matter of her conscious, spoke out. And, I think it took a, it was a--and I think it took an incredible act of courage for her to do it. And, there was nothing in it for her. And, look what happened to her. I mean, she seems she's fine-- Speaker 1: What happened to her? Speaker 2: Well, she, she, she's--I mean, first of all, she was subject to a great deal of sort of public abuse, scrutiny, unprecedented scrutiny of her personal life. Untru- you know, lies were told about her. And, and, she--I mean, ultimately she went back and someone, you know, ineffective (laughter), degree and I guess, I don't know, you know. And, and she's teaching and she seems to be fine. But, I mean, to have had to, to say--and, she had to know, she had to know once she did that, that she was letting herself in for just an incredible amount potential, you know, abuse and some, and she took it.\",\n",
       "  \". Speaker 1: Quickly tell me, do you know how it all came about? Can you, in a nutshell, He--she accused him or something or-- Speaker 2: Um-hm. Speaker 1: What was the historical reference is that he was being confirmed and then she accused him of sexual harassment. Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: And, that was--that's the end of the story. And, then it took on the life that we saw in the media.\",\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: Well-- Speaker 1: What did race have to do with it? Speaker 2: Well, you know, I mean, here you have two black people and so, some people felt, I mean, it depends on how you were looking at it. Some people felt that Anita Hill should never have done that because it's a black man and it's embarrassing and, you know. And, Cla- and other people felt that Clarence Thomas was not the appropriate person to have that job, because, just because he was a black man. He didn't share Justice Marshall's [Thurgood Marshall] opinions and philosophy, and judicial philosophy at all. In fact, he was total opposite that. So, a lot of people felt he wasn't qualified. But, they, they looked for somebody black who, you know, who didn't represent the black community in terms of his, his views. And, so, they felt that he was not, you know, the right candidate for the job. And, so, I, I mean, everybody had a different sort of way of viewing it through this prism, you know. And, certainly, like I said, if it had been a white justice or, you know, person from some other ethnic group and, let's--or Japanese. And, then a Japanese woman came and said, don't--you know, and sort of accused him of sexual harassment. The issue was sexual harassment, really more than race, I think. And, I think that it just became almost more of a circus, you know, more sensational because (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So-- Speaker 2: Because the people were black. Speaker 1: Quickly tell me, do you know how it all came about? Can you, in a nutshell, He--she accused him or something or-- Speaker 2: Um-hm. Speaker 1: What was the historical reference is that he was being confirmed and then she accused him of sexual harassment. Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: And, that was--that's the end of the story. And, then it took on the life that we saw in the media.\",\n",

       "  'Speaker 1: But then Rodney King, before Rodney King there is another big media sort of a black media story. And, I wanna get--have you comment on it, and that was Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Speaker 1: What did it mean to have that played out on TV for black Americans?',\n",

There wasn't--no one took women seriously. And there was a view that why should I waste a limited opportunity to get people placed, African Americans placed? Why would I waste that on, you know, these women? And so, I think they thought they had a very reasoned position of the notion, the notion of sexual harassment. And I don't even think they thought it was, was that. That had gone on so much at Howard undergraduate school. And it, it just, it wasn't considered, you know, you weren't supposed to challenge it.

There was a sex--level of sexual harassment up to the point that actually, I and some others led a sort of a protest against the law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]. You know, it was, it was, you know, it was getting ridiculous. And they just hadn't caught up with where the world was, you know, they hadn't read the 'Feminine Mystique,' [Betty Friedan] I guess (laughter). They hadn't seen that there was a whole Civil Rights Movement across the country. You know, they were just, even though you had great stars, who had been a part of the '54 [1954] decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], and a part of a number of major milestones in, in, you know, civil rights law, they just didn't quite get it. And it was also very hierarchical. They just really still saw anybody aspiring to be a lawyer, so sort of a--to me, there were levels of which they sort of saw us as second-class citizens--not to say you didn't have great professors. We had great professors like Janice Parks [ph.] and others, and Julian Duggan [ph.] and others. I mean, you know, we had--and Clarence Clyde Ferguson [Jr.]--I mean, he was the dean of the law school then and he was a real star, he was a real star. And, but there was this attitude. There was this sexism. There were levels of sexual harassment and it was just--we--so we ultimately had to challenge this into our system.\",\n",

And I, I won't give his name, but I do remember having--when I went to him about reconfirming that because I, you know, that, that's what Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] said. That was part of why I decided to go to Howard. I was going to get married. This way, we didn't have to worry about this particular expense. And when I arrived in his office to talk about, you know, yes, this is what I--the letter you said, et cetera, et cetera. There was clear pressure presented in, in both his physical conduct and his verbal statements that there was--this was a quid pro quo. And but, you know, I, I got the scholarship without the, you know, having to worry about that.

Sylvia Drew was in my class, you know, and it was--I'm just thinking back on some of the women. And it was very hard for us to get called on. You could raise your hand, and they--often the professors ignored you. The only time they wanted to call on you is if it was involving something like rape. You know, it was just unbelievable. It was just so blatant. And so, that was, that was the first time I think I so, was up so, you know, sexism was so apparent, so obvious, so inescapable. Speaker 1: So fourteen women out of how many students in the class? Speaker 2: I guess it was about two hundred students, you know, and there were fourteen women in the class and-- Speaker 1: So, how did that feel? Was there fear? Was there anger? Speaker 2: No, I, I, you know, I'd been well-prepared by daddy [Carlisle Edward Pratt] to feel, you know, I'm supposed to be here. So I, you know, their attitude was not affecting what I thought about, you know, myself. It was just very frustrating to have to deal with it. The, you know, you--not to be able to be called on. If you went to the faculty often for help, they thought you were making yourself available for a pass. So, it was, it was, it was challenging in that regard.\",\n",

So, the home next door, I guess it looked very ordinary in the daytime. But at night, it turned into something else. It was like a silk stocking situation. I\\'m trying to think of a euphemism for what they were doing. You know, I\\'ll describe what they were doing; they were having sex parties. And they were doing the kinds of things people do when they\\'re having a sex party, okay. And I would look in the window at night and see everything that was going on; I was about twelve. And then I had, my mother [Elizabeth Henderson] had given me \\n diary, a little diary with a lock on it. And so, I would write what I saw. And I started this diary, as a little girl might do. I was very interested in Hopalong Cassidy, and Dale Evans, and Gene Autry, and all those. And I used to, you know, just write little stories about that. But then I\\'d see that, what was going on next door, and it was so interesting about what I\\'d see grown folks doing. And so I wrote that, and I wrote it in the first person, because I found that that was so interesting. And then I wrote about what some of the older men were trying to do me, as a young girl. Speaker 2: The men that stayed in the rooming house? Speaker 1: No, this was in my own house, we had roomers. Speaker 2: Yeah, that\\'s what I mean, in your house-- Speaker 1: Uh-huh, yeah, we had roomers. Speaker 2: --which was a rooming house, yeah. Speaker 1: And some of these men in my house were fondling me. And so, I wrote that. And I also wrote an early incident about what my father [Harvey Reynolds] was doing with me, and I wrote that. But the unfortunate thing was I mixed it all up in a child\\'s imagination. Some of it was the real truth, and some of it was just fantasy. Story_ID: 277790 Speaker 1: And so, my mother [Elizabeth Henderson] somehow found it; my grandmother [Reynolds\\' maternal step-grandmother, Mae Stewart] who raised me found the little diary. And she thought that was something was terribly wrong with me. And so she took me to a doctor, and the doctor said, \"This child is a virgin. She\\'s making all this stuff up.\" And so, what should have been believed was not believed, because it just seemed like it was all fantasy, and some of it was and some of it wasn\\'t. But what happened, she talked to a social worker who thought that I should be put into an institution for evaluation. And so I went into this institution, and they misdiagnosed me as mentally ill. And I ended up as one of the early, one of the youngest persons in a mental institution, which was one of those big warehouses they used to have in Ohio. And-- Speaker 2: So this was--you were about twelve then? Speaker 1: I was about twelve. I couldn\\'t have been, I wasn\\'t a teenager yet. Speaker 2: Okay, so this is 1954 or around that time? Speaker 1: Around that age. Speaker 2: Okay, yeah. Speaker 1: And they, they had done some diagnosis to show that I was insane. And actually, all that was was the making of a writer. But anyway, they put me in this mental institution. And there were horrible stories. There was just... there was this big white woman with blonde hair that fondled me once as I tried to go down these, this winding staircases. I remember a mouse being in my shoe, somebody had put it there. I remember bats flying ahead, overhead. It was, I remember all of us being served food out in the middle of this thing, you know. I remember people screaming at night. And I remember being injected with some kind of drugs. And this was my first experience that showed me that you could change your reality by using drugs. And somehow my grandmother, when she visited me, she could understand what she had really done, you know, and she worked to get me out of there. I can\\'t even remember how long I was there. It seemed like maybe it couldn\\'t have been over a couple of months. But it was a horrible, horrible, experience to think that my first experience with writing made me end up in a mental institution. So, you know, for years I never, ever wrote. I went to poetry, but I never did any kind of self-examination again, or I never put myself in stories again, because I just had this very bad experience of what could happen. It would take me maybe forty years again to write anything personal. But it was a horrible experience. It taught me, you know, not to trust, you know.

I've got a notice that they were starting this, these classes at the United Theological center [sic.] in Dayton [Ohio]--seminary [United Theological Seminary] in Dayton. So I went up there to investigate about getting my doctorate. And [Reverend Dr.] Claudette [A.] Copeland was the professor. And she wanted twelve black women to study under her, to learn how to build models of care for women in America. And so twelve of us came to study under her. And my assignment was to build a model of care for women struggling with alcohol and drugs. Another woman's assignment was to deal with depression.

The Deltas had, they--we thought we had some agreements but any rate, we had a lot of agreements with women, white women and others in the South that when the black girls were being, the kids were being arrested, that they would go and do the bail for the black girls because they were being raped by the jailers at night. So there was all this heightened activity and Delta involvement so, I was saying, \"Well, what is this?\" I didn\\'t know nothing about Bennett at the time and they quickly explained that the Bennett girls were activists and the, that these sit-ins had not worked in February, so they were leading a civil rights march to the down--they were gonna sit down in the middle of Greensboro and stay there.

They talked about abortion in ways that were not comfortable--white women did--for black women, and when I saw--I thought, \"Oh, my God. That\\'s not the way to talk about that.\" But I also knew that black women who didn\\'t talk about abortion knew more about it than they were willing to talk about because, don\\'t forget, I had eavesdropped on my mother\\'s [Velma Lee Moore] conversations with her girlfriends and I knew that there were women in our communities who had all of these homemade remedies for how to abort. I heard women talk about falling down steps, about women taking, douching in lye, about women taking turpentine--I heard all those conversations when I was a young girl, and I knew about midwives who performed abortions by dilating the uterus in St. Louis [Missouri] and in East St. Louis [Illinois]. So I knew that black women had abortions, but I also knew it was a very private thing. It was nothing that they talked about, but I knew that they knew how to do it and much of it was learned during slavery when black women aborted white babies that were the result of basically rapes by white. So I knew that, but I also knew that white women wanted to raise the level of discussion about abortions because they were talking about your right to determine whether or not you could do that. Black women already knew that if they wanted to do it, they were going to do it. It was nobody\\'s business. White women were trying to get it accepted in the medical world. We didn\\'t have the medical world. We didn\\'t have the luxury of fighting for our doctors to do it. We had the ways to get it done and didn\\'t get it done through doctors. This was done through midwives and other kinds of things that women learned how to do.

I went, when I was a part of the team that was going about trying to save and isolate the corporate office from the Hanes Group [Hanesbrands Inc.] and its troubles, I used to come up to Chicago [Illinois] often to meet with them and give them an update of what was happening at Hanes, and so forth, and so one night, one day I was supposed to be in New York [New York]. I think we were doing some television work or whatever, but anyway, we were going to stay in the corporate apartment. I\\'m thinking I was the only woman and these three men, and I\\'m trying to figure out, okay, how is this going to work? So, the president made sure he gave me the master suite, basically, with the separate toilet, bathrooms and all that, but it also had a huge fireplace in the living room, so I was talking to the senior VP over at corporate affairs, human relations, human resources at the time, and he started rubbing my arm, the fireplace is going, we\\'re drinking schnapps or whatever, Courvoisier brandy or whatever. This was after dinner and after, you know, and he said, \"I want to talk to you.\" And it was very obvious what he was doing, and see by this time I could spell ha- sexual harassment and I knew what it looked like. I knew what it looked like, I knew what it felt like. Before I didn\\'t know what it looked like and what it felt like. I knew I didn\\'t want any part of it, and he said, \"Is this bothering you?\" I said, \"No, if it\\'s not bothering you; but I wish you\\'d stop.\" And so I got up and I went to my room and I closed the door and I thought, okay, there you go. You\\'re down the tubes. So, the next morning he would not even, he never spoke to me again after that, and he was the senior VP of human resources, and I don\\'t know whether he thought I was going to file a claim, I don\\'t know whether he thought I was going to file a claim. I don\\'t know whether he thought how dare I rebuff him? I mean, we had been very cordial before that, but he iced me out and actually I was glad.',\n",

And so, I decided that I would not be a victim, and I got promoted and this guy was supposedly, dotted line, reporting to me, so he told everybody I was reporting to him. He went to Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina]. Well, I went to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], okay? So, he had made all these jokes, so I got him in the TV studio and I slammed him against the wall and I said, \"Look, kid.\" You know, and I\\'m black. I was 115 pounds soaking wet, so I was no (unclear). I said, \"Stop with the jokes.\" And I said to him, \"Stop with all the negative stuff.\" \"Oh, I\\'m just joking.\" I said, \"Man, I grew up in the South.\" I said, \"That\\'s how white people made fun of black people all my life.\" I said, \"It\\'s not a joke to me.\" I scared him to death.

So I was available to them for whatever their problems were; whether they were not making the right grades, whether they were being harassed by a teacher, or they thought they were being harassed by a teacher. But I also did it for white students as well. They came with similar problems. The major, one of the major functions of that position was to decide who would be considered in state and out of state. Because there is an immense difference in the, in the tuition of in state students and out of state students. And I developed a criteria for determining who was in state and who was out of state, and applied that--saw that that criteria was applied to every student about whom there was a question. So those were my two, were my three (gesture) major functions as, as associate vice president.',\n",

You didn\\'t see that many fair-skinned people that didn\\'t have fair--other fair-skinned people in their families. And so while I think rape was common during my mother\\'s day, I think many people aborted or did not have a child. But my mother did, and he was such a wonderful person. He was, he was so good that when he was living in the country, as he did with my grandmother [Annie Young O\\'Neal] until he was in the eighth grade--and that\\'s as far as the country schools went. Then, by then my father [Junius Reed] had left, my father. My biological father had left. And so I said to Mama, \"Why can\\'t we have Jay [James O\\'Neal] to come\" because I loved him dearly. And she did. He came and lived with us and finished high school in, at Butler High School [Hartsville, South Carolina], the same place that I finished.

We were still The Primettes, and it really just--she was abused by a neighborhood person and it just actually destroyed her, totally destroyed her. Speaker 1: She was? Speaker 2: She was never, ever, ever the same. The thing that we thought was that she would get over this, but this was a time when before people would talk about these things. So, everyone kept it really quiet. She never got the help that she was supposed to get to kind of help her get beyond it. So, Diane [Diana Ross] and I, and I\\'m speaking for Diane now only because I\\'m thinking she thinking the same way I did, was that we thought once we became famous and rich you know, Florence would be over it you know, but she never did. So, when little things started coming here, she doesn\\'t--she\\'s a very family--she was a really the kind of person who wanted to be with her family. So, now we\\'re never home, we\\'re always traveling and she wanted to be you know with her family and she felt, you know, this has kind of hurt her and then when she no longer could sing anything other than our, \"Oohs,\" or, \"ahs,\" that tore at her. So, every little thing started tearing at her and anytime something was not going the way we wanted it, her wanting it or whatever, then it would just, she would get deep depressed, depressed and pretty soon it just really, it really destroyed her.

I said, \"Make sure you leave it to me you know.\" And I remember sitting there thinking about that stole and, and how I had asked her to leave me that stole.

You know she would tell you, she could tell you, and you know people always could have the last, last say? Flo was that kind of way, she always could come up with the right thing would be the--whatever. She always was the kind of person, also was the kind of person who had this very hearty laugh. If Flo was happy, she could laugh and everybody would be laughing, she just had this Santa Claus, ho, ho, ho--kind of laugh, and she was just real. Florence was a real--I would say she was like a real black--have you ever seen a real black good woman? Flo was that woman (laughter), you know. She was that way, but she also had a great voice. I also--I always thought she sounded very much--she had the kind of style of Etta James style. So, she really had a good R and B sound and, and her voice was pure, she had a pure, pure voice, and I think the only thing that really made her--I won't say made her happy, but the only thing that she really--she loved to sing, that's what she loved to do. That was all--I think that was her biggest thing, and then once she was no longer singing, her children were her, the, the love of her life, her children, she loved her children, but singing was what made Flo, so when that was no longer there, she lost a lot of herself.\",\n",

The only man that she really excluded for the possibility that I might experience this was my dad. So, after this was over, I went home, and I remember my parents were sitting at the table. And I walked in telling (laughter) what had happened, and, and I told them exactly what had happened.

His father owned the clinic [Hillcrest-Allen Clinic and Hospital, Hoschton, Georgia]. The clinic was next to the house. I went to see the house when I was about ten. And, it was still there.

But, my grand- her father was dark. It\\'s a funny thing in our race, and we\\'re getting back to it now, they still doing it in school. I have a lot of little mentees so this is another story for another time though. I had to go and see about a little girl who they were calling black because her skin color was, was dark.

Speaker 1: --came and got my grandmother and took her out to a tree and tied her to a tree. And, during those days, my mama said my grandmother wore white cotton stockings, you know, they would do that \\'cause she work so hard and had had all those children. I guess she had varicose veins or something. And, she said that they beat her until the skin on her legs rolled down in the stockings. And, said, that--I get emotional when I think about it (crying). But, she told them, she was such a strong woman, she told them, say, \"You might kill me but you can\\'t eat me. You--Dr. Allen\\'s son raped my daughter and I entrusted him to go there.\" She was trying to help the family by ironing clothes and the, the boy who was my mother\\'s father drove up and said, \"Let her go.\" And, she had them put her in his car and he took her back to where she lived and, and treated her. But, when they took the stockings off the skin came off. But, she was bloody everywhere but they said that, and he told this story, said that, to my grandmother, said, \"Your mama is some woman.\" Even in the midst of about ten men beating her, they didn\\'t wanna just kill her. That was too easy. They wanted her to suffer. And, when they told her, she just said, the last thing she said before she passed out, \"You can kill me, but you cannot eat me.\" And, looked them right in the eyes, with the hoods over their faces.

So it was a real big dilemma to figure out how I am going to get this degree, if that s what I want to do for the rest of my life and how do I handle all this. It was a huge decision to go to Ohio State. I had planned to take my son with me while I did that, and then get my degree and come back. There was going to be one job in the state of Oklahoma that possibly would be available, that I might be able to qualify for. So I went based on that job being open and obviously it was and I did get the job. After I got there it was, again, a male dominated program. I thought, What am I doing here as a woman who left her family because she wanted to get this degree for the future? I did not know of any other women and that was what my ex-husband told me. He said, Name another woman who has done this. I could not come up with one, so I thought, This is really unusual. When I got the job as a college professor, I was the only female in the college of business. And it took me awhile to figure it out, but I was sexually harassed for a period of time, and I kept thinking, Something s wrong with me, I m causing that. For a while I just didn t know what was going on. I finally realized that s what it was. So I went and talked to the dean about it and he took care of it right away. But, it was a little painful to go through that because I respected the person and yet I thought it was me and didn t realize that there was more there. So, that was painful. I think sometimes just not having that female role model to say Yeah, somebody has done this before, and somebody has left their family to go do this. It s not, I m not abnormal, and to work through the sexual harassment. Then, once I came here and was in the CareerTech field, my former supervisor and mentor, Bruce Grey, took me under his wing. He took me to the superintendent s meeting and again, there would not be women there. But he treated me so professionally. Everybody else treated me professionally and it was very smooth and so I did not feel tremendous pressure for being a woman, necessarily. Nowadays the climate has changed It has changed, it has. There are those women out there and those administrators, and it is different. I',\n",
       "  '11 Martin Nykolaiszyn Martin Nykolaiszyn That s been one of my passions because, again, when I grew up you didn t go into a non-traditional field. From my vantage point, because I didn t know anyone who had these other positions but the teacher, the secretary or the nurse those were the jobs for women. And so I have felt really passionate about giving women opportunities for other positions because they can do any of those jobs. So some of our non-traditional programs for women would be, for example, the engineering program. I m very passionate about the number of women, they tell me there s about 25 percent, but I think there s less than that because, again, so many young women don t grow up with the female role model of an engineer. We started a program called GirlTech and each girl who is in one of these non-traditional areas is paired with a mentor who helps them through some of those tough times or gives them somebody to talk to. For example, the girls in pre-engineering will be paired with a female engineer and that gives them a huge opportunity to work through some of those challenges. In our automotive technician program, there s tremendous opportunities for women because they can be so skilled in those areas. But it s a tough, tough thing. Our society still does not look favorably, sometimes, upon women being automotive technicians or they, again, could be harassed. I try to encourage any of those women in those areas because they re great paying jobs. It gets them out of a financial hole and gives them a tremendous opportunity.',\n",

He had written the book Race and Gender that I had been using for the class, and it was an amazing time to spend with him, but I knew that I knew a lot more about race than I had thought I did.

And then ageism the different generations just integrated itself in, and that s how those things just happened. They just integrated themselves in. When we started out, sexual harassment was not an issue to begin with. It had always been an issue, but we hadn t talked about it, and then oh probably after the first session or two, we got into sexual harassment before it was out there in the mainstream. Were many colleges and universities integrating these types of courses? No, no, no, no, no. That s why I was asked to come and help put them together. I spoke at a lot of conferences and gave out all the information I had, sent them to places yeah no. I just had different support. I was so fortunate that I had somebody like Jay Boggs, and I had our dean, Robert Sandmeyer, and I had my department head early on, and my colleagues.

But because it has become [one], people have had to take public stands on...Which side are you on?

Many people who would make decisions about...If they had their own daughters or their own...who would make a decision one way, who may do that secretly anyhow.

       "  \"We organized like, a feminist counseling service out of those different kinds of services and consciousness raising groups and I mean there was just a lot of activity with many, many, many hundreds of women ... all kinds of women ... who were involved in it. All kinds of women and all kinds of points of view that were constantly ...sometimes were working together, sometimes were arguing with each other. I remember someone brought in a copy of Ms. magazine and on the cover of Ms. magazine was this picture of this woman with a black eye and it was first time anybody actually talked about violence against women in that way. There was talk about rape, but not about battery and the person oddly, coincidently, weirdly enough that wrote that article was Del Martin, the same person that started the D.O.B. It's very weird. And so she started the Daughters of Bilitis in like the 1950s and she ended up writing this book called Battered Women and there was this cover of Ms. magazine an article that she wrote. We all started talking about it ... a whole group of us got together ... and we thought we should just keep talking about it and keep talking about it and we did and eventually we decided we'd start a battered women's shelter. At the time there was a battered women's shelter in England, in London. There was a battered women's shelter in Minneapolis. And there was a battered women's shelter in San Francisco. I think there might have been something or other in Boston and that was it for the country. So, we basically just made it up. I mean, we did a lot of reading. We did a lot of talking and we started announcing that we were starting to work on this. And all these women whose mother had been beaten up, whose sisters or themselves just started sort of coming to these meetings and started telling us what was going on. So, we opened this shelter for battered women ... it's called the Center for Battered Women ... it still exists ... and there were three staff members at the time and I was one of them. We started this shelter which started small and now unfortunately, I think is now the biggest shelter I think in the country. It's like just huge, humongous and it's not a good thing, I don't think. So, I did that ...I mean, there was a very long lead up to it, of course, I mean because we had figure out what the hell was going on and we had to train ourselves to do this work. Then over a period of a couple of years the shelter grew and we raised money. Over a period of years what happened was basically ... and this had happened to the rape crisis movement too ... it was changing from a movement into a social service and there were sort of competing ideologies. We always thought that you couldn't stop battery without questioning patriarchy ... that's the language of the times ... and so, you know, a lot of what I did even when I was doing all of this direct service work was, I would go out and I would talk to all of these women ... you know, women who were in WIC programs, women who were getting welfare about what was going on and have political conversations, talk about our services but have political conversations.\",\n",

I mean, it's huge anyway ... but it's huge in jails. I just read this statistic that seventy-five percent of women in jails have diagnosable mental illness. That's ... that's an intense number. You know, and more than sixty percent have been victims of child abuse and sexual abuse. There's this huge correlation between injection drug use and sexual abuse.

Maybe in Los Angeles city jails, where the, where maybe a lot of the guards a Latino, you know, maybe, but if you go into actual prisons, what you see is White people keeping Black people or people of color in cages. That is what you see and that's what goes on. And so the degradation, the ... just everyday shame the huge, huge, huge discrepancy of power. Power, I mean in the most gross form, goes on every single minute of the day. Every single minute of the day.

The only equivalent would be like slavery.

As soon as I began to hint at the full dimensions of what the problem was ... which is, essentially, that my stepfather was after my little sister ... they panicked. The mental health people there really didn't know how to deal with it. And so their response was that I was hysterical and that that meant I was not necessarily a good scholarship student.

I don't think that I was non-monogamous as a feminist choice. I think I was non-monogamous because I was an incest survivor and I was afraid of intimacy.

There's a lot of work you can do as a feminist to understand violence and the repercussions of violence and how it shapes you, but some of it is really resistant to change, really resistant. Going to meetings and realizing that I was not this unique, astonishing creature. No, we're all prone to self-destructive models. But the particular permutations of how I had organized my self-destructive life were really interesting and complicated. I call myself high-function broken, which for me is a way of talking about all the ways that all the experiences of my life have contributed to making me a really ... I mean, I can do shit. I can buckle down and work, and that is a power and a talent that many people don't have access to. But I am broken. You know, I was broken so young and so thoroughly that there is damage that ... I tell people it's life work. I will get through this incarnation and barely manage to become what most people are to begin with. There's just some real serious broken parts of me.

I just did this talk at the University of Wyoming and read a story that\\'s really intricate and tricky and complicated and about being in a violent family, a different kind of story. At the end of it, this little boy stands up, and he says, \"I know you write out of your family.\"\\x9d And he\\'s like, How did you not die? Why are you alive? Survivor\\'s guilt? Big question. I\\'m like, All right, I\\'ll tell you the truth, I am alive because I\\'m a lesbian. And this is not something this culture understands or honors, but if I had been heterosexual like all my cousins, I\\'d be dead. About that I have no doubt. If I were still alive, I\\'d be living in a trailer park in Greenville, South Carolina, with a bunch of kids, some of whom would be dead. Because that\\'s what I was raised to be. It\\'s not about good or evil or justice. That is what I was supposed to do, and it\\'s what would have happened. But because I was a baby dyke, I was not going to be pregnant at 15. It could have happened, because I was being raped fairly regularly, but I lucked out. I lucked out by getting syphilis at 12, so I\\'m sterile. All of the places that mean I\\'m alive actually had some built-in cost to them, but they\\'re costs that the women in my family pay regularly and die from. Early pregnancy is really destructive to your health. Alcoholism, drug addiction ... no, you don\\'t survive too long. But I read books and learned how to hide, which is how you survive in violent families. I\\'ve always been guilty about it. I still am, but I recognize it. To know that and to write stories out of it and not hate yourself is a profoundly feminist act. But some of your motivation for doing things also comes out of the guilt. Looking at my family and seeing, you know, because I got appendicitis my freshman year in college and went to a doctor who realized that I had pelvic inflammatory disease and treated me for it ... because that could have killed me if it had continued untreated. I lucked out by getting sick at 14 and getting antibiotics. Otherwise, I would have had syphilis, which is, you know, not a good diagnosis. Luck. I believe in luck, like the rest of the working class. But maybe within the luck there\\'s also purpose. Or you tell yourself there\\'s a reason. There\\'s a reason I\\'m alive and my cousin Billy\\'s dead, and my mom is dead, and all my aunts are dead. All the women older than me that I looked to for a model are dead, and I\\'ve got to be the model.',\n",
       "  \"I think there were about, maybe, 12 women in the room, and they had that whole thing where you pass the ... it was a shell. You could only talk if you had the shell. Do you remember how consciousness-raising groups worked? (lau\\nhs) I think there might even have been an announced subject, but nobody paid any fucking attention to it. The first woman to speak actually was the director of the Women's Center at the time, and she was drunk, which was a little bit startling to me. And I think it was the second or third woman that spoke that just killed me, because it was one of the secretary-looking women ... very well dressed, lots of makeup ... took hold of that shell like it was a life raft, and started talking almost immediately about, she needed help because, you know, she looked good, she was in control, everything was working. But she woke up in the middle of the night every night ... every fucking night ... wanting to get up and go drive to Georgia and kill her father. And then she said why. And no person in my life or anywhere in my imagination had ever said it out loud. I didn't think you could say it loud and still live. And that she was so different from me confounded it. It just changed everything. There's this thing that happens. I had gotten used to, as a kid, to moving a lot. I was used to the phenomenon of, land in a new place, present yourself. You always have a story. And I played, when I was young, with being different people when we ... because we moved every six months or less. So I was used to the present-yourself. I always had a draft of myself, and I designed the story I told about myself for what I wanted ... mostly to be taken seriously. But the moment she started talking, the self that I had been preparing to present, which was about looking good to that woman in that beanbag chair, disappeared. Everything disappeared, and it was like, I am not ready to talk about this, but I'm going to keep coming back and figure out how to talk about this, and how to make a difference. ANDERSON: How long did it take before you were able to talk about it in that group? ALLISON: Whew! Well, probably about the same time I started sleeping with the girl in the beanbag chair. A couple weeks, not long, not long. Although the way I talked about it was very careful, very careful. ANDERSON: What were you censoring? ALLISON: How complicated incest really is. I was actually censoring who I was, trying to present as middle class, because I had a college education and I didn't want to be my mother or my sisters, and doing fairly ... what I thought was a fairly good job of presenting as middle class. I had a job with the Social Security Administration. I did not wear high heels, but still, I could look like a secretary, and I was trying. It would be three years before I would ever really get to the place where I was talking nakedly. And it would be a decade before I could really ... before that stuff all cracked and I could really look at it and talk about it frankly. There was just no language. And all the stuff that was deeply complicated about ... was impossible to talk about quickly. Sometimes you have to wait for the culture to catch up with you. The thing that nearly destroyed me, both as a kid and as a young adult, was that being raped could provoke a sexual response, and that you could eroticize violence, which is exactly how I survived. I understand a lot of it now ... I'm 58 years old ... but I did not understand it back then, and I could not have articulated it. But it does inculcate an enormous amount of self-hatred, and that's dangerous to talk about. And even when you can talk about it, I talked about it in very structured, abbreviated ways. And let's be frank, the early women's movement was a movement of slogans and simplicity, and I was not simple and I hated slogans. ANDERSON: Yeah. ALLISON: Yeah. ANDERSON: Yeah. But you still broke the silence for the first time around (inaudible) that CR group. ALLISON: And that's, I think, what triggers a lot of energy and empowerment, and then the long, slow process of actually sorting through all that stuff and starting to make changes in your life. That takes a lot ... ANDERSON: Yeah. ALLISON: A lot. The women's movement was ready for a lot of what I was ready for, but there were some things I was ready for that the women's movement was not yet ready for. (laughs)\",\n",

And that sometimes a slap feels like a caress, and to actually begin to have those conversations. That's where I began to have those conversations. I couldn't have them in my academic, literary feminist world. Nobody would talk about it, and they didn't have ... or if they had the feelings, they were not going to admit they had the feelings, or that they had the experience.\",\n",

I\\'m like, All right, what is really going on here? Why? And especially after I started interviewing people about fetish and all of that eroticization. I was like, Okay, what if I organized my sex life the way I organized my political life? Could we really make this a little safer and saner?

How would you monitor that? ALLISON: Oh goodness. One is that ... My ideology, my conviction, is to honor all perversion, which means, you know, the girls that want to come and just watch get just as much respect as the ones who want to put on a show. A lot of people who go to parties ... it\\'s about exhibitionism and honoring that, but trying to make it so that no one was being harassed or forced to do stuff they didn\\'t want to do.

You make sure there are no drugs, because then you get busted. You make sure there are no people underage, because then you get busted. You make sure nobody\\'s got a camera, because then people can get blackmailed. And you watched ... you have certain rules for how parties proceed, which means you can ...

And there was this constant struggle about whether it was radical or whether it was reform. ANDERSON: Right. ALLISON: Some of that is coded ... I always thought ... was a coded argument, because the real argument is ... (chuckles) ... the real argument was, who was career making and who was trying to change the world?

He had an enormous collection, and that's how I found what I found out about lesbians. The things I knew about lesbians was that they were rapists and they had hairy nipples.

I mean, these are just wonderful memories that I have. Um, there was a darkness in my life. I was sexually abused by a relative, um, when I was very young, and I've never mentioned it to my family. My family knows nothing at all about it. And that ... I think that does things to a child that somehow takes the wonder off things, that it tarnishes trust in a way that ... that you can still smile and run around and have a good time and fun but there's just a little bit something that happens and it's not good. It's ... whether it's guilt or because I think you always feel like somehow responsible even though you're 9 or 10 years old and this is an adult, um, but it's a very tragic thing, and it's ... although I don't believe in the death penalty, it's left me so angry that I would never be willing to sit on a jury in a sex abuse case because I know I couldn't be reasonable about it. I couldn't weigh with any measure because of my own feelings. ANDERSON: Did this go on into high school? APUZZO: No, it went - well, it went on into like, the eighth grade, about. ANDERSON: And then did you sort of block it out, compartmentalize it? APUZZO: I compartmentalized ... yeah, I just compartmentalized it but, you know, being Catholic, you know, being Catholic and having sex be such, you know, an overwhelming issue and inordinately, inordinately demonized by the church, when something like that is your first sexual experience, you just, um, you always carry it. You always feel that there's a burden of guilt on you, somehow you did it. You were responsible. It was your fault. At any rate ... ANDERSON: Did you get help from any adult at that time? APUZZO: No. I've never gotten ... I've never ... ANDERSON: Not ... no teachers, no one? APUZZO: No. No. Um, but I entered high school, and uh, was delighted to be there, had a great time. You know, a lot of us who went to Catholic school who were lesbian have crushes on teachers. I had the experience where the teachers had crushes on me. And it was overwhelming in not a good way. ANDERSON: How did they display their affection towards you? APUZZO: One nun kept a diary that she would give to me periodically. And um, it just ... it wasn't abuse in the way that we're experiencing the church today but it was ... it was emotionally imposing. It was...I was 13 years old. Um, to have all that attention, to be kept after school, to just ... for someone else's enjoyment. I mean, I got off on it. It was not like the world's worst thing, but again, there is a burden of an adult imposing their emotional needs on a youngster. This is just ... it's a theme in my life. ANDERSON: Did they do this to any other young woman that you knew of? APUZZO: Oh, yeah, you know. The nuns ... mostly the girls had crushes on the nuns, you know, and you knew the girls who had crushes on the nuns and it was, you know, it's like, very girl, blah-blah.

So next, Lillie moved it up to the big area, outside area, in the big hallway, in the walk path. So it was huge. And it was really there that I think we really started to understand that we are the ones we were waiting for, like June Jordan said, and that the answers are in our stories, and it's in the process of telling our stories that can set us free and put us on the right path. So it was such a gift, and it was such a wonderful way to learn about our health issues, to learn about how much violence that we were living with ... be it domestic violence, be it sexual violence ... to know that so many women have been raped, that so many women have been victims of sexual abuse, and have had no way to talk about it, to heal, and how when women do it in isolation or when it's done to us in isolation, we think that we're the only people having it happen, that nobody else in the world is having it happen. But what we learn in the presence of other black women, that this is happening, we understand that we have an institution of sexism that's going on in our lives that tends to oppress us, and that the only way we can get out from under it is to learn how to unhook. And that was the gift that Lillie brought to the black women's health movement, is how do we unhook, and the value of storytelling.\",\n",

We connected, and she was very influential in helping me think about reproductive health ... helping me work through things about rape, about abortion, about a lot of the hard issues and things that I really had never talked to anyone about.

And so, we went, first to Johannesburg. We started in Jo'burg, and we taught the women the Self-Help. But we asked the women ... it was very interesting ... we asked them to get us a cross section of women. We didn't just want the ones who were the professionals, we also wanted the regular women, you know. Of course, the Johannesburg people only brought in the professionals, because they didn't think the other women were ready. So, we trained them in Self-Help. But what was so wonderful, one of the women, Mankubo Manelepe(?), lived in Lenenye(?), in the Northern Transvaal of South Africa, and she was a smart woman. She brought a band of 16 women from Lenenye to the Johannesburg meeting. And so, they were there. They were rural women. They were there among the training that we did. We taught them Self-Help, we talked about our issues, we focused in three areas. These were the areas that were identified by the women in South Africa, and each of us ... there were five of us ... and each of us were paired with a South African woman. But the areas they identified were domestic violence, sex abuse, and HIV/AIDS. Those were the three areas they identified that they wanted to talk about. I think it was HIV/AIDS. I think it was.\",\n",
       "  \"I think that, though, one thing that I must say that stands out crystal clear to me was probably the most important thing I did was ask the question, What's the difference between black women's health issues and white women's health issues? Mostly because that placed an emphasis on looking at us based on our ethnicity, our culture, our subculture, the way we were reared, the things that go on in our life and how that affects our health, and the fact that we as black women have a different perspective. I was really perplexed by, when white women got together, really the most of the things they only wanted to talk about were reproductive health issues. But when black women got together, and we started talking about health, we started talking about different things. We started talking about things that had to do with psychological well-being. We started talking about issues that were affecting our lives ... violence, sexual abuse ... and also, white women were talking about these things, but they were not priorities. And reproductive health ... black women would use reproductive health services but they were not priorities. And so, the whole thing that makes our health issues unique to us depends on looking at what are our specific priorities that have been influenced by who we are and our ethnicities. I\",\n",

We took a delegation of 25 women and one man to Africa to the Women's Conference, and that was ... just getting people there and back was an experience in itself. But then the conference on top of that was just incredible ... and to have it in Kenya and to have those African women with their congas made special for the conference and to have all the hundreds of workshops and the daily newspapers. And a film was made of us called It's Up to Us that was made by a woman from Connecticut, Bea Milwe. She followed us around and we found this women's group out in the rural part of Nairobi and they raised cows and we went and spent a whole day with them ... dancing, learning about their lives, us telling them about our lives, and learning how different our lives were. And then, not a whole lot that was very similar, that they really lived very different lives from what we had. It made a lot of us a lot more appreciative of our lives. And then, in a lot of ways, they had things that were a lot better than what we had ... that we introduced the word incest to them, that they had no word for it. But we were trying to explain incest to them. And explain rape, which they had kind of vaguely heard of rape happening in Nairobi, but certainly not where they were. And then for incest, they had to do a translation. There was no one word for it. And I sort of was sorry we introduced the term. But then, on the other hand, there was such a reality in our lives to leave there without having them understand that, I think, would've been not being our true, authentic selves. We also collected money and we bought two cows for them and left them with two cows, which was really, really good. I think about those women sometimes and wonder how much has changed, you know, in these years between their lives and our lives.\",\n",
       "  \"LYTHCOTT: Well, we moved there in 1961 and left in 1969. And I can say to you that it helped me to realize that African people could be anything that we wanted to be. It led me to feel very close solidarity with African people, wherever we are, and it resulted in me getting involved in the pan-Africanist movement, something that was very vital to me. Thinking about ... and almost having this ... I'm a very concrete thinker, and so, I almost had this vision in my head of pieces of a puzzle coming back together, as African people from all around the world would pull back together again, with the different strengths and weaknesses that we have based upon the different places of the diaspora where we were sprinkled ... or raped and robbed or whatever. And pan-Africanism became very important to me.\",\n",
       "  \"AVERY: I think it's very important for younger women to gather as many of the cross-cultural reproductive health experiences of women that they can, because they need to show that this is not just something ... like, being in charge of your fertility, your reproduction, it's not just something for American women, European women, that across all the cultures from the beginning of time, this has been something that has been passed from women to women, and that we need to know how do Asians handle it, how do Southeast Asians handle it, how Indians handle it, how everybody handles it, so we have in our psyches a legend of how women have handled reproduction throughout the ages. And sometimes that will be what will give us our courage and give us our strength, because as we look back, we find out that these women ran into difficulties, that they ran into backlashes, that they ran into antis, but that they also ran into people who were grateful for the help that they were able to give them. That it is important to learn about the life of the grand midwives in the South, and how they took care of women who had babies, how they helped women who had had far too many babies and didn't want to have other babies, how they handled women who had been victims of rape, how they handled women who were victims of incest. How they worked with everything in a nonjudgmental way, that, I think it is really, um ... there's a lesson in there for all of us. So, I think, do your homework. Talk to other women. This is not necessarily something you get from books. Go up to women. Start the conversation. Have them talk to their relatives wherever they are, so that we can stop having us think that this is something unique at this time that's going on. It's been going on throughout the ages, and will continue.\",\n",

And more than anything else, I think that if black people are suffering today from the rulings of Clarence Thomas ... and they are ... a lot of it has to do with their refusal to take up Anita Hill's exposure of him as a sexual abuser. And had they taken that a little bit more seriously, they would recognize that black faces in high places is not something that's going to resolve the problems that black women are facing today, nor that other people of color are facing today.

He ran the building trades, which was incredibly sexist, but then again, when 1199 tried to organize hospitals and we\\'re having strikes that were not very effective, he stopped construction, and so when the women would really sit around bad-mouthing Harry, I would defend Harry and say, \"You can talk about what his union is like, but when push comes to shove, the most oppressed working women in New York City would not have a union without Harry.\"\\x9d And those guys who didn\\'t have a feminist bone in their bodies and probably sat there and hooted and whistled at the women picketers when they went out in sympathy, [laugh] but in fact, they went out in sympathy.

BEREK: I was involved in, I guess this was probably the early \\'80s, when there was a mayoral race in New York, we all hated Ed Koch and so there was a mayoral campaign that was very union oriented and there were four union coordinators and there was three guys and me, and there was some big rally with all the big shots speaking and I was out in the audience, running around and getting things done, and Harry was up on the stage and, of course, the three guys were up on the stage. And Harry Van Arsdale looks in the audience and starts going, \"Where is she? Where is she? Where is that girl? She does all the work. The girl should be here, too. Where is she?\"\\x9d And so, I went up on the stage and I was standing there and I was saying to myself, now, he just called me a girl. He\\'s like 85 years old, right? He just called me a girl, but he also announced in front of the entire group that I was the only one who did the work. So you got to just sort of say to yourself, he\\'s in his mid-eighties, he grew up in a time when calling me a girl was not insulting. But, I was insulted. So it was this sort of conflict of, you turn to Harry and [sneer] or you just get up on stage and say, he recognized my work.

At the same time, you know, a lot of my adult work in recent years has been about preventing child sexual abuse, so I went through that whole period of time in my teenage years from the age of 12 to 16, when my father, you know, sexually abused me. So that was a tortuous period for me. I didn't talk about it and, personally, for me, those years ... I had a very happy exterior which I tried to maintain as best I could and I had a tortuous interior\\nlife. The split between those two things ... there will always be some kind of pulling together that I have to do around that. I'm sure we'll talk probably a little bit more about [the abuse], but the overall family life in which my siblings and I were embedded, in the environment my parents worked to create, was a good family life. That's part of what has made me care about prevention, and to want to do whatever we can to pay attention to prevention so that these kinds of families aren't torn apart by a sexual abuse thing happening, which is what would happen in today's world if that happened to me and I'd told about it.\",\n",

I found myself, in the middle of the IWY process, having quite a number of dreams about Bella Abzug setting up circumstances that I would get raped in. It was very extreme. And it was because Bella had this incredible personality which was aggressive. I mean her name, Bella, fit Bella most perfectly. She wasn't full of hatred or anything, but she just threw off her energy any time she wanted, anytime she vented toward anybody. If she didn't like what was going on and you happened to be standing in front of her, she would scream and yell at you, which she did to me at these state meetings, especially the New York meeting. There were a lot of people around her who loved her \\nnd protected her and didn't like to see that part of her, but I just saw it really clearly, and I experienced it really clearly, and I didn't like it one bit. And I dreamt at night about it, in a way, because I had been raised in that circumstance where I'd been harmed by somebody who had just had power over me. So really, it really took a toll on me.\",\n",

I don't believe we addressed rape. WEIGAND: Actually, I said race. HENRY: Oh, race. I'm sorry. WEIGAND: It's OK. HENRY: I'm sorry. WEIGAND: Rape is another interesting question. HENRY: Well, yeah, I was just trying to remember, you know, when we started dealing with that issue, and I think it was within National Women's Commission. I don't think we dealt with race at all at the Massachusetts Governor's Commission.\",\n",

Those ... everybody was for them, but around those issues were issues that were emerging issues. How do you deal with the issue of rape? Is child abuse a feminist issue? And there were commissioners ... Catherine East, in fact ... who argued against including child abuse in our national plan of action. And I made a very strong statement. One of the earliest pieces of activism I did was to work behind the scenes with Gloria Steinem to get child abuse on the agenda. I couldn't, in those days, use child sexual abuse because I wasn't able to be public about what had happened to me, but that's why I did it. We put it under the whole rubric of child abuse, and Gloria made a wonderful argument, you know, that child abuse affects girls disproportionately ... involves women. You know, we need to have child abuse as part of this national plan of action, and she was successful in arguing for that.\",\n",

But other than that, well, I guess that's a strong enough enforcement when you're a kid ... being encouraged. In a way, as I got to be a teenager more ... aside from all the child sexual abuse, which is a story in itself ... I could see that some parents of my friends didn't seem to care much about what their kids did, and I began to value the fact that my parents cared about what we did. They paid attention to it.

It was in every dimension about feminism and about what feminism would represent and how it would represent women and women's oppression and kind of what happened to women and what we would say we understood about women's lives and experiences. So, to me, the fight around pornography and around violence against women and all of those kind of things was ... and where it had resulted, where it had ended by, kind of being siphoned into these identity-based movements, kind of violence ... domestic violence, any pornography, rape crisis, blah-blah, you know, it's like, God, did I never mean this to happen.\",\n",
       "  \". And in complicated stories, I think you generate a very different kind of coming to terms. I'm going to kind of bring it back around again, because I think, I think finally all the political movements that have a moral underbelly often position us in similar ways without having the possibility of complicated relationships to our own oppression and our own power. It's why it's so difficult to be white and deal with racism, and why people want to be... why they're so defensive in that conversation if they're white, why it's so hard to talk about sexism and talk about power relationships. Because there's never a way to really allow your messy history to not be cleaned up, and to not finally decide that you were right and they were wrong, you had no power and they had all of it. Rather than to look at the real framework of how you had very few choices in a world that never saw you, and you did the best you could. That's how I look at my parents. Even with all the bad things that happened. They were not bad people. They did the very best they could. They had limited tools and limited understanding. They brought the best of themselves, they tried as best they could, this is what they could do. I got what they had. They used what they had. And when they didn't have it anymore, they didn't use it. And the job was for me to try and figure out how to survive my own history, and then make different choices. Not blame them for not having good choices. And I don't think you come to terms with things like incest unless you can forgive people who have acted on you in ways that you never deserved.\",\n",
       "  \"But in rural areas, a lot of dating is also driving in cars to isolated places and trying to figure out if you're going to have to fuck. So I started smoking because it was clear to me that in a bad circumstance, you could always light up, that was completely permissible, and when you were smoking a cigarette, it was very hard for a guy to come on to you, but you could also use it \\ns a threat. You could keep a person distanced from you by how you held it, blowing the smoke, I mean, it was just a tool. And, my entire family smoked like, smoked like chimneys, and so, it wasn't like I hadn't started smoking already trying it out, but I remember pretty consistently at twelve, starting to smoke, a lot. And that it was completely tied to dating and to fear about sexuality. Because I didn't actually... I loved being sexually provocative, but I didn't particularly want to date. I mean, I didn't want to fuck. ANDERSON: Had you hit puberty at this point? HOLLIBAUGH: Yeah, I'd hit puberty. And, but, I didn't... you know, when incest is your... that doesn't tell you anything about sex, it just tells you about violation. So, it's not as though you know more, although you're not completely naÃƒÂ¯ve and you know, unaware of where a penis goes, but it doesn't really make a lot of sense to you. So, I started dating this guy. We didn't actually have sex, although we messed around a lot. Um, but he was really a protection, against my father. He was one of my father's friends. My father and he raced motorcycles together every Saturday; he was around all the time. He was somebody I'd known since I was four or five. My mother wasn't too wild that I was twelve and he was 30 or 32 or something, she wasn't like, thrilled on that front. But I think actually they were both, they knew I'd do it anyway. I mean, that was really the bottom line. But the other thing is, I think because they... I don't' know... in working class life, age is not the same thing. I know twelve seems young, and I get that it's young, but my mother was married at fourteen. You know, so the assumption about how old you are and how you date, it just doesn't correlate in the same way. And I know that people relate that to trash to, you know, having no ability to protect your child and therefore they're on their own, and it's part of what's out of control about that culture. But I mostly think that you actually, you do grow up quickly when you have very little. And you know, people don't protest that you have to get a job when you're eleven, they protest that you're dating.\",\n",
       "  \"But there was a real, a real understanding that things left unseen, and unstated, and untold, the secrets of grief, shape history. And that if people could come forward and say what had happened to them, and confront the people who had hurt them, speak directly to them, it was a different... that was reconciliation. Not because those people could ever compensate them, but because they could face the people who had hurt them, and say that it was unjust. And I've always thought that political movements should spend more time thinking about frameworks that actually allowed us to both confront and reconcile grief with oppression. Especially in terms of class, in terms of things like sexism and violence, because the men that perpetuate, or the women that perpetuate either of those things, but mostly men, are also men you love. And so if we could find a way in our own movements, to both hold people accountable and still love them, I think we would build a different kind of movement, that could confront real powerlessness and real oppression differently, because we would not say to people that they had to choose not to love those people any longer in order to hold them to a standard of behavior that they did not match. And, you know, it's not a conversation we talk about. And yet, when I look at things like violence and incest and substance abuse and all of that kind of stuff, reconciliation and truth are precisely what you actually need to do, in order to be able to live with. How oppression turns you into an animal! I mean, give me a fucking break! Being poor, being hungry, being addicted, being violated yourself, being disrespected and hated, doesn't turn you into a nice person. And if we're ever going to, in the women's movement, come to terms with the way that we are hurt, and we hurt each other, it will be because we can actually have a different kind of dialogue that doesn't assume that I'll sue you or I'll imprison you.\",\n",
       "  \"Even though, I don't think my mother thought of leaving except at one point, early on, when she got in the women's movement, and I really think she did think of leaving, for awhile, for like, six months, then closed up that possibility. My dad, I think, always thought of leaving, but didn't have the guts. So he was constantly, as I was growing up, talking to me about other women, and you know, asked me at one point how I'd feel if he married my aunt... who he had dated before he married my mother. You know, incest stuff is like, very weird, in poor white trash ... ANDERSON: Where does that come from, for him? I mean, does that come from his family, the incest? Do you know? HOLLIBAUGH: Well, he, he... it is not, this is not what I know, so again. This was not, this was opaque in my family, but ... it was very clear that my dad was attracted to his mother, and his mother was attracted to him. It's also clear that Gypsy began to teach my father about sex when he was about five...brought women in for him, and maybe participated, it's never been quite clear to me what her role was, but clearly there was real stuff that went on between them, which then when my father married my mother really became a problem, because the sexuality wasn't just on Gyp's part, it was my dad, too. I mean, clearly there was a sexual current between them that was intense, and that my mother found appalling. And didn't want to participate in, and didn't approve of. And my dad then, was himself, somehow compromised I think, in his own sexuality when he was young, by his mother. Um, so, it much, very much fits the pattern. And he was pretty much sexually out of control all his life.\",\n",
       "  \"No. Or, we were very occasionally. My mother... so that was kind of the ending. But we had times when we were close and not close. My mother never believed me around the incest, and never, I think, could never afford to hear me. Because it would've changed in a fundamental way, her relationship to my father. However that would've worked out, she would've had to be willing to risk it in order to believe me. I told her when I was eleven; she didn't believe me then. I told her again when I was twenty, she didn't believe me then, and I, you know, blah, blah, blah. But around violence... my mother once said to me that the only thing she ever regretted about my childhood, of how she raised me as a kid, was that she, was so out of, so physically out of control. And that it was the one thing she felt like she really would change, if she ever could do anything differently again. That she knew she hit me a lot, she knew she really was wacky, in the way that she was out of control herself and that she really was sorry for it. So it was clear... and that was the end of that conversation, I mean, we never pursued beyond that.\",\n",
       "  'So again, I feel that feminism has played an essential role in the work that I\\'ve done and what it\\'s allowed me to do, but it\\'s also limited its own possibility of generating what I think it intrinsically could have done because of who it was afraid of allowing to enter its centrality of voice. If feminism as well as lesbian feminism is fundamentally a narrative of women\\'s stories that collectively generate ideology and theory and practice, then if [at] that center is absent women of color, working-class and poor women, women with an extraordinarily different set of sexual histories and class histories, then you don\\'t ... you don\\'t have at the center the majority of women\\'s lives. And that\\'s what feminism is missing, is the majority of women never joined that movement. And they didn\\'t join it because feminism was wrong, but because feminism had a bias in it about class and race. And by implication, then, about sex and homophobia. And it\\'s a tragedy to me that though there were many women like myself in that movement, including in places of relative power ... you know, I wasn\\'t a powerless foot soldier through that whole story, we were always marginal outsiders invited in, and then left out. Barbara Smith tells basically the same narrative. Cherrie tells the same narrative. Dorothy tells the same, Jewel tells the same. Because we were always both endlessly desired and profoundly worrisome voices to the way that the stories were being constructed and the way that the ideology flowed from the personal is political. Well, what personal? If poverty is as essential to the way you understand violation as incest, then a very different story gets told. If incarceration and racism is as fundamental to the identity that you have as a lesbian woman as any other piece of it, if you\\'re constantly having to pick, you know, Pat Parker really did say, you know, \"Some day I want to go to a party and bring my entire self.\"\\x9d And nobody did ever say it better than that. And the movement never allowed the totality of identities to merge in the way that the movement created its agenda and understood the world that it was functioning in. And therefore, it really limped, even though it was so powerful, even in spite of it, that it still had resonance for huge numbers of women.',\n",

I mean I actually, as a women's liberationist, I actually, you know, I've written about it. It was a crisis then and it was a crisis again after I broke up with my first butch lover. Because I ... the accusations and implications that surround you as a fem is that the reason you like masculinity is because you're actually straight. And that the reason you're not straight is because you don't want to deal with men or you had ... you've had a horrible experience with men, you're an incest survivor [laugh]. Your father didn't treat you well. Oh, God. And so, you know, you're trying to work it out by being with butch women. And I was really horrified that it looked to me like my desire for women and my particular kind of desire for butch women meant that I was betraying feminism. That I was betraying what I said I believed about power and powerlessness, about no roles about ... I mean, those things that I've tried to actually write about in resistance flooded me in the beginning and really ... I was really horrified at myself.\",\n",
       "  \"You know, if, if they lived their lives, basically embedded in that bitterness, that's their lives. It's not mine. I feel like, incest is a profoundly horrifying set of experiences, over time. Not just in terms of what it does to you when it's going on. It has enormous impact over the course of your life. And the only thing you control as an adult coming to terms with it, is how it will, how it will intersect with the way that you understand yourself and the way that you live your own life. You cannot guarantee that you will come to terms with it in, in relation to the perpetuator or the other parent, your siblings, any of those kinds of things. None of those things are the markers that you control. The only thing that you... as a feminist...really have, is the tool of understanding, trying to actually understand why something happened, and how you'll live with that history. What it will or will not do to you, the choices it does or doesn't influence, the way that you'll be yourself as an adult around a child. All of those are in your control. Beyond that, none of the rest of it is open to a singular understanding. And, so for me, I feel like, you know, I saw it rip our family apart over time. It ultimately meant that we could not stay united as a family because it couldn't be resolved. I think that's quite classic. I think in fact, all those stories that aren't the happy ending stories, very often end like that. With people never speaking again, people never seeing each other again. People never together agreeing on the nature of that history. And that you have to live with that. Because that, because that's not what you control. ANDERSON: Where did you find the tools?\",\n",
       "  \". I'd felt endlessly betrayed by women. I had been betrayed by my mother. You know, I mean, one of the things that I think never gets talked about in incest is ... not what the impact of incest is on you in relation to men as a woman, but what your relationship to other women is because women don't defend you when you're facing it as a girl-child. It is your mother t\\nat ... or your aunt or your cousin, girl-cousin ... that have to step in because it's not probably going to be a guy. And if women don't defend each other, then what does that mean about betrayal?\",\n",
       "  \"And I think sex exploded in the women's movement as kind of the ... I think sex was used ... the explosion around sex, I think, in the women's movement was the cover for class. Because I think it was, in talking about sex, you had to talk about lived experience, you had to talk about background and history. It couldn't be theoretical. It couldn't be only theoretical. And, I think that conversation made the divide between people from different kinds of histories and backgrounds very clear. And so a profound fight then broke out about sex that was embedded in the kind of direction feminism had gone in but it also, I think, was profoundly impacted by the way that class and desire ran under those conversations in the women's movement. Of what pornography was and who read it. Of pedophilia and the kind of the assumptions of, you know, pedophilia being about scuzzy men who were poor and slimy. I mean, those were all class assumptions, you know? Pedophilia was never about Harvard professors and, you know, blah-blah-blah-blah. And so, the assumptions then about class and sex, I think, really were embedded in the way feminism reacted to the challenge that different parts of the women's movement were facing, both from class and from race.\",\n",
       "  'would kind of be third... it would be an odd route. And my father actually called and left me a message saying he would be willing to go into family counseling. My father, I think actually... I mean, my father knew what he had done, and my father, I think, was willing to look at it. But my mother was not. And I think that was because my mother would have been to blame, too. That she had not protected me and she had not defended me and she had not, she had not challenged my father. She had not done those kind of things. Which is a real difference... if you look at Bastard Out of Carolina at least Dorothy\\'s mom didn\\'t think she was a liar. She didn\\'t leave the guy, but she didn\\'t think she was a liar. She tried to do what she could to protect her even though she was staying. My mother did not. My mother did something that I think is actually much more classic, which is that you claim the kid\\'s wrong, and then you connect and kind of identify with the other adult, and you form a unit against the kid\\'s exposure. And that\\'s basically what my mom did. And my dad, I think, when this all exploded, was willing to really look at it. I think he... he and I had had many confrontations about this, it\\'s not as though I hadn\\'t said it directly to him. But as long as my mother couldn\\'t tolerate this as a conversation in the family, there was no movement that he and I could do, really. And so it, really, it stayed at a moment where there was conversation, and then, they moved. And they cut everybody off and all of that. And I just decided, you know what?

Way more power in your life than it ever had the right to, and I, you know\"¦ ANDERSON: You just decided to be done',\n",
       "  \"disconnected from the politics that? HOLLIBAUGH: Well, here's what I felt like ... I mean, I had not started talking about incest until 1980 or '81 when I met Dorothy. I had quietly said to friends and lovers what had happened to me or some version of that although pretty caut\\nously. But again, in the women's movement when I would try to talk about my experience of incest, the class stuff was so sickening that I then ended up having to defend my father or my cousins or my uncle and say, or my mother, I ... so, when Dorothy and I met, and CherrÃƒÂ\\xadie was doing antiviolence work then, she was in New York and she was doing domestic violence work, I'm sure. And that was her job. And so Dorothy and CherrÃƒÂ\\xade and I would spend a lot of time talking about it. But Dorothy's who I first told the truth to, because Dorothy's life around that and my life around that were really quite similar although in different places, but equal ... not equally but in all the ways that people don't want to deal with the meaning of it, they were violent and transgressive and relentless and all of that stuff. And so it wasn't shameful to talk to her about my own history and so I could finally think about it and talk about it and we started doing a little bit of work around it with CherrÃƒÂ\\xade. We realized the class stuff was so bad that we couldn't figure out how to talk about without it instantly kind of sinking into a class discussion that we didn't have any tools for and that there was no markers around. So, people would ... felt completely free to comment on what they thought of your family. And I think parallel to that at the same time was the ... I don't even know how to say this, but the accelerating aspect of feminism that made your victim status the most relevant totality of your experience, that you never had a relationship to your own oppression, that you never had a complicated relationship to what was done to you, that you never participated in it in any way. In order to try to say that women had not been asking for rape or incest, we went to a place that was really dangerous. (cough) Do we need to stop? Anyway, the tragedy of the attempt to reclaim women's lives by making us victims so that we could assign responsibility where we thought we had been powerless, and so we could reclaim women's right to, you know, claim that they were raped even though they were married, or incested even though they had been provocative little girls, you know, all of that kind of stuff, I think, had a terrible ultimate impact on where feminism ended up. Kind of making its arguments for what happened to women and what you had to think about. And that became an impossible place for me. I mean, I just felt like, you know, it doesn't make it OK to say what my father did to me. I'm not saying it's OK that my father raped me by also saying that I was attracted to his hands, but I don't want to leave one piece of it out in order to also talk about the other. And in incest stuff, for me, I found it really difficult precisely because my father was the person that I was the closest to in my family, and the violation was extraordinarily twisted precisely because I'm most like him and he most held out for me in my family and so what happens ... what betrayal looks like when it also is connected to the very best that you ... that somebody brought to you of love and hope is not either you were a victim and they were a monster or you deserved it and they didn't know what they were doing\",\n",
       "  \"HOLLIBAUGH: I actually think it was all of those things. I mean I came through a movement, meaning the women's movement, that gave me the right to have that history without being ashamed. Because you do have terrible shame, I think, connected to it, and you do think that you participated in it. In fact, I actually think you do participate in it. This is a part of the feminist movement that, that I think we often haven't talked about enough, that in fact there's often... whether you desired incest or not, there's parts of desire that play into the sexuality that happens. My father's hands were some of the, were the most beautiful men's hands I'd ever seen. I know I desired his hands. Did I desire him to rape me? No, I did not. But there was a way that he has always been a sexual figure to me. Was that true when I was seven? Yeah. Was it true when I was eleven? Yeah. And so, you know, I don't like to leave myself out of my own history. Things didn't just happen to me as though I didn't have my own complex relationship to it. But feminism and the women's movement gave me a context to speak about and explore my own interior world and my own damaged history. And that is an extraordinary gift and I think actually the women's movement has given that to women, even though it's now kind of pop culture instead of politics, it still is a very different world to be, to be incested and to try and recover from incest than it was thirty years ago, or fifty years ago, like when my mother was trying to deal with all the stuff that she had gone through.\",\n",

Um, and if you look at the pictures in my book you can clearly see a shift in how old I look... and it clearly happened, that was really, really, really a big crisis... and there wasn't, you know, there's nothing you can do about it... your parents believe you or they don't believe you.

I wrote a review of Dorothy Allison\\'s Bastard Out of Carolina where I was not explicit about the incest in my family, but I said that I came from a family where incest was a part of that history, and that one of the things that was never talked about is what that did to women, between women. Not just between a woman and a man, or women and men, but women and women, because you never believed a woman would have your back if you were a, you know, a victim of incest, and you weren\\'t defended by the women in your family.

My mother never believed me around the incest, and never, I think, could never afford to hear me. Because it would\\'ve changed in a fundamental way, her relationship to my father. However that would\\'ve worked out, she would\\'ve had to be willing to risk it in order to believe me. I told her when I was eleven; she didn\\'t believe me then. I told her again when I was twenty, she didn\\'t believe me then, and I, you know, blah, blah, blah. But around violence... my mother once said to me that the only thing she ever regretted about my childhood, of how she raised me as a kid, was that she, was so out of, so physically out of control. And that it was the one thing she felt like she really would change, if she ever could do anything differently again. That she knew she hit me a lot, she knew she really was wacky, in the way that she was out of control herself and that she really was sorry for it. So it was clear... and that was the end of that conversation, I mean, we never pursued beyond that.',\n",
       "  'HOLLIBAUGH: That was for my parent\\'s benefit. And in that failing, as my life unraveled there, I also was in terrible conflict with my mother. I had told her about the incest and she had not supported me. I had started dating men that were much older, kind of in response to that. I was...and I was out a lot. I was out with girlfriends and boyfriends, I was fucking around, I wasn\\'t exactly having a lot of sex yet, but you wouldn\\'t have known that. I became a \"bad girl.\"\\x9d And that actually had never been true for me. I had been poor white trash or mixed race in the schools, and often considered other and not someone you wanted to be a friend with or take home, but I had been a straight-A student, I had been a \"good girlÃ\\nÂ€Â\\x9d in that sense. In high school, as I began to fail, I really came undone.',\n",
       "  \"HOLLIBAUGH: There were things we never talked about, like incest and things like that. But it wasn't that I wasn't telling her the truth, it's that those things were never talked about, by anybody, to anybody. ANDERSON: Was the abortion, for example, something that... HOLLIBAUGH: Oh no, absolutely, I talked to her about it. ANDERSON: The sex work was still a secret from your political friends at this point? HOLLIBAUGH: Yeah. I mean, she knew I had been a dancer in Vegas. She knew... if I told her about some part of my life, I told her the truth. But I didn't tell her about having been a sex worker.\",\n",
       "  \"HOLLIBAUGH: Well, here's what I felt like ... I mean, I had not started talking about incest until 1980 or '81 when I met Dorothy. I had quietly said to friends and lovers what had happened to me or some version of that although pretty caut\\nously. But again, in the women's movement when I would try to talk about my experience of incest, the class stuff was so sickening that I then ended up having to defend my father or my cousins or my uncle and say, or my mother, I ... so, when Dorothy and I met, and CherrÃƒÂ\\xadie was doing antiviolence work then, she was in New York and she was doing domestic violence work, I'm sure. And that was her job. And so Dorothy and CherrÃƒÂ\\xade and I would spend a lot of time talking about it. But Dorothy's who I first told the truth to, because Dorothy's life around that and my life around that were really quite similar although in different places, but equal ... not equally but in all the ways that people don't want to deal with the meaning of it, they were violent and transgressive and relentless and all of that stuff. And so it wasn't shameful to talk to her about my own history and so I could finally think about it and talk about it and we started doing a little bit of work around it with CherrÃƒÂ\\xade. We realized the class stuff was so bad that we couldn't figure out how to talk about without it instantly kind of sinking into a class discussion that we didn't have any tools for and that there was no markers around. So, people would ... felt completely free to comment on what they thought of your family. And I think parallel to that at the same time was the ... I don't even know how to say this, but the accelerating aspect of feminism that made your victim status the most relevant totality of your experience, that you never had a relationship to your own oppression, that you never had a complicated relationship to what was done to you, that you never participated in it in any way. In order to try to say that women had not been asking for rape or incest, we went to a place that was really dangerous. (cough) Do we need to stop? Anyway, the tragedy of the attempt to reclaim women's lives by making us victims so that we could assign responsibility where we thought we had been powerless, and so we could reclaim women's right to, you know, claim that they were raped even though they were married, or incested even though they had been provocative little girls, you know, all of that kind of stuff, I think, had a terrible ultimate impact on where feminism ended up. Kind of making its arguments for what happened to women and what you had to think about. And that became an impossible place for me. I mean, I just felt like, you know, it doesn't make it OK to say what my father did to me. I'm not saying it's OK that my father raped me by also saying that I was attracted to his hands, but I don't want to leave one piece of it out in order to also talk about the other. And in incest stuff, for me, I found it really difficult precisely because my father was the person that I was the closest to in my family, and the violation was extraordinarily twisted precisely because I'm most like him and he most held out for me in my family and so what happens ... what betrayal looks like when it also is connected to the very best that you ... that somebody brought to you of love and hope is not either you were a victim and they were a monster or you deserved it and they didn't know what they were doing. And I kept feeling like the world was now shrinking into a whole variety of ideological sides that flattened the power of feminism, to speak to and help women understand and move forward their own lives.\",\n",
       "  'I\\'d felt endlessly betrayed by women. I had been betrayed by my mother. You know, I mean, one of the things that I think never gets talked about in incest is ... not what the impact of incest is on you in relation to men as a woman, but what your relationship to other women is because women don\\'t defend you when you\\'re facing it as a girl-child. It is your mother t\\nat ... or your aunt or your cousin, girl-cousin ... that have to step in because it\\'s not probably going to be a guy. And if women don\\'t defend each other, then what does that mean about betrayal? You know, I always think it\\'s interesting, Bastard out of Carolina, that at least Dorothy\\'s mother never said to her, \"You\\'re lying.\"\\x9d She couldn\\'t finally defend her. She couldn\\'t protect her and stay with that man. But she never made Dorothy ... she never betrayed Dorothy in the sense of making Dorothy be wrong in order to excuse herself for the inability she had to protect her daughter. My mother exactly did one of those pieces that I think is extraordinarily horrifying, and that you don\\'t really ever get over, which is that she said very clearly, \"A man matters more than you and I will not risk my life for yours.\"\\x9d And that has lots of implications parentally, but it has an equal set of meanings for gender. And so to sit in a room with women who shared my politics and begin to talk about trying to make a vow that we would not betray each other, that we would not give each other\\'s lives up for any desire, be it sexual or ideological, was riveting. And it changed forever my relationship to other women, because it meant that ... I still think of that and use that as a marker in the way that I try to live my life. To not ever be willing to give a woman up, even if she\\'s willing to give herself up, and to always understand that women betray each other, and what that does to us in the ways that we never then value and trust each other and commit our lives to each other. Because committing your life to a woman whether you\\'re a dyke or you\\'re not a dyke is the hardest thing in this culture to do. To live your life for women rather than live your life for children or men, is to take a direction that\\'s unheard of for women. And some of it\\'s queer but some of it is gendered and I think, much bigger than whether you can come with a female lover.',\n",

In my commune! And so that was one of the first times that I had a confrontation with my father about incest. And said to him, \"I know what you fucking have done, and I know what you\\'re doing now, and mom doesn\\'t know it, and this is like, unacceptable, and if you want me to expose you, I will...

I\\'m telling the other parents what I\\'ve just heard about wha\\n was going on in the school yesterday.\"\\x9d So he said, \"Oh, you heard?\"\\x9d I said, \"Yes, I heard.\"\\x9d He said, \"That bitch!\"\\x9d And I said, \"Excuse me?\"\\x9d He said, \"She could have called us. The kid gave such a description of that man, we could have picked him up in no time because the kid gave such a good description of what the man looked like and what the man had on and what he smelled like.\"\\x9d He said, \"We\\'re furious.\"\\x9d I said, \"If you\\'re so mad, would you, please ... you\\'re in plain clothes ... would you please go walking around the school and see who stops you, and check all the doors, see if they\\'re all locked.\"\\x9d So he said, \"Well, you know, they have to be able to open them from the inside out.\"\\x9d I said, \"Yeah, but I want to know if they\\'re locked from the outside so the guy can\\'t get in. He got in somehow.\"\\x9d So he went around, and he said, \"Nobody stopped me. Half the people don\\'t know who I am. Some of the people know who I am.\"\\x9d Some of the administration knew him, but the average teacher didn\\'t know him. He said, \"Nobody stopped me.\"\\x9d Now this was the day after a very serious issue. So the parents ... we got together, and we said, Well, we\\'re going to have to stop everybody from going in the school. We discussed, What are we going to do? Finally we decided, Okay, we\\'re going to have armbands on all the teachers, and we\\'re going to tell the children they may not talk to anybody who doesn\\'t have an armband on. And if somebody doesn\\'t have an armband on, they should tell their teacher they saw somebody and give a description. And nobody can come in the building unless they agree to have an armband put on. Well, you know, you\\'d think this would be a perfectly reasonable solution. There were teachers who refused to put an armband on. \"I\\'m not going to wear something like that.\"\\x9d Well now, if it had been their child that was raped, wouldn\\'t they want to do something? We couldn\\'t think of anything to do without disrupting the educational program, but we thought this would be perfectly simple. Teach the kids somebody was hurt in the school and not everybody in the school should be in the school. So I learned about the stereotypes of ... A teacher doesn\\'t necessarily care about the children she\\'s teaching; a teacher doesn\\'t necessarily care about the issue. And so we ended up having to go to court because a few teachers pushed, shoved, accused us of pushing, shoving ... you know, got into a thing. Well, eventually the hearing officer, the judge, chastised the teachers for not doing what they should have been doing, and thanked us as parents for taking an interest. And that even annoyed me, because I thought, Why do you have a stereotype that parents wouldn\\'t have an interest in their children? But there are so many ingrown concerns that people have about other people and how they act or don\\'t act. And so we ended up closing the street, we ended up doing all kinds of things to have demonstrations, and finally they agreed to having somebody on patrol. Now, this isn\\'t now, where you have guns being looked at or security things going on with the children. This was a little seven-year-old girl, and nobody protected her and nobody said, We\\'re sorry. And she was whisked away, and she was sent to another school.',\n",

So in Philly, in those eight years, we were not in as many diverse communities as we could have been. I don't want to say we were just singing to the chorus, to the choir, but you know, there was a ground swell of people becoming feminists, becoming lesbian, becoming political in that time period. So, you know, in Philadelphia, whatever it was, there were two thousand people at the Take Back the Night rally. That's a fairly sizable number I think. And then concerts, I don't know, they said six hundred, and stuff like that. So that's a pretty good draw. So we performed for women's organizations. The same as in lots of cities, you perform in churches. Too bad they're not incredible musical performance halls that seat eight hundred or something like that. FOLLET: Right. ROMA: They're not, in most cities, that are available financially. FOLLET: Right. You've got two minutes. ROMA: Oh, OK. Well, I was aware that before I left, you know, we were going into more working-class areas and performing at settlement houses and things like that, people doing grassroots kind of work, and I think that was beginning to happen there when I was there. Otherwise I think it's progressive people, mainly, so in a sense singing to the choir. Maybe more women in the audiences then men, not necessarily so now in MUSE. Maybe more lesbians, feminist people in the audience, because it was that time. It was just, you know, so much was going on and our numbers seemed to be bigger, or people coming in to us are [from the] progressive community.

So in order to pay the debt, and also because, like many women, I think, I had always had a kind of rescue fantasy about Marilyn Monroe, in the sense that, had there been a women's movement, would she still be alive? So many things about her were like exaggerated versions of many women's experiences: being sexually abused as a child; being abandoned by her mom ... a single mom; abandoned first by her father; and certainly being treated as an object more than a person in many ways, especially before she became famous, but even afterward.

Did that translate to him, to you feeling afraid of your grandfather? Was he ever mean or abusive to the kids? VAZQUEZ: Yeah, because I think before that, we just sort of didn\\'t have much to do with him. We\\'d avoid him. He was, you know, the gruff guy, whatever. And after that, I was afraid of him. Forever. For the rest of my life. And actually, he ... there was an incident later in New York where he actually exposed himself to myself and my cousin Evie and, you know, we were, like, six years old or something like that. I mean, he didn\\'t do anything, but that\\'s terrible enough. But it was, you know, I really hated the man.',\n",

I know how to get the crowds going and I tell my women\\'s studies students that. So, I mean, I think maybe being a nonconformist or what have you had to do with the fact that on the one hand, I wanted to be popular, but I wasn\\'t. I wanted to be stereotypically attractive. I wanted a boyfriend. I wanted to do well in school. But on the other hand, there was something seething in me, and when I went away to this private school, I\\'d come back from a trip to Europe and I got into fights.

You know, the boys did not like me, and one time we had this co-ed hockey game and the boys came after me with the hockey sticks and I ended up smacking them, I mean, really fighting back.

       "  'share regarding this physician abuse? 110 Gartrell: [00:36:25] Yes. When I was a senior resident at Harvard, I spent half of my time at Harvard Student Health Services. I\\'d only seen very, very, very mentally ill patients [in my residency education at the state hospital]. I was interested in working with healthy lesbian and gay people and helping them with their [internalized] homophobia. Having a lot of expertise in how to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder and so on really wasn\\'t going to be helpful to me in terms of dealing with healthier people with run-of-the-mill problems. I wanted to work with healthier people. I applied for and was accepted for doing part of my senior residency at Harvard Student Health Services. My supervisor there was Paul Walters. It became clear to me that he was doing something that wasn\\'t okay while I was there. This was 1979. He was an analyst. He had a sofa in his office. It was a dark blue sofa. It had stains all over it. For supervision I met in there. I sat in the chair and when all the residents met in there, we sat all around. I always was trying to get the chair rather than the sofa. [I noticed that when he saw] patients, they seemed to stay for a very long period of time. It just felt creepy. Those were my observations. I started doing the research on sex abuse by psychiatrists. We had two people from Harvard School of Public Health whom we were working with, and through other people at the Harvard School of Public Health and my networking around Harvard, I met some people who worked at the Harvard Risk Management Foundation. I don\\'t know if that\\'s a concept that is familiar to people, in general, so I\\'ll just say something about it. Basically, they managed the malpractice claims that came 111 in against Harvard doctors, which meant they shoved them under the rug as much as possible or did payoffs that were private or confidential because nobody wanted bad publicity against Harvard doctors. [00:39:23] I heard from somebody I really trusted, who was a really straight arrow person who worked with the Risk Management Foundation, that a claim had come in against Paul Walters for sexually abusing a Harvard student, having her pay him thirty-five dollars a session, I think it was, for oral sex three times a week as therapy, [and it had somehow been \"taken care of\"\\x9d by the Risk Management Foundation]. I was already working on sex abuse. That individual said to me, \"If this comes to your attention in any other way\"\\x9d--because this was a breaking of a confidence as a person working with the Risk Management Foundation--\"you need to pursue it.\"\\x9d Before I left Harvard, I still had some friends who were on the staff at [Harvard Student] Mental Health Services where he still was. I said to them, \"If you hear anything about Paul Walters behaving sexually inappropriately with students, you need to let me know.\"\\x9d Before I left Harvard to move to California in 1987, he called me. Paul Walters, out of the blue. I had had no contact with him since 1979. Oh, [actually] I had. [Colleagues and I] had done a presentation at the American Psychiatric Association on sexual abuse of patients after we had published the first paper. He was there sitting in the front row. There were a whole collection of people [in that row]. I recognized him, but there were others that none of us recognized sitting in the first row of this huge auditorium. He called me after that and he said he wanted to let me know that he was leaving 112 his position at Harvard, and he was moving to California. Where? To Stanford to become the director of Cowell Student Health Services. I said, \"Oh, well, why are you telling me?\"\\x9d He said, \"Well, when I was out there, I mentioned that I knew you and that you were one of my supervisees and that you went to Stanford.\"\\x9d Now my work had already been publicized in a big way. I mean, front page stories in the Boston Globe, the sex abuse stuff--the results of the findings. It was clear he had used me in some kind of deceitful way to help get a position at Cowell Student Health Services. I left Harvard. Moved out here. The first year I was here, I got a call from one of the social workers who was still on the faculty at Harvard [Student Health] saying they got an anonymous letter from a woman who made the same claims--$35 an hour, da da da da da. I said, \"Thank you very much. I\\'m filing a complaint with the Massachusetts Licensing Board and the California Licensing Board. I\\'m going to inform them.\"\\x9d So I did. Both began a major investigation. The story became front page news out here and in Massachusetts. He left his position at Cowell Student Health Services. He claimed that he had a substance abuse problem, and he tried to get into a diversion program which, if you get in a diversion program, they drop all charges against you--it\\'s a nifty, sneaky loophole for perpetrators. Somehow there was enough publicity around it that they didn\\'t allow him into it. He went underground and was never found again. Every few years I got a call from a San Jose Mercury news reporter who was trying to find him; [the reporter] was pretty convinced that [Walters, who] was from North 113 Carolina, had gone back [there] and changed his name and was working [there]. I actually was very fearful that my name would come out as the person who reported him to the licensing board. All I had done [was to say], \"This has come to my attention. Please investigate and please contact the Harvard Risk Management Foundation and make sure you start your investigation there.\"\\x9d [00:44:40] When they did, the risk management people I guess were obligated to contact Patient A who then said, \"I\\'m willing to be named,\"\\x9d which was amazing. So I was never publicly [named] on any of the press about it, which I was very grateful about because I was afraid he was going to come [after me and] kill me--literally. I was afraid because we already knew that psychiatrists who took care of patients who\\'d been abused--women psychiatrists who took care of patients who had been abused--these were colleagues and friends of mine--had their offices broken into, their offices vandalized, and their records stolen because they were encouraging and supporting these women in filing complaints. The perpetrators were trying to stop the complaints from happening by attacking the subsequent treating women psychiatrists. These were scary times. I was afraid that this guy whose misdeeds I had reported, [resulting in a huge] impact on his career, was going to come after me. Fortunately, I was not [named] by the media but the Patient A contacted me and said, \"I don\\'t know how you found out but it\\'s [been] life-changing for me that you did--in a positive way--and I want to thank you so much for [having done] this.\"\\x9d When it was publicized in Boston, [she was] Patient A, [and subsequently] 114 Patient B, [and] Patient C [and] I don\\'t know how many [others] came forward and were willing to be named on the complaint. That\\'s one horror story. Another is the psychiatrist that my mother saw from the time she was psychiatrically hospitalized and for the next twenty-some years. He was a really creepy guy in Santa Barbara. He too became very prominent in psychiatry. He was president of the [World Association of Social Psychiatry]. His name was John Carleton. I sat outside the waiting room when she had appointments sometimes. As a teenager when I met him, he took my hand. He wanted to show me around the offices, and he kind of fondled my hand in a way that felt totally, totally cr\\nepy. I was a teenager who was already afraid of inappropriate behavior by men. I wanted to get my hand away, and he was fondling my hand so I was completely creeped out by this guy. I ran into him at some APA meetings, one of which when I was a resident. He got into an elevator and I was standing there with my residency training director at Harvard, and [Carleton] turned to me and he said, \"Well, hi, Nanette. How nice to see you. Your mother told me to say hello.\"\\x9d My mother was his patient. That is the most inappropriate thing in the world to say. That is a total breach of confidentiality. I walk out of the elevator, and my residency training director said, \"Who is he?\"\\x9d I said, \"My mother\\'s psychiatrist.\"\\x9d I mean, totally embarrassing to me that that had happened. I\\'d been doing [sex abuse] research. I was already out here. My mother called me a few years after I [moved to San Francisco]. It actually was in the early 1990s. I was working on a big fundraiser for our lesbian health services here 115 in San Francisco, and I had created an idea of a fundraiser that was really successful. I was driving back across the Golden Gate Bridge. It was a time when we had a car phone, and she called me. I said, \"I really can\\'t talk right now. I\\'m on the bridge.\"\\x9d She said, \"I have something I have to tell you. I know you\\'ve been doing all this work all this time [meaning, on sexual abuse] and I know that you never liked Dr. Carleton.\"\\x9d She wanted to tell me--she felt like she had to tell me--that she had been sexually involved with him and when she told him that the relationship needed to stop, he had raped her. She also said, \"He also encouraged me to kill your father.\"\\x9d I was just horrified at all this. \"He encouraged me when we went out sailing to push him overboard. That was before he raped me, before I told him I can\\'t keep seeing him.\"\\x9d [00:49:42] I contacted the California Licensing Board. He had meanwhile married a patient. I don\\'t know how many patients he--I think there were stories of multiple patients--I don\\'t know how many he married, but he married at least one. The only thing I could think of to do was to contact, again, the California Licensing Board, and I sent them this complaint. I asked my mother if she\\'d be willing to be named on the complaint. I don\\'t remember the circumstances exactly. She had gone through this complicated decision-making process but I said to them, \"You\\'ve got to open a file on him. If you get any other complaints, you really need to do something about it.\"\\x9d 116 The third story led to my resignation publicly from the American Psychiatric Association in 1989, during the time that all these women psychiatrists and mental health professionals were providing reparative, supportive therapy to victims of abuse by male typically psychiatrists and other physicians. The APA\\'s malpractice carrier was beginning to realize that they were going to be losing tons of money on these claims. This is before we started our work in this area. They were paying claims based on sexual abuse. Now you can\\'t get any kind of insurance--malpractice coverage--that would cover your sexually abusing a patient. Then they were paying. One of the things that was really a problem for them is that subsequent treating psychiatrists were helping these patients file complaints, which means that the claims were continuing to rise and they were continuing to lose money. They started going after these subsequent treating psychiatrists with character assassination. One of those cases involved this phenomenally strong woman psychiatrist in Colorado whose name is Martha Gay. She was treating a patient who had been sexually abused by a psychiatrist. The establishment came after Martha Gay to character assassinate her and further character assassinate the patient who had filed a claim against her abusing [male] psychiatrist. It was an appalling situation. I went all in in support of Dr. Gay, and I publicly resigned from the APA over the [attempt to malign her character]. That story ended up being a FRONTLINE documentary. I talked about that resignation in the FRONTLINE documentary. Those are just some examples, [and that episode illustrated how one] moved 117 into very dangerous territory [when] working with individuals who were seeking restitution from abuse.',\n",
       "  'Can we talk a little bit about that now? Gartrell: [00:16:41] Yes, when I became chair of the Committee on Women, my understanding of the responsibility was--this was 1982--to advocate for women\\'s mental health on a national basis. So that if there was a problem related to women\\'s mental health, it was the responsibility of the Committee on Women to figure it out and do something about it. Very soon after I assumed the position, I heard that the number of malpractice claims filed against psychiatrists through the American Psychiatric Association\\'s insurance carrier --they had an insurance carrier at that time--based on allegations of sexual abuse of the patient, were skyrocketing. At that time, we were coming off the 1960s and 1970s, the free love era, [aka] anything goes. There were no ethics codes. There were no licensing board regulations. There were no laws about this. For me and for those on 102 my committee, it was a no-brainer. Your patients are not there for you to have sex with. Your patients come to you because they have psychological difficulties for which they need help. We started looking into this, and we were getting more and more information about this as a potential problem but by then, I was already quite wise to the fact that the APA was [laughter] an institution in which there was a tremendous amount of resistance to change and that it seemed unlikely that we could do anything about the problem that we were hearing about until we had evidence documenting it. I proposed that we put together a questionnaire, and get the APA to agree to send it out to all the psychiatrists in the country and do it in a neutral fashion because, again, there were no ethics codes, there were no laws, there were no licensing board regulations. With nothing in place saying it\\'s not a bad thing, you could just ask the questions in a neutral way and maybe people would answer the questions. Have you been sexually involved with a patient? If you have, how long did the relationship last? Is it still ongoing? Questions like that and then we got a little further into it. Have you been involved with more than one patient? How many patients have you been with and can you tell us how many patients you\\'ve been involved with? We put together this questionnaire. We submitted it through the channels, and we were stonewalled by committee after committee after committee that was responsible for approving projects like this. [We were] starting to get accusations like, \"What [are you] trying to do? [You are] going to destroy the credibility of the psychiatric profession.\"\\x9d We were going to destroy the credibility of the 103 psychiatric profession? To us, it seemed as though psychiatrists who were sexually abusing their patients were destroying the credibility of the psychiatric profession. We continued to push forward and said we didn\\'t agree and we wanted to do this survey and we wanted the APA to sponsor it. At a certain point, it became clear that it was re-cycling back through the same committees that had already rejected it. I had brought onto the Committee on Women, Judith Herman, who\\'s my really good friend and colleague, and Silvia Olarte, another psychiatrist. There were other members of the committee who were very much in support of this project. [00:20:54] We decided we would give the APA a deadline. If they didn\\'t approve the project by this deadline, we would do the study ourselves independently. They actually didn\\'t imagine that I could get the mailing labels in order to send out the questionnaire to psychiatrists in the country because this was--again--before everyone had computers in their homes, and they owned the mailing labels for the Psychiatric Association. I don\\'t know how they printed them out when they needed them--I don\\'t remember whether they printed envelopes or labels or what they had. They just figured they\\'d let the deadline pass and that it was a false statement on my part that I could actually do it independently. But what they didn\\'t know is while we were waiting for the deadline, first of all, I\\'d contacted two individuals at the Harvard School of Public Health about doing the statistics. And that continuing medical education was beginning to be a booming and profitable industry. So we were starting to get mailings about continuing medical 104 education courses. They were coming through the AMA. I was never a member of the AMA because--talk about organizations that were never progressive enough for me--that was certainly one of them! The AMA was located in Chicago. I contacted the Harvard Continuing Medical Education Office, and I said, \"When you\\'re sending out CME courses, how do you get your mailing labels? Do you have your own?\"\\x9d They said, \"No, no, we get them through a clearinghouse through the AMA in Chicago.\"\\x9d And they gave me the number. I already had plans to conduct a course on ethics in medicine and in psychiatry and so I had already been kind of thinking along these lines. I contacted this clearinghouse, and I said, \"I\\'m a Harvard faculty member and I\\'m planning to do this course and how would I obtain mailing labels?\"\\x9d I [also asked], \"How many do you have for psychiatrists?\"\\x9d I think they had 25,000 or something. I said, \"And how much would that cost?\"\\x9d It was very expensive. Every study that I\\'ve done, I\\'ve essentially funded myself out of my own earnings. I said, \"Well, could you randomly select every fifth psychiatrist in the country, and how much would that cost?\"\\x9d And they said, \"Oh yes, it\\'s not a problem.\"\\x9d That was several thousand dollars, but I was willing to pay for it. They said, \"We\\'ll give them to you zip code sequenced, which, as it turned out, is a very big deal because when you\\'re taking things in bulk to the post office, which I did not know previously, you have to put them in bags [that are] zip code sequenced. I got all those arrangements made. The deadline came and passed. I contacted the clearinghouse. I got the labels 105 shipped to me; again, sitting on the floor--always I was seemingly [sitting] on hardwood floors stuffing envelopes after printing out questionnaires. [00:24:16] We had thankfully moved away from mimeograph into being able to have Xerox copies back then. [I spent days] stuffing these envelopes, putting stamps on them, getting them to the post office. We sent them out to every fifth psychiatrist in the country. Officials at the APA went ballistic when some of them received this questionnaire. They thought I had broken into the APA and stolen the labels, gotten into the office and stolen the labels! They had no idea that I could possibly do this without breaking in. I assured them that I had a plan to conduct a course based on the results of the study. They were just apoplectic about this. We got the questionnaires back. We also got some that said things like, \"We believe you have secretly coded these questionnaires, and there is no circumstance in which I would fill it out because I believe you can identify us.\"\\x9d We received back a lot of obscenities and very hostile comments. Leaving aside the obscenities and the blank questionnaires that they sent back that we had to pay the postage on, of course, because they often stuffed them with heavy things so we had to pay more postage, we tabulated our results. Seven percent of psychiatrists acknowledged being sexually involved with their patients and a number of those had been involved with more than one patient. All our publications are available to be read so I\\'m not going to go into details of numbers. They can be downloaded also--many of them--on our study websites. We then had the issue of publishing the article. The preeminent journal of psychiatry is the American Psychiatric 106 Association\\'s journal, the American Journal of Psychiatry. The editor of that journal was none other than my department chair who wanted me not to use my hospital affiliation and my Harvard affiliation on any of my publications. They did not have anonymous review, of course. One of the things I\\'d worked on for years was to get medical journals to have anonymous review because all the data that we had showed that if even a single woman was a co-author, the chance of an article being accepted was reduced. We wrote up the first paper and submitted it to the American Journal of Psychiatry. It\\'s standard to send out a manuscript to two reviewers, sometimes three reviewers. He sent it out to seven simultaneous reviewers. We got seven pages-long criticisms of us--not of the study--nothing about the analysis or anything about the legitimacy of the actual research itself. We sat down and typed up [our responses], dutifully responding to every criticism. The one that was most entertaining to us--\"These data could not possibly be accurate. There\\'s no way that they could be accurate.\"\\x9d To that one, we responded, \"We completely agree with you. These data are not accurate. They can\\'t even begin to be accurate because they inevitably underrepresent the prevalence of this abuse.\"\\x9d They weren\\'t prepared for that [laughter]. My final statement in our very long, many-page response to these criticisms [that was sent] back to the editor of the journal who happened to be my department chair was, \"We understand if the reviewers and you make a decision that you do not want to publish it, but it\\'s important to let you know that the American Psychological Association\\'s journal has expressed an interest in publishing this article.\"\\x9d Which [would] essentially [be] letting the 107 competitor put out the information about psychiatry. I mean, I didn\\'t say that but that was obvious. Very reluctantly it was published [in the American Journal of Psychiatry]. [00:28:57] We then did a number of follow-up studies including studying senior residents--all senior residents--in terms of their sexual involvement with patients and already there were some who were sexually involved with patients. I heard endlessly from psychiatrists, \"Why don\\'t you survey the other specialties? OB/GYNs, surgeons, family practitioners, internists? Surely they\\'re sexually involved with patients too,\"\\x9d as if that justified a\\nything. When I [joined the UCSF faculty], I gathered colleagues in other fields and, in fact, we did that study too. And, in fact, found [that], yes, indeed, [physicians in other specialties were abusing patients too]. Also from their own assessment of the impact on patients who had been sexually involved with non-psychiatric physicians whom they knew of, that the consequences were always damaging to the patients. We knew from data we had been gathering over the [prior] decade that most patients who were abused by psychiatrists [or other mental health professionals] ended up severely depressed when the relationships terminated, which they did inevitably. Ten percent were psychiatrically hospitalized and one percent committed suicide. We even had people write in things on their questionnaires like, \"You know, I\\'m not really sure that this involvement is worth the effort. This patient was terribly dysfunctional to begin with and things just got worse after the sexual involvement so I\\'m not really sure that this is something that I\\'m going to continue.\"\\x9d This is what we 108 were dealing with. The point of all of this was we had a mission, a mission to establish ethics codes, to have licensing board regulations that made it very clear that sexual involvement with any patient was unacceptable. Our mission [encompassed] any current or former patient. We don\\'t have that in all the regulations, but it has also become a felony in many states. And there are reporting regulations in some states that if you, as a medical professional, hear of another colleague who is involved with a patient, however you hear about it, you\\'re required to report it to the licensing board. We have had a great impact in terms of change. It was a hard-fought battle and a really important one from my perspective, in thinking about the vast number of patients who were severely damaged--[creating] what we call an iatrogenic problem--caused by a medical intervention, which [in this case] was an abuse. Marine-Street: That\\'s just incredible to me that it wasn\\'t part of the code of ethics. When did it finally get into the code of ethics? Do you know? Gartrell: [00:32:00] There were a lot of different changes to the ethics codes, and it\\'s now in the AMA Codes of Ethics. It wasn\\'t part of academic codes of ethics-faculty/students--either. This is all the result of the work that we did in this area [first in] psychiatry and then [in] medicine that it became something that was then [considered] in academia [concerning] faculty and students. I mean, you know, the whole concept of \"they\\'re both adults, it\\'s freedom of choice, it\\'s a consensual relationship\"\\x9d--in medicine, we know what informed consent means and I have said this very clearly since I began this work. Informed consent means you explain the risks and benefits of any [proposed treatment 109 or intervention]. I can assure you there\\'s never been an abusing physician who has explained that \"you have a fifty percent chance of a severe depression, ten percent chance of psychiatric hospitalization, one percent chance of committing suicide as a result of this--your imminent sexual involvement with me. [So] let\\'s go meet at the Holiday Inn.\"\\x9d I mean, does that sound likely? No. Faculty/student involvement, I mean, [it\\'s important to think about] who [holds the power]. We\\'ve talked about the all-male or predominately male academic institutions in which I grew up. Many of those individuals themselves likely were either aware of or themselves participating in the abuse of power that we [now] know was rampant. Marine-Street: Just the fact that someone would actually be truthful on the questionnaire and return it to you would seem to indicate that there was some degree of acceptance. Gartrell: [00:34:07] Acceptance because we were just coming off the free love movement when it was [considered] okay. In fact, when I was at Stanford, for classmates who got involved with faculty members, that was a badge of honor for them because what did they get out of it? They had a ticket to opportunity, for a time. Marine-Street: Was that frequent when you were at Stanford? Gartrell: [00:34:35] I know of circumstances. Frequency--I would not be surprised if it were frequent, but my mission was to get us out of the DSM back then.',\n",
       "  'Gartrell: [00:37:33] I\\'ll say something about encounter groups. The summer before we entered Stanford, to my knowledge, every one of us received a letter offering the opportunity to participate in an encounter group when we arrived. It was described as an opportunity to have a member of the Counseling and Testing Center meet with a small group of us to talk about our experiences and to get to know one another well and share things that we might not feel comfortable sharing just in general. But, you know, in a safe environment. I read it. My parents read it. At first I thought, \"Why not, it sounds good.\"\\x9d My parents read it and thought, \"Oh, wow, free therapy. Great. So do it.\"\\x9d I signed up to do it and we met. In my group, for some strange reason, my RA who happened to become my lover was in my group but there were no other women. There were about five other men and then we had a male who was a member of the 32 Counseling and Testing Center staff running the group. We met in Escondido--in one of the Escondido apartments--I don\\'t know if they\\'re still called Escondido Apartments. Are they still called that? The tall buildings that are across from the firehouse. Marine-Street: I think they are--Escondido, yes. They\\'re doing a lot of reconstruction up there right now. Gartrell: [00:39:00] I know. Everything\\'s changing. There were apartments that senior students could live in. So two women who were seniors lived there, and they allowed us to use their apartment. It was clear from the very beginning that the conversations were going in the direction of sex and talking about sexual feelings and that was something that seemed to be thrilling to the men to be able to do and felt creepy to me. Early into these meetings, we were told to pair off and there were all those kinds of touchy-feely things that were done back then in group dynamics where you close your eyes and, you know, see what you can communicate to another person through holding their hands like this and things like that. That kind of pairing off, we were given some instructions about that. I found out later that the woman who became my lover, my RA, and the man she was paired off with--what he did was he reached around, undid her bra, and was feeling her breasts during that encounter. That made me feel incredibly freaked out. She didn\\'t complain. She just went along with it. She was sexually involved with men before she became involved with me. I guess, I don\\'t know, some number of sessions later, we arrived and the group leader was on the couch holding the hands and stroking one of the women 33 who lived in the apartment. He said, \"Well, let\\'s resume later.\"\\x9d She went into the bedroom, and we started our meeting and he stopped it after, I don\\'t know, five or ten minutes. And he said, \"You know, I have some unfinished business to do with what\\'s-her-name and so why don\\'t you carry on without me.\"\\x9d We kind of, I don\\'t know, carried on somehow without him. I had to go to the bathroom, and I got up to go to the bathroom, and the door to the room was open and they were having sex. And I, from other women classmates, heard similar stories of power and sex abuse by these people who supposedly represented mental health professionals affiliated with Stanford, which was just appalling. Marine-Street: Was he a student? Gartrell: [00:41:43] No, he was a member of the Counseling and Testing Center staff in the Dean of Students Office at the Old Union. Marine-Street: The girl that he was having sex with was an older student? Gartrell: [00:41:55] Student, yes. She was a senior. Marine-Street: But an undergraduate? Gartrell: [00:41:57] Yes. Marine-Street: Well that\\'s an encounter group I guess. Gartrell: [00:42:01] Yes, that\\'s an encounter of a sort. Marine-Street: Yes, of a sort. Anything else on that topic? You wrote somewhere that it was \"an environment of daily sexual harassment\"\\x9d during that time. Gartrell: [00:42:14] Yes. It was. Another illustration of the kind of commentary that was just routine and so irritating when it happened was initially when I got there, I guess miniskirts weren\\'t in fashion yet, but they kind of became in 34 fashion. I wore skirts and shorts. I wore a lot of shorts while it was hot and then I wore skirts some of the time. Actually, they were culotte skirts so that they were kind of like shorts. And my skirts got somewhat shorter as time went on because that was the fashion. I happened to generally make my own clothes because we didn\\'t have the money to buy them. As I came out and became involved in--or had much more awareness of--feminism and got really excited about the beginning of the second wave of feminism, I started changing my clothing style and wearing clothes that were comfortable, not clothes that attracted attention from men. Because my short skirts--well, I mean, I figured all women attracted attention from men--but I felt that the way I dressed attracted attention and it was unwanted attention. I started wearing comfortable clothes that felt so good and so safe. That included overalls and turtlenecks when it was cold. One of my classmates said to me, after I had started wearing these clothes, turned over to me before our class started and said, \"You know I liked you a lot better when you were wearing miniskirts. You really look terrible in overalls.\"\\x9d Marine-Street: This is a male classmate? Gartrell: [00:44:26] A male classmate. Marine-Street: How did you respond? Do you remember? Gartrell: [00:44:29] I just looked kind of horrified and I felt just invaded, and I felt it was an indication of this kind of entitlement to dictate the clothing of a classmate and very aware of the difference in my feeling of safety wearing overalls and a turtleneck versus a short skirt.',\n",
       "  '. My work related to sex abuse by physicians led to my decision to give a talk in I believe it was 1992 or 1993 at Women in Medicine on ethics and boundaries for lesbian physicians because we already knew from data that had been gathered that female-female cases were the second highest percentage of reported abuse cases. The majority were male physician/male therapist-female patient. Going way, way, way, way down in the percentages but the next highest category--thirteen percent of cases--were female-female. I knew of cases. They had come to my attention. They were just as abusive and just as damaging to the patient as any other case of abuse. I stood up in front of this group, and I talked about why we needed ethics codes and why we needed to be just as vigilant in our own community as we expect our male colleagues to be in the community of physicians. Then I gave case example after case example which were, I think, really eyeopening and horrifying to members of the audience. I was asked to repeat that [presentation] or do an updated version of that presentation this year. I was asked actually before the #MeToo movement started. The #MeToo 98 movement became the backdrop of the talk that I just presented a few weeks ago. When the Q&A happened at this talk, lesbian physician after lesbian physician stood up who had been there in the first talk and said, \"I remember when you gave your first talk. It was eye-opening for me. It changed the way I practiced. It changed the way I understood the dynamics of power abuse. One of the messages that you\\'ve said very clearly is that we, as women, very often think we don\\'t have the power to abuse but, in fact, we do. I learned that from you then, and I hope you young people here learn that again or learn that for the first time from her today.\"\\x9d That was one example of a very radical presentation in my own group that was already a radical group.',\n",
       "  'wonder if you\\'d be willing to just talk a little bit about those. Gartrell: [00:04:30] When I was six years old, we lived next door to a physician who had three sons. One of them was a teenager. He and a friend of his lured me and my brother over to their treehouse and said, \"Wouldn\\'t you like to come see our treehouse?\"\\x9d He said, \"You go up first\" to me and I started climbing, and I said, \"Come on, Greg\" [to my brother]. And he [the neighbor] said, \"No, no, you wait down there.\"\\x9d They wouldn\\'t let him up. They got me up there, and they had a .22 rifle and they pointed the rifle at me and demanded that I engage in sexual activity with them, which I don\\'t think there\\'s a point in describing, but it was phenomenally traumatic. I thought that they were going to kill me, and they threatened to come get me if I told anyone. What happened afterwards was I got down, and I burst into tears and ran to my home. My mother and father were both home at the time. My father examined me physically, which was further embarrassing, and then went over and screamed at the neighbors and told them he was calling the police. Then they consulted--I don\\'t know whom--who said that it would be very traumatic for me to go to court to testify against these boys, and it was better just to leave [it as it was, with] whatever threat my father made against them. We lived in that house for another year and a half. I was terrified every single day. I was terrified every single night. I was afraid they were going to crawl into my window. I actually was terrified throughout the rest of my childhood about the prospect of being raped or assaulted after that incident. Marine-Street: Were there any ramifications for the assaulters? Gartrell: [00:06:35] None whatsoever. When we moved to a new home far across town from where they lived, there was an unfortunate response on my mothers part to a question I asked in a veiled way, hoping that it wouldn\\'t be obvious why I was asking the question. I said to her, \"Do you think there\\'s any chance those neighbors know where we live now?\"\\x9d She said, \"Oh, of course, I\\'m sure they know,\"\\x9d which just took away any feeling of safety that I could have had at this new home. Marine-Street: Did you get any kind of counseling or help? Gartrell: [00:07:13] No. 18 Marine-Street: What did they call what happened to you in those days? Gartrell: [00:07:22] Teenage boys acting badly. Marine-Street: Has your understanding of that changed over time? Gartrell: [00:07:32] It was sexual violence at gunpoint and very, very, very traumatic. Marine-Street: You also mentioned to me that you almost were kidnapped. Was that about that same time? Gartrell: [00:07:48] It was a few years later. We lived next to a lemon orchard. Our house backed up against the lemon orchard. We were not a family of means. We lived in a small track house in Santa Barbara. Our school bus dropped us off about, I would say, a fifteen-minute walk from my home. I had seen a car that followed the school bus frequently, and it was an old man driving an old car. On most days when we were dropped off, there were many of us children. On this particular day, I was the only one. I got off the bus, and I was walking in a fairly leisurely way next to the lemon orchard to my home. This car pulled up next to me, and he rolled down his window, and he said, \"You need to get in. You need to get in.\"\\x9d He looked very frightening to me, and I started running, and he started following me. There was enough room where he could follow me off the road. I started screaming and running, and I ran through the lemon orchard [so] he couldn\\'t take his car through the lemon orchard. I got into my house the back way and went into my room and looked out the window, and I saw that he was cruising by trying to find me. I told my parents. They then called the police and they allegedly looked for this person, but I [often] saw the car [parked] within a mile of our home and no one ever apprehended 19 the person. It was another instance in which, again, there was a complete lack of feeling safe. Marine-Street: What did you do as a child after those instances to kind of make yourself feel safe? Gartrell: [00:09:57] I didn\\'t feel safe. I felt frightened all the time. I felt frightened in my home, outside of my home. I was always afraid of being raped. I was always afraid of being assaulted. Marine-Street: How can you function if you\\'re always afraid? Gartrell: [00:10:12] There are a lot of things that contributed to fear in my life and my parents unfortunately were not psychologically healthy. There was major mental illness in my family so I had that factor contributing to my state of not feeling safe. My father had severe panic disorder, and he was pretty much afraid of the world and afraid of going anywhere. When you have a role model of one parent who is afraid of the world and another parent who was quite mentally ill in a different way, it\\'s not an environment in which a child grows up being given an opportunity to feel safe. On top of that, I then had teachers who hit on me before I left for college. For instance, when I was a tenth grade student, I had a Latin teacher who said to me he wanted to start driving me home. I thought that I needed to comply with that, [but when I] told my father and mother, they said, \"Well, he can come here and meet us, but he\\'s not driving you home.\" He touched me in ways that were very creepy. Touched my body and his hands were not where they should be. I mean, here I was doing well academically and having somebody trying to paw me and trying to drive me home.',\n",
       "  \"parting thoughts as we conclude this interview today? Gartrell: [00:23:53] I guess I would say that my entire career has been one in which the personal is the political. Even most recently, the great fear that a person who demonstrates signs of mental instability has access to the nuclear codes made it very clear that there was great urgency to try to protect the planet. But long before that, my goals were to make this world a better and safer place and provide civil rights for LGBT people. That has been a mission throughout my career and will continue to be. [My sex abuse work became a parallel track]--also more than a decade's worth of work--because I just happened to fall into some knowledge about [physician] abuse of patients and power abuse. That [line of work] became a very big theme in my life. And it recurs now as we're in the #MeToo movement. [All around us] we see the 129 incredibly positive changes that are occurring as women are speaking out about abuse. My interview began with your questions about my experiences of abuse as a child. At one point you asked how did I get through those experiences and manage to keep on going. I have to say that I don't think anybody who has gone through abuse could probably answer the question of why we made it to the next step other than at first, we're [just] trying to survive. And then [of course it's incredibly fortunate] if we can garner resources, [perhaps] have the privilege and the good fortune of having something like a Stanford education with access to really smart and talented people, and [then take a] look around at movement activists who have the strength and [talent to] create communities to make changes and work for social justice. I've had the privilege of knowing amazing community activists who have created phenomenal change and [forged] paths to so much social justice in our world. I have simply been trying to do my part in the dimensions that are within my area of expertise.\",\n",
       "  'something that happened then? Gartrell: [00:49:00] Yes, we were told periodically about rapes that happened and women being assaulted outside our dorm. This was starting our first year at Stanford. The lighting was very poor. Our bikes were parked in really dim lighting. I already came to Stanford as a frightened person--worrying about assault and violence. This was not helpful to me at all. We did, as our peer group of women, talk about our fears of going to the library at night. I was petrified of going to the library at night because it involved going out to get my bike where it was dimly lit, where anyone could be grabbed, riding my bike through dark streets to the library, and at both of those places locking the 37 bike. All of these things, if there\\'s nobody else around, made me quite vulnerable and then being in the library, studying until whatever hour, and then making my way back. I was petrified. I mean, from the moment I left the dorm I was petrified. The whole process of thinking about going to the library made me petrified, which meant that I didn\\'t go as often as I wanted to or needed to, which meant that I felt that my [education suffered]. Well, I mean, it was my choice about safety or my fears about safety that prevented me from making adequate uses of the library. At that time, there were no [alarm boxes]. I know now that it seems like every twenty feet, there\\'s an alarm box and I also know that there is [00:50:53] a lot of attention to safety. I\\'m not talking about the kind of safety that involves drinking alcohol and saying no. I\\'m talking about just trying to go to the library or trying to go to a night class. I mean, there were things that were happening at night that unless I was going as a member of a group, it didn\\'t feel safe attending. Marine-Street: Did you and any of the other women students do anything to try to feel more safe? Gartrell: [00:51:25] No, we just didn\\'t feel safe and--I mean, it didn\\'t occur to us that we had an opportunity to do anything. Marine-Street: Was there any kind of like self-defense courses or anything? Gartrell: [00:51:37] I don\\'t remember what year it was, but I think it was probably my senior year that a self-defense course was offered, not as an elective but just as a campus activity, and I took it. I found out about it however--going to school at a time when there was no internet, any information you received 38 was word-of-mouth, you happened to have the time to read a flyer in White Plaza, or you happened to have time to read the Stanford Daily, or you had access to the Daily regularly, which I didn\\'t always, especially if I was living off-campus. It was really a matter of luck if you found out about something that you really wanted to do and needed to do. But somehow I found out about it. I attended this class and I loved it. I loved the concept of being taught that I was entitled to pay attention to my fears and that whenever I did feel afraid--whenever something happened that made me feel more afraid--I should pay attention to my feelings because they were a good indicator of my potential risk. My lover who had sex with men before she met me, [and] had sex with men throughout the time she was with me--she was not comfortable being lesbian, didn\\'t want to identify as lesbian, wanted to get married, [and] spent the whole time that I was at Stanford looking for a man to marry at the same time she was involved with me--always said, \"Oh, you\\'re just a wimp, you know, stop being so afraid. What are you so afraid of? You\\'re so afraid of sex with men? Why are you so uptight? You\\'re just incredibly uptight?\"\\x9d Always the message, \"You are really, really uptight.\"\\x9d To have this validation in this self-defense class that paying attention to [my feeling of fear]--granted, I came from a background of more fear that I carried within me than I wish I ever did--but that if something kicked it up to a higher level, that my feelings were valid and I needed to pay attention to them and I needed to do something about them immediately. Then to learn self-defense techniques to fight or to fight back or to release myself was 39 fabulous. It was such an incredible opportunity to have--to create a sense of empowerment. Marine-Street: Was it a male instructor, do you remember? Gartrell: [00:54:27] Absolutely not. It was all women. Marine-Street: All women? Gartrell: [00:54:29] Yes, I wouldn\\'t have taken a course from a man because how could a man possibly have come from our experience and seen the world in the way we saw the world? Marine-Street: It was another student that was doing it? Do you recall? Gartrell: [00:54:45] Yes, I believe it was another student or somebody from offcampus who came. Marine-Street: Do you remember where they taught the classes? Gartrell: [00:54:52] They were taught in the Roble Gym. Marine-Street: Does anything stick with you about what they taught you like specific techniques? Gartrell: [00:55:03] They were techniques about releasing yourself if someone grabs you and there were techniques about the most vulnerable [ways] to fight back if you were assaulted. I go from that, fast forward to many years later when I got to know Pauline Bart who was a very eloquent writer about rape and women fighting back. She did studies about women who were trained to or learned to fight back versus women who were trained to lie down and take it. I had heard always growing up that if you\\'re assaulted; you\\'re going to be killed if you fight back--until I took this class. 40 When I got to Pauline Bart\\'s readings and then got to know her as a colleague and heard that there were actual data that the women who fought back, very often, got away and were not raped versus those who submitted were a hundred percent raped. There was no guarantee they weren\\'t going to be killed. It was an incredibly eye-opening experience. Marine-Street: I\\'ll say. Let\\'s take a quick break. Gartrell: [00:56:29] Okay. [End of Part 1 of 5 - Interview with Nanette Gartrell - August 29, 2018] 41 42 STANFORD UNIVERSITY PROJECT: STANFORD PIONEERING WOMEN ALUMNAE ORAL HISTORY PROJECT INTERVIEWEE: NANETTE GARTRELL INTERVIEWER: NATALIE MARINE-STREET DATE OF INTERVIEW: AUGUST 29, 2018 PART: 2 OF 5 Marine-Street: Before we move on, is there anything else you\\'d like to say about the selfdefense course? Gartrell: [00:00:06] One other thing that just came to mind is in Pauline Bart\\'s research about lying down and taking it versus fighting back--and fighting back included using strategies to extract yourself. There were accounts that she provided of women who actually talked men who had weapons out of their weapons and then managed to escape without being assaulted. It\\'s really quite phenomenal but not only did she find that if you do fight back or use a strategy to escape that you have a chance of not being sexually violated. But even if you were raped and you fought back, that the psychological sequelae for those who resisted versus those who didn\\'t was dramatically different. That is fascinating. That was always fascinating to me. The fighters ultimately did better than those who thought that they had to comply and didn\\'t try any strategies. Not that they\\'re to be blamed-those who are to be blamed are the police and the men who told us, \"Don\\'t 43 resist, don\\'t resist.\"\\x9d They are to be blamed, and I have strong feelings about that.',\n",
       "  \"If he had a difference of opinion, he didn't share it with me, and he never tried to stop me from speaking out. That is an incredible thing. I mean here was a man who had the potential to use--he came from a very privileged background--his patriarchal power in a way that would be all about conformity, and he never was. [00:39:17] For him to choose to endorse and support a person who started out just as a lesbian and became a radical lesbian feminist with all that that entails, who took on the APA around sexual abuse of patients with all that that entails, and so many other things, is really an incredible statement about who he was.\",\n",

       "  \"Du: Tell me about the projects you're working on now. Gianturco: I'll tell you about Wonder Girls. Well, what can I tell you about Wonder Girls? As far as I can tell, there are no other books that document the work of groups of activist girls. There are books about individual activists like Malala. But I was seeing, as early as 2007, girls in Zimbabwe who began a girls movement in their country. They made child rape a national issue using an interesting tool. [00:47:08] Remember, [the Girls' Empowerment Network] was started by a high school English teacher. Those girls use poetry, which they write about their own experiences and recite in public. As soon as they do, [snaps fingers] their communities are mobilized to action against the men who rape girls. I've been interested for a long time in what groups of girls can do, even groups of very young girls. I was particularly interested in the age group from ten to eighteen. The UN says you're no longer a girl after eighteen. You're a woman. So Wonder Girls. I was thinking about this book for a while, both in relationship to Women Who Light the Dark and Grandmother Power. It was a natural next step to explore the topic of groups of activist girls, partly because I think these intractable problems will take a long time to solve. [00:48:16] I was interested in groups because once there is [an organizational] structure, the current participants can go on to the rest of their 98 lives--and younger girls can grow into that structure and continue the work. So I wanted to focus on groups from the beginning. [For Wonder Girls], I went to thirteen countries, one of which was the US, and interviewed fifteen groups of activist girls working on all kinds of initiatives from the environment to social justice to exploitation to child marriage and so forth\",\n",

       "  \"intractable problems that face women virtually everywhere. [00:23:00] The first story was actually about a group started by a high school English teacher [Betty Makoni] in Zimbabwe who started an organization called the Girls Empowerment Network. Betty had been listening to the stories that her high school students-87 her English students--were telling her and she discovered that the medicine women in their culture were telling HIV-positive men that they would be cured if they had sex with virgins. The men were having sex with--they were raping--these teenage girls, who were, of course, then HIV-positive.

And the way he showed it was, and this was before the days when sexual harassment was a word, and he used to do it by telling the girls very, very dirty jokes. And of course, we were, like I said, both the girls in medical school, we had become desks and books, you know, we had no life experience much at all. And so all we could do was blush and had absolutely no idea what, if anything, we could or should do. We were speechless. And the other thing that he would do is he would find some area of weakness, and you know, we all have them, and he would find it and stick with it as a dog with a bone. And one day he started doing that on my lab partner who was another...was the other woman in the class, and found something she didn\\'t know. And rather than say, \"I don\\'t know, but I\\'ll know it next week, ask me again,\"\\x9d she ran off in tears, which is exactly what he wanted. And I looked up at him, and he was six-five, and I\\'m rather short. And I said \"I don\\'t think that was very professional; I don\\'t think that has any place in education.\"\\x9d I don\\'t know where it came from; I just blurted it out because I did not like the injustice of it. And he didn\\'t give me an oral exam that day. But, I walked into the finals...and all our exams were oral, and of course, you can\\'t fake those. And he was my examiner, and I thought, \"Oh, heavens, my goose is cooked.\"\\x9d And he did something that to this day I donÃ\\nÂ€Â™t know what he meant. I didn\\'t have the presence of mind to ask: he offered me a cigar. And of course, that\\'s not something that we did, women didn\\'t smoke, and certainly not cigars. And I don\\'t know if he meant you\\'re one of the boys, or what, but I said I didn\\'t know that, if he was trying to make a joke and put me at my ease, but that I...nothing was going to work except to have this examination behind me, so please, let\\'s begin. And he did...I have to say, he was very honorable, he 9 STANFORD UNIVERSITY/ALUMNI STORIES 2007/ELSE TRACY gave me a rather good grade.

It was easier for me because I wasn\\'t a wife, I wasn\\'t a mother, I didn\\'t have to multitask. All of the things that make it very, very, very difficult for the youth today, I get it because I spend time mentoring them. I understand the problem of multitasking and trying to be all things for all people. [00:25:29] It was easier for me because I didn\\'t have to do all those things. In a way, I could be very selfish. I didn\\'t have to take care of anybody else but myself and then do what I wanted to do. What I wanted to do was succeed at Stanford. I didn\\'t want to disappoint Henry Kaplan or Malcolm Bagshaw or Rich Hoppe or Dean Pizzo or whoever happened to be the person in leadership. So I never really saw gender as an issue. My friend Karen Fu, who was a trainee at the same time I was, reminded me of the day we came to Stanford. The room where the residents sat had lots of posters of Playboy pinups, posters of these braless calendar girls all over the walls. [00:26:26] I didn\\'t remember, but Karen told me we walked into the residents\\' room said, \"Take those down or we\\'re going to put male nudes up on the wall.\"\\x9d I said, \"Karen, did we say that?\" She said, \"Yes we did, and they took them down.\" [laughter] So there probably was an environment of what today we\\'d call harassment or not a very nice way to act, but I don\\'t remember it bothering me. [00:27:01] But my colleagues at Dartmouth, my friends, the girls in my class, talked about it all the time and still do, and they\\'re asked to speak about it and write book chapters on it and speak to women\\'s groups, etcetera. And they do. And I do, but I don\\'t remember it being negative. Maybe I just don\\'t put those things on my main menu. Maybe I just don\\'t let them bother me. If they bothered me, I didn\\'t put them in long-term memory. Gender has always been a card that\\'s worked very, very well for me.

Some of my colleagues spent more time thinking about issues like battered women or poor women or 74 women of color than I did because I've always been a theorist. And I'm sure that some of my colleagues did have it spill over more into their personal commitment and their political activism.

They're afraid that they're the only ones who are going to be punished for this. But if they report it and there are other similar reports supported by other people coming in, it means they are not alone in the world and they will be believed. It's an important step forward.\",\n",
       "  'Kraemer: [01:02:08] I think the one that I am most conscious of was the establishment of an office where sexual harassment was actually documented and the documentation was kept. The reason for this goes back to the time when I was working with David Hamburg at the outdoor primate facility. There were several research assistants there who were, they reported, molested by one of the psychiatry department members--not David, obviously. I won\\'t mention this person\\'s name, (he\\'s long gone by now). Anyway, it was a legitimate complaint. What 49 they were reporting was real molestation. This was not simply harassment or \"he says, she says\"\\x9d kinds of things -- unless they were lying, which it turned out they weren\\'t. Because there were so few women faculty members, the reported incidents landed on my desk. [01:03:18] I was assistant professor at the time, which meant that this shouldn\\'t have landed on my desk at all. I went to the chairman of the department once I ascertained that this was really a true report. These three girls were extremely upset and all they wanted to have happen was for the molestation to stop. They didn\\'t want the psychiatry department member punished, they didn\\'t want anything else. They wanted the molestation to stop. I reported to the chairman of the department, Tom Gonda, who fundamentally said, \"Boys will be boys.\"\\x9d [01:03:53] Those are actually his words. I then took the matter to Herant Katchadourian, then the ombudsman of the university. He took it to the dean, Miller at the time. I thought they handled it wonderfully well. They asked this faculty member to write an undated letter of resignation and sign it and told him that if this ever happened again, even one more incident of this type, they would simply accept his resignation at that point in time. Things cooled off for the next few years. [01:04:31] The problem was that when an incident of this sort happened again, some fifteen or twenty years later, there was no record of the earlier incident. The woman involved decided to sue Stanford. Tobey: Was this the same man? 50 Kraemer: [01:04:46] Same man. She was his research assistant. She decided to sue, and her lawyer made it clear that unless there had been some knowledge by the university that this was going on, Stanford could not be sued. She could sue him, but she couldn\\'t sue Stanford. The question then was: Had Stanford any knowledge of any untoward activities by this man? By this time, there was a different president of the university, a different provost, a different dean, a different chairman. Everything was different. [01:05:20] Nobody officially remembered the previous incidents at all. The lawyer went to Frances Conley and said. \"Do you know of anything?\"\\x9d Frances said, \"If anybody knows, it\\'s going to be Helen.\"\\x9d I had all the documentation and gave it to the lawyer. I thought that was only fair. But the letter of resignation was gone, so the wonderful solution all those years before had just disappeared. The suit was finally settled. The faculty member resigned and left the university, and he died a few years ago. The matter was settled. [01:06:01] Institutional memory is important in situations of this kind. They should have kept an eye on him all those years. The kind of behaviors that he was reported to have engaged in with these girls were not subtle, and in absence of oversight, he was going to repeat. Just ignoring such a situation was really bad.',\n",
       "  \"Kraemer: [01:06:43] There were actually two women faculty members involved. There were only three women faculty during this early period of time, and the one who supported and helped me during this time was Alberta Segal. The situation was bad for me, because you cannot put a nontenured person in that position when the person who's doing the harassing is a tenured professor. I lost funding. I got punished for doing this.\",\n",

Anyway, half of them were women and half were men. On one particular day, the men were not there, just happened, illness or whatever, and the women began talking about sexual abuse, their own, and that surely never would have come up if I had been a man. Swartz: They wouldn't have been as comfortable. Litt: [00:43:06] Exactly! I think that there were those opportunities that men would not have had in this context. And, some years later, I established and directed the House Staff Well-Being Committee, and again, being a woman was advantageous. And I mentored a lot of women residents and faculty because I think there is more of an affinity for a woman in those roles.\",\n",

       "  \"He tried to get women into the faculty. But those were important things, more important from the point of view of things that I did than harassment. Now, my very last days at Stanford involved me in a sexual harassment policy issue, or sexual harassment charge, which Fran Conley mentions in her book. It was alleged by somebody in radiology which was known as a place where there were issues. Tracy: An aggressive atmosphere? Mahoney: [sentences deleted] There was some complaint made to the dean of medicine, say, in the middle of the week. That same complaint in all its detail appeared in the San Jose Mercury in the Sunday edition on Saturday, arguing, complaining about the harassment of women in radiology. This man [the department chair who was the focus of the allegation] was asked about it the next Friday night when he went to temple, and his kid was asked about it at school. It was terrible. So the dean put together a committee. The committee did an investigation. I was part of the committee. Alberta was part of the committee. There was a group of us. We had a court reporter in the room at all times. We interviewed every tech in the hospital that worked with the department. We worked with everybody in the department. We had something like sixty-three interviews. 99 I came away from that process absolutely convinced that everybody in the department was harassed and that it was an equal opportunity harassment. It wasn't sexual. Women felt harassed especially when you combined their professional work with their family work, but men felt harassed. PhD men in the department felt harassed. It was a place of harassment. But we found no reason to think that this poor new chair of the department was the harasser. We did find reason to believe that there was somebody who didn't like his coming who might have been the source of this, but we didn't get into that, as our charge was merely to find what the story was. So that was my most exciting harassment story. I mean, sixty-three people and a court reporter whose salary just from us must have been in the six figures. They talked with medical terminology that I certainly didn't understand. She would stop them and ask them if they meant this or that. She had a bachelor's and a master's degree in some medical sciences field. But it was taken very seriously. So, no, I think sexual harassment claims have been seriously taken at Stanford.\",\n",
       "  'Mahoney: [01:41:45] Well, certainly a big one came up. By and large, the schools were good about taking care of them, and I don\\'t remember staff harassment issues, but by the time Amy Blue got over to business and finance, they 93 would have been paid attention to, but also I credit business and finance as paying attention to those issues, both before Bill Massy was business vice president, during, and after. So I don\\'t remember those coming up, but I do remember the school issues and I remember that the key people in helping schools deal with them were Leah Kaplan, the university\\'s ombudsperson, who was the wife, then widow of Henry Kaplan in radiology, and Alberta E. Siegel in the medical school, and also Eleanor Maccoby [Eleanor E Maccoby], who I think is still alive, living at Vi. So there was a network of people who paid attention in the schools, but sometimes you heard...I would hear from Alberta about stories that I took cognizance of but didn\\'t get involved in, a case of an infuriated human biology student who was going to have some kind of undergraduate research assistantship with somebody in the medical school, and he propositioned her in some fashion, which she rejected. And she was furious, and she went into that cafeteria in the Medical Center and, by happenstance, sat down next to a graduate student...I don\\'t think a medical student, I think in one of the disciplines of medicine, of the medical school, and spouted about having been propositioned. And the women she was venting on said, \"Oh, I know him. He did that to me too.\"\\x9d And this young woman said, \"We will take care of this. We will go see my freshman advisor.\"\\x9d And this graduate woman thought she was witless. Well, her freshman advisor was Don Kennedy. [Tracy laughs.] So they went over to Building 10, and the dean put together an investigation, and Alberta was involved in that investigation, which proved to be quite true, and 94 it needed in its outcome to go to the Advisory Board because any punitive reduction in pay or status...and I think this was a reduction in pay, temporary reduction in pay...has to go to the Advisory Board for vetting. Alberta said that people in the department, when she, at the dean\\'s behest, was doing this investigation, she said people said to her, \"This can\\'t be true. He has such a nice wife and some nice kids.\"\\x9d And Alberta said to me, \"That is not what this is about. We don\\'t need to make this part of the family, but we need to take care of it.\"\\x9d So my sense was that the issue was there, but the schools did a better job of it with the help of Kaplan and Siegel especially, and maybe others.',\n",

       "  \"Martin: [01:48:33] We had the female faculty caucus. As a result of first presenting the pay data, a lot of women called me to help them think through what they should do. I met a lot of women all over campus through that. Then I co-led the faculty caucus, and that brought other issues to the fore other than pay. Cecilia and I in particular took on Condi Rice (provost) on a number of those issues. We played the role of loyal to Stanford, but still in opposition on some issues. Then in the faculty senate, I was out there doing a lot of different things, not all to do with women. I got known. Then that got me elected. [01:49:32] I started getting elected to things like the Faculty Advisory Board. It just progressed. It wasn't solely, but it was heavily driven by getting to know women all over campus on the faculty. That was nice because I didn't know too many here in the Business School. We were so busy. [laughter] 64 There wasn't a lot of just social stuff. We did get together over dinner two or three times a year and it was mainly the Clayman Institute group. We'd get together for dinner and drinks and talk and stuff. We had a lot of one-on-one meetings. On an average week, I'd probably have lunch with other women two times, three times. [01:50:32] Sometimes a woman I didn't know needed advice on something, sometimes a woman who had been raped or harassed sexually, a faculty woman, and sometimes just a friend or a friend of a friend.\",\n",
       "  'Martin: [01:51:25] When I was the only woman faculty in the GSB--. If you were raped in the Business School -- student, faculty - -who would you come to on the faculty? So I did a lot of that kind of counseling then. The university ombudsman put complaints about certain faculty \"in the drawer.\"\\x9d There were complaints about some people over the years that were never acted on. The actual policy arguments were something I spoke up about in the faculty senate, but I wasn\\'t a primary person on that. Tracy: Considering your position and being one of the only women, what was your sense of how prevalent sexual assault and sexual harassment were? Did you see a change in that over the years? 65 Martin: [01:52:34] When I came I was really visible because I was the only one in the Business School. People came to me from all over campus, freshmen even, in tears, \"I was a virgin. I got raped.\"\\x9d Over time, the university began to respond on the undergraduate level by having a widespread network of people who did that kind of counseling. I was very glad to get out of that business. At the doctoral and postdoctoral and the faculty level, the retaliation and repercussions of complaining are really career-sensitive, particularly if you came to Stanford to work with one person in a very narrow field, and that person\\'s going to be writing your recommendations until the day he dies. Saying no to some of those people, they immediately would withdraw support from you. An offer to talk on a panel at a conference or contribute a chapter to a book suddenly disappears. It\\'s a hint that you better find someone else to write your letter of recommendation. Whether you\\'re going to actually take that complaint up through the university hierarchy when that person\\'s been doing this for years and has always gotten away with it, that\\'s a very tough decision for a victim, and I found it awkward. I don\\'t want to talk about this much more because every time someone comes to you, you\\'re supposed to report it to the administration. Some\\nof those cases, they would never have talked to me if they thought I would report it. They really needed to talk to somebody. I didn\\'t have pat answers because those people are damned if they do and damned if they don\\'t. We could talk more about what if this, and what if that, but like any good counselor, I wouldn\\'t tell someone what to do in a situation like that. I\\'ve been actively involved in that. By the time the policy 66 came through I spoke up, and I spoke up in the senate, and I think it had an effect on some issues. Over time, the most important aspects of that policy did get revised, sometimes better, sometimes worse. I was just one of many at that point.',\n",

The Business School faculty never sexually harassed me in any way. I didn\\'t have people jumping on me. That made it a lot easier. Aside from the most obvious sexual things, the amount of prejudice against the idea that a woman could be a first-class intellectual was intense. What broke my heart was when I got pregnant and started to show; the two faculty who I most admired came by to talk to me. One said, \"You will never be productive enough now. You were barely productive enough before. You\\'re never going to make tenure.\"\\x9d The other one said, \"I\\'m so happy for you. It\\'s so nice to see women with your intelligence and genes having babies. Of course, you\\'ll never get tenure.\"\\x9d Those were my two favorites. I had to say, am I going to cry, or am I angry?

We talked about the steamfitters putting the naked picture up in the steam plant. But this current issue in higher education of the women students and they're complaining about men, mostly undergraduates, right, what does 197 it mean to say no, and are the women students protected enough from the predatory male undergraduate, is a very tough problem. I think that it's a sign of another turn of the wheel in terms of the level of sophistication we'll finally get to about power and sex and these sex roles, and why was it this kind of a male who persists--so I find that hopeful, not because it will be a simple solution but to solve it, which I think will happen. I don't think it was solved even back then. We didn't even understand how bad it was, probably. I think that'll be a good thing in terms of women's power--I was involved in an undergraduate dorm for several years recently, and they did training, they did skits on what does it mean to say no. Devaney: You're talking about student behavior. Miner: [01:45:17] Sex--with each other, just with each other. They run seminars in dorms, and we have very serious efforts to solve these things. They have a skit and it's about if the woman says no, does she mean no, is that just a way to flirt. It's good because the women are learning from this whole issue. It's don't blame the victim, but on the other hand, shouldn't I have some role in taking care of myself. The men are learning. Some of these men are not coming from sophisticated environments, they really never have thought about the problem that a drunk woman saying nothing is not the same as yes. I think, actually, all that will replay and touch deeper on the link between gender and power in ways that will be healthy for everybody.\",\n",

       "  \"Miner: [00:11:32] I have a hard time answering that clearly. Sexism was so much part of the general culture, you kind of had to go out of your way to notice it, right? So were there sexists? Of course. I shouldn't even go into it, but there was one guy in one department who was just crazily sexist. I don't mean harassing. But in the culture of the time, they were trying not to be sexist, let me put it that way, and they meant for the women to succeed. It was a waste of money if they didn't, so they meant for it to work, and there were some very successful women students.\",\n",

Whatever my loving family did, they instilled in me a confidence that I rarely see in the young women I train now. 44 I have never been without confidence. I\\'ve never doubted what I could do. If you have that confidence, whatever is going on around you is their problem, not yours. I know that sounds odd, but it made a huge difference, having faith in myself.

I had a job to do, and it just never stopped me. [01:08:17] There were difficult experiences. Of course there were. I remember once giving a talk. I was quite young. It was just after I graduated. I gave a talk at a Gordon Research Conference. Gordon Conferences are meetings held up in New Hampshire and Vermont on specific areas of science. They go on for a week, and you meet in the morning and you meet at night. It\\'s scientists, all the hotshot scientists in your area. So it was a big honor that I was giving a twenty-minute talk at this thing, and I remember it was at night. It was in the days of miniskirts. This is late 1960s, early 1970s. It was rare to have women around, and there I was. I got up on the stage to start my talk, and my mic didn\\'t work. I said, \"Should I take it off?\"\\x9d [01:09:12] And some guy--I\\'ll never forget this--in the audience said, \"Take it off. Take it all off.\"\\x9d And there I am, standing there alone on this stage, at night, in a dark room, with the light on me, and all these men. I burst into tears. I had never done that before. The tears were just streaming down my face. Suddenly it got quiet in the room, and these guys had realized that they had crossed some terrible barrier. 45 I sniffed and wiped my tears away, and I said, \"Are you done, and are you ready to hear some science?\"\\x9d I took a deep breath, and I gave my goddamn talk. And that was the worst experience I had ever experienced. I figured if I could get through that, hey.',\n",
       "  \"Rodriguez: That's amazing. I want to talk a little bit more about you being a woman. I know this isn't the point you want to put emphasis on, but you brought it up a little bit today. Did you ever feel alienated by being a woman?\",\n",
       "  \"Strober: [00:09:02] We were able to get statistical data on other peer universities. We looked at universities in the Ivy League, and also at universities in the Pac-10 that we played football against, and we added MIT and Caltech to the mix. That was the group that we compared ourselves to. We were able to get those data in terms of percentage of women in the various ranks. But to try to get a handle on what women were thinking and feeling, we did interviews of Stanford faculty, and each of the committee members participated in conducting interviews with focus groups. We decided to concentrate on junior women, and we decided to interview men as well as women, because we wanted to know which problems were problems for all junior faculty and which were women's problems in particular. So we were able to sort that out pretty well. One of our major findings was that there was not a culture of support at Stanford, that departments went to great trouble to bring the best and the brightest junior faculty to Stanford and then proceeded to ignore them. There were faculty who told us they couldn't even get senior people in their department to read their work, and they didn't feel supported. This was men and women. Then a lot of women told us they felt underpaid. And there were problems with sexual harassment, particularly in the Medical School. We recommended that Stanford pay attention to this culture of nonsupport and try to create a new culture of support, and that the university look pretty carefully at the salary system to figure out what to do about these grave disparities in salaries between women and men.\",\n",
       "  'university actually tried to make those changes? Strober: [00:15:40] I think that the biggest change that was made was by Gerhard Casper, who was, after all, a law professor and very concerned about sexual harassment and the university\\'s obligations and liabilities. So he created a sexual harassment reporting system that I think was very good and continues to be very good. Particularly he created a group of people--and I was one of them--who were called sexual harassment advisors. I always used to joke that 49 if anybody wanted to sexually harass somebody, they had to come to me first for my advice. [laughter] But we were called advisors, and the good thing was that our names were publicized, and anybody from any place in the university could come and talk to any of the advisors. So if you were a woman in Chemistry and you didn\\'t want to talk to an advisor in the sciences because you wanted more anonymity than that, you could come and talk to me, and many women from the sciences did come and talk to me. Gerhard was very concerned about due process for the person who was being accused, and he was also concerned about the rights of the person who was doing the accusing, and I think he set up a system that was fair. It\\'s not perfect. Many women suffer sexual harassment and don\\'t report it because they fear for their future, particularly graduate students, where it might get around in their discipline that they have complained in this way, and they\\'re fearful that they won\\'t get an assistant professor position. So it isn\\'t perfect. But the other thing Casper did was to hire Laraine Zappert to run this program, and she is a therapist and very sensitive to all these issues of rights and responsibilities. She trained all the advisors, and she often worked behind the scenes, so if someone, for instance, would come to me with a complaint, I would go to her. Let me backtrack a minute. As an advisor, I had to be very careful to tell the person who was coming to talk to me that if she told me the name of the person who was being accused, that it was my responsibility to report that to Laraine. But the woman didn\\'t have to tell me the name of the 50 person. She could come to me and tell her story and get advice without telling me the name, in which case I would tell Laraine that a complaint had been made. But I wouldn\\'t tell her by whom, and I wouldn\\'t tell her, obviously, who was being accused because I didn\\'t know myself. But if the woman complaining told me who she was accusing, even if she didn\\'t want to file a complaint, Laraine might talk to her and kind of work behind the scenes. So, for example, one time there was a complaint, and Laraine suggested tha\\n I go to the faculty member who was being accused, with that faculty member\\'s department chair, and just sort of tell that person that there had been somebody who had talked to me and maybe this faculty member wanted to be a little more circumspect in the future. And you would be surprised, this works well. Faculty members, when they are confronted by their peers who tell them, \"This is not acceptable behavior at this university,\"\\x9d may well reform. Luu: That\\'s good to hear. Strober: [00:20:28] Yes. So I think, as I say,',\n",
       "  'Strober: [00:23:40] Well, I thought the trainings were excellent when I started out. After all, I don\\'t have a background in counseling of any sort. And I thought the sessions that Laraine organized were very helpful in terms of understanding what Stanford\\'s policy was, understanding what the law was, 52 and understanding how to listen to people who are in great pain. The same thing with the women who came to me with their terribly sad stories about tenure and promotion. At least I could provide a sympathetic ear and a warm heart, and that was helpful to them, and I think that was true for the harassment situations too. Sometimes the women didn\\'t understand what exactly was happening to them because there was very little quid pro quo sexual harassment, where a faculty member would say, \"If you don\\'t sleep with me, I\\'m going to give you a failing grade.\"\\x9d It was more what we called hostile environment harassment, and particularly in the sciences where there were very few women and the environment was very male and very hostile, situations arose like going to strip clubs at meetings off campus. So one of the things I did was to provide a sounding board for these women to say, \"Yes, what I\\'m experiencing is in fact harassment, and, no, I don\\'t have to put up with this.\"\\x9d What I would tell them is that whether they wanted to file a formal complaint or not, perhaps they just wanted to absent themselves from difficult situations. I assured them that it was not part of their job description, formal or informal, to go to strip clubs. And also I spent time teaching women to say no, because the first part of the training really was that if somebody is being sexually harassed, they need to make it very clear to the harasser that they want this to stop, and some of the women had not done that, and so I counseled them to do that and then see what happened. Sometimes a couple of words did the trick, and sometimes it didn\\'t.',\n",

And yet, at the same time, there was concern for each of them about well, are the county commissioners going to say \"Oh, we\\'ll just fund you all in one fell swoop and then you can fight among yourselves about it.\" Or at times we were trying not to get into these power trips of \"Oh, this is the most important person, agency. I want my agency to do that.\" We spent a lot of time talking about that. We\\'d be sitting on the floor in this little place that had been rented by the Coalition for Battered Women, and trying to make sure that the agencies felt respected by the other agencies and that the funding would also go to all three, to each of them. I think we were left almost without a choice because the county commissioner said, \"Well, here it is.\" They wanted to appoint this one person who would decide all of these financial decisions. That united the three of the agencies, saying \"Well, actually, I think that we need to remain separate.\" The majority of the county Elaine Barney 17 commissioners were men, and sometimes they couldn\\'t grasp the fact that a Rape Crisis Center would be very different from a Women\\'s Health Counseling Service, which would be very different from the Coalition for Battered Women. It was like, \"But you\\'re all women and you\\'re all talking about it, so why not just put it all together?\" and it\\'s like, \"Doesn\\'t work that way.\" Because everyone each had a piece of it, we knew what we wanted in each of the agencies. How to ensure that the general public understood that was going to take some doing. That\\'s where we spent a lot of time. And understanding that yeah, Women\\'s Health Counseling Service doesn\\'t have the same financial needs that perhaps the Rape Crisis Center, or the Coalition for Battered Women, would have. But it also had certain needs that weren\\'t being met, but we needed the money for them. For example, this woman Faye I think was',\n",

Can you remember how this started happening, that everybody kind of got together and how this idea of \"We need a women\\'s center\" comes into the picture?',\n",

It\\'s a whole system. I think these HOPE Circles did the same thing for women, where they would get together and they would say, \"Yeah, I\\'ve had this problem with the banks too. They\\'ve treated me this way.\" So what can we do with banks to help, because banks discriminate against low income women, right? So there was that, and then there was the sharing of the personal stories. A lot of women have stories, sad stories of abuse, rape, violence. Many, many women have been battered and they would share those and we would hear about that. I know there was one leader training that I was [at] with Marci Campbell and meMarci was the PI of the projectsand we were all crying because women were talking about these stories. But for them, then they would say, \"It\\'s so wonderful to have a place to go and be able to say whatever you want to say and not be judged for it.\" There was a vow of confidentiality in the circles, and that was one of the major ground rules, is nothing goes out of the circle.

Actually, almost all the women I knew either were, or had been, flight attendants. And in fact, I have two friends now who I\\'ve known since we were flight attendants together, who I\\'m still friends with. They both live on the west coast, they both live in the Seattle area. It\\'s funny. And one of them who had been my roommate, her daughters are my godchildren. So we still have that connection. So all the women either were, or had been, flight attendants, who were in this consciousness-raising group. And some of that was also from the union, because some of the women in the union, some of the women I flew with who were in the union, and who were active in the union were more political. And truthfully, it was San Francisco, and so probably as a group we were more feisty and political than some of the other places. So anyway, yeah, we had a consciousness-raising group there. And then when I came back here, I started one here. I think those were really big. I think those were really--. It\\'s hard. This probably sounds inflated and pompous to say that they we were really revolutionary, but in a way they really were. Because it was the only time, for all of us, it was the only time we ever really got to talk about those, or had a chance to even explore with each other, \"Gee, have you ever been to the doctor and they did this to you?\" Or talking about people who had been sexually abused, or raped--. I mean, that was never, ever talked about. So it truly was a liberating experience for people to be able to talk about that with each other, and find out that we had so many things in common, as far as those experiences as women. And the sad part of it was that often it didn\\'t go anywhere. You just shared all that, and then you felt personally empowered, but it didn\\'t necessarily lead to any action, which is always the case with us, with \"lefties,\" right? We talk a lot, but we don\\'t always take action. But it was incredible. It was an incredible part of the foundation of women\\'s awakening, if you will. And I think that some of the women\\'s work that I did in the [19]80s and \\'90s was that way, too. It was kind of, women opening up to each other and being able to say things they couldn\\'t say anywhere else. It was pretty important stuff.',\n",

I'm sure there are horror stories about that time from other people. But for me, it was a time of being totally able to go to a limit that I never dreamed existed, and to understand myself in relation to some things that I never thought about before. And I always have been a little philosophical. I managed to always have been one of those--. And even quasi-religious at some point, and so, the whole spiritual and soul-searching aspects and behavioral aspects of doing drugs and the whole culture thing was fascinating to me, and wonderful.

Even though I thought I knew a lot about women's experience, it was a whole other piece of my political education. And then, also understanding the role of how those things work in small towns, like a beauty shop, how that works as far as what it does for the community in terms of bringing people together, and how it's a place where, it's like a consciousness-raising group. And how much support, and how much that was where women were able to be free. I don't know, I could have written a whole book about that experience. It was a wonderful experience.

They knew I needed a TV and radio so they were like, \"Sure!\" 16 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So anyways she came to the rec to tell us what happened and that was my first introduction to rape or sexual assault or knowing anybody who openly said that they were sexually assaulted. And she told us what happened, but she didn\\'t want to do anything. She didn\\'t want to tell anybody. She just needed to tell somebody because she walked into the dorm crying, distraught, what have you. So I said, \"Oh we can do something.\" She said \"Well, I don\\'t want to do anything.\" And so I was trying to ...\\x81gure out what we could do without saying who it was and it was football players. And so I thought we could take on the football players and I did. Needless to say, nothing changed for them. However they will remember that that\\'s when it sparked for me that, \"Oh, there\\'s agencies that do something about this so we should at least have information available for people, for young women,\" and so rape crisis stuff became available in our dorms because I just didn\\'t know what else to do at that point. So that\\'s what I did I ...\\x81gured out who would know what to do. So that is how I chose my senior topic and I interviewed the Rape Crisis Center of Cumberland County and decided, \"Oh this is pretty interesting. Like people can do this for a living and I don\\'t have to be a p\\nychiatrist to actually help people?\" And so I did the paper and, a joint paper actually. I did it on African Americans who were sexually assaulted because then I became intrigued by incest and child sexual abuse and how it became very much a family thing. And of course I really only did African Americans because I was one and wanted to be able to ask my family who clearly was not interested in disclosing all these things. But I really had more of a conversation with my grandmother and my great aunt because I wanted a perspective from them, given everything was swept under the rug then. 17 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So I wrote the paper and I knew I was going to graduate in December and by that time I had already met who now is my husband. We had started dating that last year that I was at school and I didn\\'t know when I wanted to get my Masters then because I knew I wasn\\'t going to take any biology or botany [KL and PV laugh, 25:00]. So I didn\\'t really know what a career choice was. I just knew that I wanted to do something to help people. And the thing that I always will say about Thomasville High School and the Thomasville School Systems, which they knew very little I would say, but they knew how to score aptitude tests and it was right. In the seventh grade a teacher told me, \"You will do something to help people. That\\'s innately who you are and it\\'s what matters to you and it\\'s what is important.\" She said \"You scored very well in all of these other things, but everything came back to people.\" And that\\'s true; it\\'s in my DNA somehow. And so my husband, who is not my husband got a job in a small town in Scotland county as a math teacher and he called me because he graduated before I did and he was like, \"There\\'s a job at a rape crisis center and it is just now opening,\" and I was like, \"Oh, why not?\" So I went to interview with two people and I stood up to walk out and they were like \"So when can you start work?\" I was twenty, I wasn\\'t even twenty-one yet and I was like, I\\'m pretty sure there are some question I should be asking, but since I didn\\'t know what they were. I said, \"I will call you back.\" So at any rate, so we had a conversation and they officially offered me the job.',\n",
       "  'MJH: So I have men on staffhere so I think they are integral to this work. My husband and I went on a vacation with some friends and one of the things he said which I think speaks to my thought on men in the movement, which I might add happened in 1998 right before we got married so I didn\\'t realize that this would be about how I thought men were in the movement. But again I think it matters. I think everyone has a role in this work. I don\\'t think, just like any other major, you know, political or human rights or social justice issue, it can\\'t be stopped by the people who were persecuted. So there has always had to be allies in those that have 29 Monika Iohnson-Hostler privilege and power and that I also believe that those--which are in feminist principles--that you know, that the majority, whether it is men or whether it\\'s based on race or sexual orientation or ability, there is always a privileged side of the coin. And so if those people with privilege and power aren\\'t engaged in the work then we can keep doing the work but we\\'re pushing up against in most cases the people who are perpetrating whatever it is and in my case it\\'s sexual Violence. So the majority of perpetrators are men. We clearly have women who perpetrate, but the majority are men. And so I believe that other men have to hold men accountable because there are more good men then there are men who rape and so if the majority of those men do their work and are allies and really setting the standard--. My husband\\'s a teacher. He teaches math. His job is to still integrate what I do, that it\\'s important that you respect women even before our daughter. And he does that. I tell people every day, \"If my husband could figure out how to integrate sexual Violence prevention in math [KL and PV laugh], you can figure out how to integrate it anywhere. So I guess what I would say is I\\'ve always known the importance of men in the work. But I do have some feelings about it that I think we\\'re going to have to work out in this work. That men have come into this work and I\\'ve said to men that come into the work, they come in and they charge their worth because again that\\'s a privilege that men have. Men tend to say, \"we\\'ll charge $10,000 just to tell you why men should be allies.\" People ask me to come speak all the time, I\\'m like, \"Oh it\\'s free.\" NCCASA doesn\\'t have travel so you may have to pay for my plane ticket, but like those things don\\'t matter because most of the women who do this work do it because it matters and because it is important to them and I 30 Monika Iohnson-Hostler think men that come to this work believe that. But men are also socialized very differently than women and so they ask for their worth. And I don\\'t think that\\'s wrong, but I do think it matters in the work because now we\\'re able to see yet again a disparity being played out in a work where we\\'re trying to move to equality for men and women. KL: Right. MJH: Because the anti-rape movement that\\'s about ending rape but it\\'s also about social justice and equality and liVing in a culture where women and girls are not hyper-sexualized so that they do have, they are coming to the table with some forms of privilege and power that are not associated with being male or of a certain race or a certain dominant group and all of those things I think are interwoven into our work. If I do this work from a place of know that the most vulnerable people to being sexually violated are on the other side ofthe non-privileged side of the coin. So people of color, people that have disabilities, people who you know are female. People who are children, people who don\\'t live, their sexual preference is not heterosexual which is dominant in this culture. Like all of those people are closer to the margin of vulnerability in sexual Violence and we know this based off of prevalence numbers. The amnesty report among Native Americans I think has been eye opening to this country for people who have been listening even a little bit. To see that all of those things matter how we treat people in this country. KL: Right [laughs]. 31 Monika Iohnson-Hostler MJH: Again there\\'s probably not a thing that you can\\'t come up with that I cannot integrate this in. So that\\'s my framework. Right or wrong that\\'s how I live. That\\'s Monika\\'s philosophy.',\n",
       "  'So at NC CASA we\\'re a statewide organization that is a membership organization for the ninety plus rape crisis centers in North Carolina. So every county is served by a rape crisis center but there are about sixty-three court agencies that have offices in about ninety-two counties. But then they have staff covering the other eight counties that there are not a physical of...\\x81ce for sexual assault. So they provide direct services which is what I did in Scotland County for many years. But we do the training for those advocates. We also do law \\nnforcement training on sexual assault specifically so impact of sexual Violence, prevalence and how to interview sexual assault survivors. We also train sexual assault nurse examiners forensic nurses on evidence collection and the importance of the survivor because what they do is scientific and what we do is let them know that that is a human being that is the evidence. And so we provide training there. We also provide training for anybody who needs it. We have a campus consortium which now we have probably over forty campuses who are a part of our campus consortium so they have their own advisory committee of campuses and we provide prevention training to them and with them because a lot of them now have federal grants that they have at their school universities to do sexual Violence or domestic Violence preventions; but we do the sexual assault side ofthings. And we also work with all of the state agencies on writing model policies. So we just wrote a policy on new research because I wrote one in 99. There wasn\\'t a lot of research but now there\\'s lots of research. And we also have an administration, our presidential administration who has this as a priority issue. So of course it helps to have the Vice 24 Monika Iohnson-Hostler president that has a, \"One is too many,\" website on sexual assault that happens on college campuses. So that\\'s a huge initiative for us, which we want to work on with the department of public health. You all interviewed the council for women so you all know they\\'re a funder and we are, statutorily the coalition provides training to the agencies that they fund which are the rape crisis centers. So they fund direct services and we train direct service providers. So there is a lot ofturnover because now that I\\'m older I know that they really don\\'t make a lot of money to do work that is stressful and that absolutely has a high turnover and burnout rate. I just did my ...\\x81rst career fair at my daughter\\'s elementary school and I realized this is not a career that anyone will ever tell you that you can ever have. So I\\'m looking in her yearbook and it actually has where I work, but they asked me to come talk about being a non-pro...\\x81t director and I said, \"Well that is really great of them to put where I work,\" because now somebody knows that is a career. Because even in college this isn\\'t a career choice you\\'d think that you would do. Even women\\'s studies majors, a lot of them think about policy which is now where I now spend the bulk of my time. So that\\'s what we do our work revolves around training and education for direct service providers whether they are rape crisis centers or we call them allied professionals or first responders who would be involved in a sexual assault case, and then campuses. But we also do prevention work, which is also training people how to do prevention so society systematically understands that it is our job to change to prevent children from being sexually abused, not children and not just singularly parents but systems are also a part of that. So we do systems work as 25 Monika Iohnson-Hostler well which is mostly translated into policy. So we do both state and federal policy and so, which there will be a trend here. So in that I\\'m also the chair of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, which I have been for, my daughter\\'s six so almost six years. I know that\\'s a long time to be a chair [all laugh]. But it is a policy making body so all of our work and there\\'s no staff so we\\'re all volunteer so I tell people my 6-10 job which is when I leave here is to work with federal policy. That is in both writing and advocating for it, and that advocacy isn\\'t just to Congress on the importance of passing legislation but it\\'s also to agencies so that they understand why it\\'s important that the policy governs their work. So that\\'s my current focus, as a public policy in legislation.',\n",
       "  'So we have a lot of meetings because there\\'s probably not a state entity that isn\\'t impacted by our work. So that\\'s health, that\\'s human services, that\\'s schools, that\\'s universities, you know, it\\'s department of administration. It\\'s every agency or cabinet level agency that should be concerned about these issues. So we\\'ve done a good job because there is a state sexual assault coalition in all fifty states and territories including Washington D.C. So I\\'m a counterpart in all those states and territories which [cheer in the background from bridal shower, MJH laughs] make up the alliance the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. And so a lot of those meetings are for really helping them understand 26 Monika Iohnson-Hostler where sexual Violence is integrated. So we\\'re in the room so we at least understand that they should be there, but they don\\'t necessarily always understand why I say, \"I\\'m Monika Johnson-Hostler from the North Carolina Coalition to End Sexual Assault\". Everybody in the room doesn\\'t necessarily understand why we are there, so my job is to say why we are there. So if it\\'s funding priorities you know I\\'m there to say to them, \"You know sexual assault does this, this is what prevalence looks like in the school system. This is what prevalence looks like in you know adult facilities or nursing homes or group homes.\" So I always tell people there\\'s probably not a facet of life that I can\\'t probably tell you how it\\'s connected because sexual assault happens across the lifespan and there are no boundaries. And so there\\'s almost not somewhere we can\\'t integrate sexual Violence. And it should be because again to get to, I really do come to work so that there is not a work for me to come to and that can\\'t happen without convincing the rest of the world that it matters, and that we are the only ones that can keep women and children primarily safe. Because you know we have a society that allows perpetrators to continue to perpetrate; if we didn\\'t we wouldn\\'t still be dealing with it so. So that\\'s what I\\'m doing at those meetings, telling them why it matters [KL and PV laugh] and how it fits into whatever they\\'re talking about.',\n",

       "  'I was not as active on the local level, but I joined NOW and all those good old great ones and became a real advocate for not just social workers, but women in those positions, women in the field. So that\\'s been my focus all these years. I\\'m a very verbal person, and so I made lots of speeches when I was with-the next program that I worked in in Child and Family was the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. So that included, as I shared with you on the phone, I think, that agency had sort of a research project that started with setting up a helpline in 1979. The helpline was for women and children to call in and report just to the helpline or just to talk about their abuse, primarily sexual abuse was the target. And that meant any women that had been sexually abused as a child or were still or had been raped or a child that had been molested or somehow been offended sexually. So that sort of experiment or, in research terms, sort of out there to gather data, that following next year, the referrals to the Department of Human Services went up four hundred percent. So that data was used to support getting the funding for a regional research and service delivery system for abuse victims and so that\\'s where the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. It\\'s an unwieldy name, but PASAAC, and I was clinical supervisor there for six years. So I did a lot of speaking at that time throughout the southeast. And what we did was try to get the various parts of the systems that deal with abuse to talk to each other. Police-if a rape was reported, how do they talk to the victim? What kind of services were available at the emergency center, the emergency rooms? Of course, the Department of Human Services that gave services to children, often they weren\\'t communicating with anybody. The sheriff\\'s department, the police, all of those people needed to coordinate services and learn how to not do further damage because the interrogation, particularly around rape, man, it was almost as bad as the rape sometimes for women. So we advocated strongly for that to change and for a more humane, more private inquiry, and did a lot of training throughout the southeast all the way from Texas to South Carolina, Florida. JW: Was there openness to that kind of change or what was that process like? RJ: What was that process? (laughs) Well, the big resistance, you can imagine, was from [males].We wanted to include doctors and many physicians would not, were the most resistant group. And I\\'m not sure why that was. I think a lot of that was because there weren\\'t very many women physicians at that point. And I think that, number one, a lot of men had not been trained to really see rape as [a crime]. They saw it as, well, did she have any injuries, was she pregnant, and that\\'s it, and not any of the psychological impact of being assaulted that way. JW: Were you trying to get them to report cases? RJ: Yes, definitely trying to get, well, trying to help them help the victim, to take charge, and to talk about it. A lot of women still won\\'t talk about being raped because back then, of course, there was very anti-female [attitude]. First of all, rape didn\\'t exist. Number two, if you were raped, you asked for it, you wanted it, because you wore that skirt too short or you were being seductive or you didn\\'t say \"no\" loud enough. Why did you finally give in? Nobody can [be raped]. It was a lot of old boy things: \"Well, nobody gets raped. If you don\\'t want to have sex then you just say no.\" But the fact that the man was two hundred and fifty pounds and the woman was a hundred had nothing to do with it. So there was a lot of denial of inequities, physical strength and intimidation, and then the women often felt so guilty and so dirty. All she wanted to do was forget it, and so there was not much follow-up for the mental health [treatment]. So as the next project that I worked on, as clinic supervisor at the Sexual Assault Center, which was an agency designed specifically to work with women and children. [The] women that had been sexually assaulted or had been sexually abused as children and were still dealing with the trauma. So I ran a group for nine years for women that had been sexually assaulted or had reoccurring memories. The whole memory thing got really to be an issue. And then, of course, I had staff that worked with children that had been abused, a lot of play therapy and those kinds of things. JW: And what year did you start that? RJ: Oh gosh. I left Child and Family in \\'86-no, I started in private practice in \\'86. I left Child and Family in \\'84. I went with Overlook Mental Health Center for a couple years and then I went in private practice. And when I went in private practice in \\'86, then that\\'s when I associated also with the Sexual Assault Center. There was three of us on staff, four on staff at the time and so I was the clinical supervisor and then we started adding staff. I was there for fifteen years on some level. JW: So how were you learning to counsel people through this when, like you said, rape didn\\'t exist? You were part of that movement to say, \"Wait a second. It does.\" RJ: It does exist and it has more than physical impact on the victim. Well, how were we learning that? Well, learning how to be a counselor, quote, therapist. Counseling usually is around solving problems, defining problems and solving problems in a real sort of one, two, three way. That\\'s my definition. Now therapy is a much longer and more in-depth look at how you reacted to the problem on an emotional level and what that did to your mental health. What has it done? Do you find yourself depressed, staying in bed all day long, or continuing to get into self-destructive, abusive relationships? That takes a long time to figure out how to break those patterns and we\\'re now learning a whole lot more about the brain. If I had time to go, I\\'d be a neurologist. I would study that and how to educate people to train their brain differently. We know that can happen now. We have the technology, and we have the expertise. But anyway, back to how do you learn how to deal with somebody about a behavior or an event that supposedly doesn\\'t happen. (laughs) Well, the first thing you do is say, \"It does happen.\" And again, since we\\'re products of our culture, you have to do a lot of work on yourself, or at least I did, in saying, \"Yeah, that happens and yes, it\\'s not good and yes, most of the victims are women, but also little boys get raped and vulnerable males also get raped.\" So you have to sort of retrain your own thinking about that and disconnect yourself from the common belief system. It has some service in the community to deny certain things and so you have to figure out, okay, if I rock the boat, what happens? What role do I play? It\\'s like the whole thing with women, the women\\'s movement. There was this thought that women, you can have it all. You can\\'t have it all. You have to make choices. You can\\'t be the CEO of a multimillion-dollar corporation and be there every time your kid has a fever. You can\\'t do it. So you make choices.',\n",
       "  'RJ: Well, how has it been slow to change? JW: Or has it been? Has this mostly been a positive story of success? RJ: Well, in some ways for some people it has. I think there\\'s still a lot of, and I\\'m thinking of just a great influence on people\\'s attitudes on sex generally and then, concomitant of that, the misuse of sex to control somebody, which is essentially [abuse]. Rape is not about sex. It\\'s about violence and control, because if you want to have good sex, you don\\'t rape. And sexual overtures to a child essentially, those people, in my humble opinion, do not have power any place else or they don\\'t feel powerful in any place else. So it\\'s not about the use of your sexual self for pleasure or for connection. It\\'s about violence, psychological violence if not physical violence, on another person. So how have we changed? I\\'m not so sure that television and popular media doesn\\'t sometimes glorify non-consensual sex and it certainly, I don\\'t think, creates enough distaste for prostitution and those areas that females get entrapped maybe. I know that some of your audience would probably say, \"Well, there\\'s choice there too.\" Anyway, so we\\'ve both been changing toward appreciation for the individual and individual choice and for women, but we\\'ve also degraded, to some degree, the whole process of sexuality and made it entertainment and/or a power play. It\\'s kind of sad in a lot of ways. I\\'m at the age where I don\\'t want to sound like a curmudgeon and blah blah blah blah, the world\\'s going to the dogs, but I have spent my whole career, adult life, advocating for women and for choice and for equality in all arenas. I don\\'t think we\\'ve got there yet. What is real discouraging at times is to see women who get power and also become abusive and not nice, not helpful, not nurturing. We know of those folks. That\\'s really sad. So maybe it\\'s the power in the human family that\\'s the culprit, not necessarily discrimination based on male-female, but it\\'s on the power group versus the un-empowered. It\\'s possible for us to destroy ourselves as a species. So have we made progress? I don\\'t know, but the human community is very slow. Again, I think our brain is slow to change. And once we get an idea, it\\'s very hard to change back and say, \"Hmm, maybe, maybe the best place for children is not eight to ten hours a day in daycare.\"',\n",
       "  \"JW: And in those years, were you getting more engaged in the women's liberation movement?\",\n",
       "  'JW: In what ways has the culture been slow to change around these issues of sexual assault and rape and the violence?',\n",
       "  'SK: No, not a whole lot, because what we fought for on campus\". You know we fought for a bunch of things on campus and we did get a women\\'s center in the university center, the women\\'s studies program, women\\'s athletics, you know, we were doing all those kinds of things on campus at that time. In the 1980s we were fighting for things like sexual harassment policy.',\n",
       "  'SK: That\\'s been really tough. There were a couple things that we had to work on in a variety of ways. One of them was language, okay, so that one\". Let\\'s see. We did that through the Commission for Women, so the Commission for Women in that case, we proposed some language guidelines and we got Chancellor Reese to agree to append them to the faculty handbook, because we wanted to have some place that we could point to and say you need to use gender neutral language. I\\'m coming to sexual harassment, but actually what you might think would be harder, we got that first that way. On the sexual harassment thing, I was on a committee of the AEP [Affirmative Employment Program] and we looked at policies at various schools and drafted one, and that\\'s probably dated in the 1980s, and again that\\'s all we\\'ve got and that\\'s become an issue. Okay, so at least we got something done, and it was that we were not successful, let\\'s say, in getting the administration to put one in but we could come in the back way and say we\\'re proposing this, so it\\'s coming from the side, if you will. Then you\\'d encounter all these people saying things like, \"But that\\'s how I met my wife. That\\'s how I met my husband. You\\'re denying us the opportunity.\" [Laughs] Well just keep your pants zipped up and wait a little while. It\\'ll work. JF: [Laughs] SK: But you can\\'t say those things. So Cheryl Travis and I have been talking about updating that policy because she\\'s been working on some stuff in the psychology department and I\\'ve been trying to get the AEP to retake it up as an issue, to update it and make it more powerful, because what it is, is it\\'s very weak. It\\'s a weak statement as it\\'s written because that\\'s what we could get accepted, but ultimately you have to be strategically political. It\\'s better to have something that you can build on than have nothing. It doesn\\'t have enough clout in it, if you will. So, yeah, that\\'s one of our current projects, is to try and do that, and Cheryl [Travis] and I have published together on sexual harassment. It\\'s been a topic of interest. Certainly in the field of psychology it\\'s rampant. [Laughs] I mean in that professors exploiting graduate women has been talked about for decades and continues. JF: What was the resistance to a stronger sexual harassment policy? SK: Well it always starts from the kind of thing of sort of denying people the right to meet other people, as I said: That\\'s how I met my husband; that\\'s how I met my wife. That I think underneath it all is the idea of, you know, sort of like with rape, that there\\'d be false accusation, that there\\'d be misunderstandings. But overall institutions are not keen on dealing with sexual harassment, so I spent eight or nine years as the ombudsperson for students on campus and obviously encountered students who had various problems, and I discovered that the institution basically wants them to go away, okay. So they don\\'t want there to be action taken against somebody for sexual harassment; they want them to leave, or the student to leave, or whatever, okay, because that\\'s the whole problem with a lot of the policies that you have to sort of protect people, is that the institution\\'s really at heart trying to protect itself and so they\\'re not going to be supportive of things that would ever sort of make it public or lead to lawsuits or whatever. So, yeah, that\\'s why there\\'s not stronger policies. JF',\n",

       "  'LL: I don\\'t think I\". If there was an instance of that I can\\'t remember it. I did have to deal on two occasions with male faculty members who had been accused, both of whom came very close to crying in my office, asking me to stop this investigation, this is not true, blah, blah, blah, but the university was really under a very serious mandate. If you accept federal money then this is how you\\'re going to deal with these kinds of gender or racial or whatever situations, and all I could do was say I\\'m not in a position to be your judge in this matter. I am in a position to tell you that you have created a situation that is intolerable for your colleagues. Both of these guys in effect were denied tenure, they were both in science departments, and there were things they did that I probably could have told them they shouldn\\'t do, but I didn\\'t feel I could really get involved. There is a member of the central administration whose business it is to look into these kinds of issues and I wasn\\'t going to go there but I was not going to cover anything up either, so it was sad. One of the guys\"I\\'ll tell you this now\"one of the things he did, which I\\'m sure he didn\\'t realize at all, but one of my areas of research was nonverbal communication for awhile, but this guy moved into your space, just to carry on an everyday conversation. This would have been uncomfortable for him. He would have had to pull his chair right over to the corner. I spoke with him at a number of public occasions, receptions or something, and in every instance I was aware that what I wanted to do was step back. He was too close. JF: Did he do this to men and women? LL: I don\\'t know. The men never complained; I\\'ll put it that way. The other guy was in one of the sciences and took groups of students every summer to do research in the Everglades. I don\\'t know what they were doing but they lived in these kind of, I don\\'t know what, quasi-dormitories that would house\". There would be a big meeting room and then sort of a sleeping gallery on either side. The facility was owned by the University of Georgia and we were just able to rent it sometimes. But he would walk around in his underpants. It was not air conditioned, they were there in the summertime in the middle of a swamp, and I guess I could understand that, but it really made the women uncomfortable, but I didn\\'t say it. I just said some things are happening at that camp which have got to stop, and he didn\\'t know what I was talking about and I said you\\'ll have to deal with committee; they\\'ve got the report. But what I had to do in order to satisfy the tenure committee was to see to it that he was not in any kind of situation for the year he had when he knew that he was not going to be tenured. No women graduate students were assigned to him and no small seminar groups. All he could do was teach big lecture sections. They were uncomfortable situations. Both of them said they didn\\'t know what they were doing but in hindsight they had some inkling. Both of them happened to be married. I think one had no children, the other had one son. This is awful: They were both married to really unattractive women. They were women in the same discipline, and this was before the day when you hired somebody, the trailing spouse is coming through, you\\'ve got to find a tenured position for her too. But I thought if you\\'re both in the same discipline and you\\'re both alike politically, philosophically, what do you talk about at night and what are your lives like? I realize now I was just looking for ways of rationalizing their behavior, but you really couldn\\'t. They knew what they were doing. Both of them, I\\'ll have to admit, got jobs at good universities elsewhere, but nobody at those hiring universities ever called to ask me why the person was leaving either, so we just didn\\'t go there.',\n",
       "  'Absolutely. I learned from a friend after my deanship that all the women administrators at the university were called \"suits\" because we all wore suits, period, and the men would come in in slacks and shirtsleeves but the women administrators did not. You reminded me also that last summer I had varicose veins repaired and when the physician first came in to look at the sonographs, or whatever they were looking at, he said, \"I\\'ll bet you were a teacher,\" and I said, \"Yeah, this is forty years of standing on your feet in high heeled shoes,\" and he said, \"It\\'s a story I hear [1:12:19 every day.]\" Now, of course, I mean Suzanne doesn\\'t wear high heels to class, but you just did. In the classes you went into, you were put together. I don\\'t think I ever wore slacks to class until, I don\\'t know, probably the \\'80s, sometime in there. You wore dresses, you wore stockings and high heeled shoes, and what a fool we were to do those kinds of things. [Laughs] JF: But I think there\\'s\". It\\'s a shame it has to be that way but\" LL: No, you know\" JF: \"there is something to it. LL: \"I shouldn\\'t have said that because I really don\\'t believe that. Having a granddaughter, I\\'m mightily distressed now with women on television. You look at male newscasters, they\\'re all up there with suits and ties and looking all put together and you see women newscasters and they\\'re in all kinds of revealing clothes, skirts up to here, and I don\\'t get it. I don\\'t know what this means or how one is supposed to think of these women. There was a situation on the news not too long ago; I think it was in Boston, up east someplace. A woman was raped and somehow managed to survive. It was intended to be a homicide. One of the newscasters, like an idiot, asked the sheriff, how can women protect themselves from this kind of random violence, and he said stop dressing like sluts. And of course the national media, CNN, went bananas; here we go, blaming the victim again. He apologized and retracted his statement, but there was a kernel of truth there which he should have figured out a better way to talk about. There is an element of you\\'ve got to stop dressing provocatively if you\\'re going into a bar in a seedy side of town. I\\'m very conscious of the fact that my granddaughter, she wants to be a princess. She idolizes these popular singers, these women who could just as well be standing up there stark naked as far as I\\'m concerned. So I have mixed feelings about it, and yes we did always look put together when we went to class, but I\\'m not entirely comfortable with women\\'s fashions right now. I\\'ll put it that way. Of course I\\'m sure my granddaughter will win when it comes to any argument. [Laughs] But I would have to admit that I guess I grew up in a pretty conservative household because I\\'m beginning to remember my father wouldn\\'t let me wear those short skirts that we used to wear to the roller rink and roller skating was a really big deal when I was growing up and I just thought that was terrible. I just wouldn\\'t go if I couldn\\'t dress like everybody else. Then of course you become aware of how much young people want to be just like everybody else. They don\\'t want to be different. But I\\'m uneasy about modern fashion, I will say that, and I\\'m not blaming the victim; I\\'m just saying be smart. On the other hand, being smart means knowing how to take care of your self I think, and I won\\'t go any further.',\n",

We were shot every year. People died every year. So when people say to me, \"You bitch, I\\'m going to kill you,\" I didn\\'t go, \"Oh, honey, you don\\'t mean that.\" [Laughs] But when Rebecca was in school, was little and in school, I would pick her up at the school house because I knew that there were men who would victimize her, wouldn\\'t hesitate, so I never left her alone for a second. If she insists on riding the school bus well I followed that school bus, I was right behind the school bus, so she could ride home but I was right there. Why did I start on that? Oh, and so when we came home at night we\\'d come around the bend or we\\'d come down the hill and we\\'d go, \"Oh, look, the house is still standing! Hurray! No one burned us out today,\" and that was reality. \"Oh, good, look! No one burned us out today, hurray!\" And I was really pretty convinced that somebody would kill me.

It's totally different now, I think. We were a radical bunch of women and we were demanding justice, and we learned how to work the system because that's how we were going to get things done. Did I find allies? Actually I found it very difficult to find allies. I remember going up to Highlander way back, gosh, '81, '82, way back, '83, because I was clear that I was doing justice work. It was clear to me. [Laughs] I remember going up to Highlander and I remember getting so pissed off. For many years Highlander was so misogynist, it was just typical of the whole Left male thing that was going on for years, and they didn't have any women in leadership positions, and: This is just a stupid women's thing. They did not get it. They would not get it. They had no interest in talking to me. I couldn't even--. So, no, I could not find allies back then. My allies were other people working with women's issues, so the rape crisis folks were allies, because we were doing the same work, but other than that. I mean we'd find folks in other--. There were legislators that we worked with and we brought people in, but, no, I can't say that there were lots of groups that were--. We found contacts and we brought those people in, like we had our folks with legal aid and we were able to be sure that there was somebody doing domestic violence with legal aid offices, you know, one attorney for God knows how many counties. So we had allies there and we would find legislators and we would find a judge and we had law enforcement, so we had our allies. We knew who to call. I never would tell anybody, call the cops. I would say call so-and-so and talk to so-and-so and don't talk to anybody else, or call so-and-so, mention my name, and tell them I told you to talk to them. It was very specific. You couldn't ever just make a phone call and get anything you needed. You had to work your allies and work the system, and it was who you know and who you blow, who owes you something, who did you do a favor for, who will push a little bit over the edge for you, so that's how it was. No, there weren't, because it was women's stuff and it was not like male people--. [Laughs] The men didn't recognize it as like the work, because it was misogynist. It was a real problem. In the late '60s and early '70s in a lot of progressive organizations--things have changed. The women's movement came up and women demanded changes and a lot of the leadership changed to women, at least fifty percent women.\",\n",

I had contacts in North Carolina and--because there was no way to protect children and women who were getting sexually assaulted. There was no safety. You couldn\\'t depend on the court at all. Very, very often men would get custody of kids that they\\'d been raping for years. It was such a terrible story nobody would believe it was really happening: \"Oh, you\\'re telling a terrible story on your husband,\" or, \"You\\'ve taught these kids to tell this story.\" Well, does that explain the vaginal tears?

       "  'I had a woman friend, her name was Johnnie Ray, so we would help each other, and she was a country woman, the real thing. I\\'m the real thing now, but I wasn\\'t then. She was very helpful to me and taught me a lot of good stuff and we worked in each other\\'s fields. Let me tell you this; this is an important story. So, I don\\'t know if you know Grassy Fork or that area. Back thirty or forty years ago\"all the roads back in there are paved now, which amuses me since my road isn\\'t paved and that\\'s much more of a road\"but it was really a remote section of the county and it was very rough roads. Nothing was paved back in there, which made me happy. I was happy to disappear into the woods. At the fork of the road I lived on there was a cement block building which was probably maybe the size of like the front of the house to the end of the house, maybe thirty feet long and maybe sixteen feet wide. It had a back door and it had a front door and it had two front windows and that was it. There was nothing to it. I was coming out one day and I saw Johnnie\\'s truck parked there so I stopped and looked in and there she was, and I said, \"What are you doing?\" because she had a farm and four kids and she had a son-of-a-bitch for a husband, too. Oh, [Laughs] and I had done the same thing with Johnnie Ray one day. I was out at her place or she\\'d come down to me and Johnnie had all this stuff all over her arms, and I said, \"Johnnie, have you got ringworm or did you run into some poison, or what\\'s going on with you?\" She looked at me like I was really an idiot and she said, \"Those are bruises.\" It turns out that her husband, Paul was just--. He was a drunk and he was the kind that used drink as an excuse and I mean he raped and pillaged and beat. I\\'m sure he raped all of his kids, not to mention Johnnie, and beat her and the kids to a bloody pulp time and time again. Also, lucky for me, he was also a cop fighter so that was greatly in our favor because he fought cops and cops don\\'t like cop fighters. Anyway, I\\'d already found out about the bruising and when I stopped at that building that day and said, \"What are you doing here?\" she said, \"That\\'s a steel door, steel door, got bars over both those windows, and he can\\'t burn this building.\" And so she rented that little building probably for about thirty bucks a month, I don\\'t know, not much. I don\\'t know if there was an outhouse there. It was electric, there was an electric line and she had a refrigerator. She had a little counter not as big as this table and on the counter she had like two loaves of light bread and three onions and some bananas and some Beanie Weenies or something. That was her stock from the store. [Sighs] Many a night Johnnie would run out of the house, grab the kids, and she\\'d lock herself in that building, many, many a night. So, it was Christmas day 1975, probably 2:00 in the afternoon maybe, and I had a call. It was Gracie, one of her daughters, and I guess Gracie was nine. She said, \"Mama says come quick.\" So I jumped in my little VW bug, and she lived probably, I don\\'t know, maybe five miles up the mountain from me. I got up there in time and there was a deputy up there. So Christmas Eve they\\'d finished the tree and got all the presents out and they were waiting for Paul to come home, and he never came home that night. The next morning they waited for him to come home all morning to open presents and he didn\\'t come home. They went ahead and opened presents, and they waited and waited on Christmas dinner for him to come home and he didn\\'t come home, and they\\'d been up all night, so they eat Christmas dinner early and they ate dinner, and she had fallen asleep. Johnnie had fallen asleep on the couch and she woke up and he was standing over her with a knife at her throat saying, \"You\\'re going to die, bitch.\" Johnnie was a strong woman, she\\'d been fighting him for years, and he was drunk, and so they struggled and struggled and struggled. And Gracie went into the bedroom and got the pistol that Johnnie kept loaded under her pillow, because it wasn\\'t the first time this had happened, and Gracie threw the pistol across the room, tossed it across the room to Johnnie--I mean you can just imagine it, screaming [1:02:24]--and Johnnie caught the pistol and it went off. Now he\\'s got the--I mean he\\'s after her with the knife. The bullet slices right through here and gets his--aorta? Is that what it is? And so he was bleeding to death. She called the law and called the ambulance and blah, blah, blah, but he died. I got up there in time. The ambulance had just left and the deputy was just waiting for me to get up there so I could keep the kids so they could haul her off, and they hauled her off to jail, Christmas day, hauled her off to jail, charged her with first degree murder, manslaughter. I think they released her late that night because I think we had the kids back to her the next day. So she was charged with murder, and she was convicted of murder, even though it was clearly self defense. They didn\\'t think anything about convicting her for murder, and then they let her go. And they laughed about it because Paul was a cop fighter and he\\'d had big fights with the cops for years and they hated him and he was always dangerous to them, too. They would make jokes about it: \"Good going, Johnnie!\" and stuff like that. Well she was devastated. I mean the more you suffer the more emotional attachment you have. They\\'d been abused for years horribly, but that d\\nesn\\'t mean the emotional attachment isn\\'t there. It was horrible for her, convicted of murdering her husband who she hated and loved, and being joked about at the courthouse about, \"Good going,\" you know, \"That\\'s great!\" They\\'d pat her on the back; horrible. I discovered in that time that there were no laws [Laughs] to protect family members. Basically a man could assault his family at will, rape, beat, terrorize, whatever he wanted to do, and the law and the preachers and everybody went, oh, well that\\'s his business.',\n",
       "  'So I joined a group of people that were liberating empty buildings and moving families in, and we had people who were good with getting electric turned on and could get the water turned on. I happened to be the lock picker, [Laughs]-- JW: [Laughs] DL: --so I broke into the building and opened it up. We had opened up a university building, and it was just like a tall narrow building and there were five apartments, really nice buildings, and they were going to tear this apartment complex down for a parking lot. It was a good building and they were going to tear this building down, but they weren\\'t going to tear it down for two years. But they evicted everybody. So I had opened the building up and then I came back, probably I guess it must have been sixteen hours later, and my next job was the supply person so I was going through--. Because somebody else had moved all these families in and so my job was to--. And they couldn\\'t leave. You had to occupy it totally for thirty days and then all this legal stuff came in and you could pretty much be there for the year. So I began going up and down and visiting all the people in these apartments to see what they needed, diapers, food, whatever it was they needed. It turned out that all the people that had moved in were women, some h\\nd kids, no men were in the building, and they were all, God, they were Cambridge fellows and they were all academics. So I was visiting these women and I was making a delivery and there was this one woman in there and--I was so young and so na&#239;ve--I asked her--. She was covered in something and I thought it was a rash, she had stuff all over her body. I\\'d just gotten into herbs a little bit so I asked her if she wanted me to bring her something for her rash, did she want some comfrey, I had comfrey, or I had, you know. She looked at me like the idiot I was and she said, \"I don\\'t have a rash,\" and I said, \"Well, gosh, what--?\" Bruises. Every one of those women was a battered woman, every one of them, every one. So that was my first like, whoa. If I\\'d had any preconceptions about women that were hurt, raped, that really knocked--. Because I\\'m sure I was like everybody else and I just sort of assumed everybody was poor or uneducated or something, somebody other than me. Every one of us wants to believe that a woman who\\'s being victimized in some way is someone other than us. It\\'s a terrible thing to realize that that\\'s not true, that all of us are potential victims and you can\\'t tell somebody by looking at them and you can\\'t tell a man who would hurt you by looking at him and we\\'re all vulnerable, every one of us. Education, money, nothing makes any difference. Gender is all. But that was my first lesson, and it was an important lesson early on in my career to note that because it was very helpful.',\n",
       "  \"So we went to England where I had family in London, my father's family was still there, and I found a cottage, just a little thatched roof cottage, in a little village outside of Cambridge and that's where I recovered, really, from that Valium stuff that was just--.

The harassment we all talked about and we all knew about it and it did happen. I was lucky I was never harassed seriously. But if you were, we were traveling on the job and people drank too much so things happened. But my saying no always worked. So that was good. I didn't have any awful experiences.

I'm proud of what we did. I am very disgusted, angry, frustrated over what I see is part of a religious-seeming religious, I guess, I don't know where it's all coming from-of trying to put the genie back in the bottle, trying to put women back into--. And they're using Roe v. Wade and birth control and all. I don't know if it's a generational situation where people are fearful, but I feel like some of the things that we accomplished, we're losing. I mean, to pass a bill that requires the IRS to look into the tax situation of women who have been raped, there's something sick going on. When Congress is spending all this time and our state legislature all this time on all of these non-issues, it's like the war on women. That's what some people are calling it, and I think that's very accurate. I think the war on teachers is almost a war on women. You espouse education as important and, yet, you're trying to take rights away from teachers. I don't get it. So I'm very angry about that because I think we're trying to step back to a time--. And people keep talking about, oh, how it was in the [19]50s. Well, bullshit. (laughs) The '50s were not the be [all] and [end] all. I think women were stuck in family situations.

There was a woman named Francis Woods, a great feminist in Fayetteville, had gone--I can\\'t remember where she went to school now, somewhere in the Northeast; I think maybe Rutgers, but I\\'m not sure, but she had studied there. This was 1976. In getting her degree, she had studied domestic violence. It was being brought up then in an academic and a public way, mainly out of England. And so she came back and she pulled a bunch of us together and she said, \"There\\'s this thing that\\'s happening around that country and it\\'s been happening forever. It\\'s that women are getting raped and beaten within their own marriages. We were like basically, \"Are you sure?\" I mean, it really was such a&#8230; JD: &#8230;It was an unspeakable crime. SP: Yeah, and we had gotten rape and understood rape, but gotten the idea of that and had a lot of politics around that, but this was so hidden and so unspeakable. So we started organizing together and the group of us developed this battered women\\'s shelter, and there were three women who were academics at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville who took out the loan to buy us a house. We ran it off volunteer workers and CETA, and I became the chair of the board as an out lesbian.',\n",

We found that what people were most concerned with was the everyday acts of racial and gender injustice and homophobic violence and religious violence. So, we created this thing called the Women's Watchcare Network, which was funded by the United Methodist Women out of New York, which was a nice thing. So we were going to monitor all of the sexist violence and that, of course, was impossible. We couldn't monitor all the violence against women, so we ended up monitoring just the deaths of women--hundreds. So we would document them, and we monitored extreme acts of racial violence and homophobic violence and religious violence and we held meetings around the state, where we would put people who had experienced religious violence and sexist violence and homophobic violence in the same room and talk to each other. What people discovered is their experience was very, very similar. They could, out of that, bring analysis, understand the connection of that violence--racist, sexist, homophobic and religious.

The basketball team was going to keep them from being able to go to the tournament. We were slammed, both by the black community and by the feminist community because we took a position on both, that it was wrong and also a position about what it meant to be in the state and have your--to be black and basically to be honored academically only for your bodies to be brought into the university, so we rubbed both ways. We were so viciously attacked by the press. I mean, it was enormous, the copies of the articles that were written in relation to us, and the threats that we got on that.',\n",

You often lose connection to community. The biggest failure of the battered women\\'s movement has been our failure to organize women who have come through a shelter. A lot of that has come from a failure to identify across class and across race.',\n",

JR: At first, after that experience, I started doing work in the area of pornography. As I said, my thesis advisor was an addict so he had no problem with me doing research on what he\\'s addicted to, except he didn\\'t say he was addicted but he kept his magazines in his drawer at the university. Okay. Anyway, so I did some experiments, which I didn\\'t realize were experiments. I shouldn\\'t have done them. We did EKGs. We had fourteen volunteers and we got a base run and they [gave] consent. Then we showed different images, and they were definitely resonating, but I thought at the time, like other people, that that would be okay. Well it wasn\\'t okay, not that they complained, but it wasn\\'t. We did a survey of a hundred and forty-seven women about what they thought, so the conflict was always there. They would always say, \"It doesn\\'t bother me,\" basically, and then you ask them questions about their sense of self and the way men look at [them] and it was in complete contrast, complete contrast. So I\\'m thinking, \"Wow; this is really not good, not good.\" So then, the way it led to child sex abuse, I was at my desk one day and I was going to deliver a paper &#8211; we had done a paper &#8211; on the effects of pornography on women, because that\\'s what it was. So I got a hold of this engineering guy &#8211; he was addicted too &#8211; and I asked him, I said, \"Can I have some of your Playboys? He said, \"What do you want them for?\" So I said, \"I\\'m just going to look at them. I just want to go through them.\" He said, \"Well, which ones?\" because he couldn\\'t let go of certain ones, even for&#8211;. [Laughs] He couldn\\'t tell how long I was going to need them. So anyway, I got his stack and I started going through them. Well, anyway, I started going through them and flipping them, and I thought, \"Did I see a kid? Did I? No.\" Then I go back and, \"Yeah; that\\'s a kid. This is a child, and this is not a good picture.\" Okay, it\\'s a cartoon but it\\'s not funny, and it\\'s abuse. Well I thought, \"Okay, that\\'s one. Will there be more?\" So I\\'m flipping and there\\'s another one, and I\\'m flipping, and another one. So then I went back and started to look at the totality of the magazine and realized that Playmate has &#8211; are children they have the little pictures of children, and I&#8211;. Whoa! This is not good. There\\'s going to be child sexual abuse here. This is not innocent. Then my daughter was raped by the boy upstairs, who was thirteen, at which point I realized later that laws had been changed to accommodate the fact that [if] a boy of thirteen abuses a girl of ten there\\'s a little peer exception rule so that they can rape kids. What is this about? So all this starts to add up, and my daughter, her reaction to this rape &#8211; it was over a year until I found out &#8211; was indicative of&#8211;. And the boy had stacks of Playboy. His father collected Playboy and they were up in his closet, stacks of it, but I\\'d never connected all these things. I mean I knew because I knew the mother and she mentioned it, and I thought at the time, \"That\\'s silly. What man looks at that? My goodness!\" But I never thought more than that about it. So then the connection is made between Playboy and the rapes, and it turns out that my daughter wasn\\'t the only one. It was the neighbor children, boys and girls. This kid was molesting them, and he was getting therapy, so the therapist wasn\\'t permitted to tell any of the neighbors or anybody, warn anybody that we had a predator in our midst, because there\\'s [doctor-patient] privilege.

JR: Yeah, so I have that background. My daughter doesn\\'t want me to talk to anybody but I get permission to tell my friend, Carol. I call my friend Carol and I tell her. She\\'s in Berkeley. She\\'s as Berkeley as you can get. I tell her, \"Carol, this is what happened to Jenny and I\\'m so upset,\" and she says, \"Judy, you don\\'t understand. Children are sexual from birth. She probably kind of wanted this experience,\" and I said, \"No, she didn\\'t. Thank you very much,\" and I hung up. Then I called my aunt in Maryland, matriarch kind of lady, couldn\\'t be more different, and I tell her what happened and she says, \"Well, Judy, you have to understand, children are sexual from birth. She was probably a little interested,\" and so on. Now, I have been a communist-type and I know a party line when I hear a party line, and how you have a party line bridging those\\nkinds of areas, geographically and experientially and politically, there\\'s still agreement, the same? She writes about it now, Linda Bartlett. EF: Right. JR: It\\'s wonderful. EF: So, if I can ask, how did your daughter deal with that terrible experience and how did you, as a parent and as a researcher, also put it all together? JR: Well for a year, she didn\\'t deal with it well because we didn\\'t know. I didn\\'t know. Once she said what happened, and in those years we didn\\'t know to call it rape, so I said, \"Well you were seduced. You were seduced.\" She said he had her shoes and she couldn\\'t go. It didn\\'t matter to her, I suppose. It\\'s okay, the words. I said, \"It wasn\\'t your fault,\" and so on. EF: Sure. JR: And I couldn\\'t do anything about him because the woman had sent him back to England. They apparently knew. They heard from the other kids so they got rid of the kid. So then, it took a little while, but she was okay after she told me and we told her father &#8211; I got permission &#8211; and he handled it okay: \"It\\'s not your fault,\" and so on. But I couldn\\'t help but wonder if the brain aneurysm that she had, that she died from really, had something to do with that.',\n",

Children were becoming aggressive. Actually there was an increase in not only aggressivity but murder wherever, as the television came into the children\\'s lives, and yet that was not reported in the papers either. A Surgeon General\\'s Commission, 1972? It never saw headlines? Headlines should have been: \"Television causes children to be violent.

       "  \"just irrelevant. EF: Why so? JR: Women are reacting to their loss. They don't know often that they're reacting to their loss but they are. EF: Just to clarify, loss of what? JR: Of their womanhood, of their honor, of their integrity that they did have. There were problems pre-feminism. There were, you know. There were problems in the workplace, or there were problems in fair employment, other things that are not right, but now they've lost who they are as women. They're treated like slabs of meat. This hook-up business: all part of the idea of feminism. [Sighs] And the rate of divorce, the rate of abortion, of venereal disease, all these things, they are examples of women who have come to believe frauds and who have given up their womanhood. They've given up their womanhood. We have a lot of women who are molesting children, women teachers molesting children. Something radical has happened to the character of our people, and this radical thing that has happened has happened to women. In my life &#8211; and it's not imagination &#8211; women didn't do those things. Somebody might, some weird gal might, but women, molesting children? When women start molesting children the last barrier of protection for them is gone. So, we're in a very dangerous place.\",\n",
       "  'JR: Sure. It\\'s child abuse. There\\'s no transfer. There\\'s no transfer. The high rate of child abuse amongst what are called \"gay and lesbian,\" and what are called \"transgender,\" and what are called \"queer,\" and what are called all those other kinds of names is off the charts, except nobody wants to address that. I did my research using The Advocate. Do you know what The Advocate is? EF: I\\'ve heard of it. JR: It\\'s the mainstream. It\\'s the oldest and the mainstream homosexual magazine. EF: Okay. JR: You can\\'t get anything that\\'s more mainstream than The Advocate. I did research along with a statistician on The Advocate and they &#8211; admissions on their part &#8211; twenty-one percent of their readers, who are the basically white, upscale, urban, basically these are the guys, are sexually abused before age fifteen by adults. Now, they left out sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen. The sixteen and seventeen, those years, would be your biggest abuse populations. They didn\\'t count those and they didn\\'t count older kids as abusers. Okay? Alright. Even still, twenty-one percent are talking about they were sexually abused. What are you doing? You\\'re turning your back on twenty-one percent? Now, what they\\'ve done &#8211; and the same thing with lesbians. There was a Dutch [study], I think it was, and fifty-some percent of the kids were abused. What they do is the abused kids are mislabeled gay. What you do is you have an abused kid and instead of finding out who\\'s abused them and putting him in jail &#8211; you don\\'t see many abusers of gay kids put in jail unless they\\'re priests. Instead of getting the people who have violated them, the perpetrators, they say, \"Oh, well, they\\'re gay. They\\'re gay.\" So that means they\\'re going to die earlier, they\\'re going to have all kinds of venereal diseases and everything else that they don\\'t need to have. Instead of protecting those children, instead of protecting those people, we\\'re labeling those people, labeling them. It may be politically acceptable today but it\\'s not going to help them. So, that\\'s my position.',\n",
       "  'JR: Yeah, actually he did. EF: &#8211;in DC? JR: Yeah, yeah. He went all over. In Los Angeles they were about to tighten the laws on predators. He went to Los Angeles and he lied. He testified that children are not harmed by sexual abuse, that he had investigated thousands of children and [no, there\\'s no harm,] and so on and so on. As a matter of fact Kinsey acolytes, John Money and Fred Berlin, and another guy, Peterson, they advised the Catholic Church that pedophiles could be cured and could go back. So, that little tidbit was interesting. But the main thing was the laws on rape&#8211;. Estrich &#8211; that\\'s her name? I\\'ve forgotten her first name. She wrote an article in the Yale Law Review on rape, and she was Dukakis\\'s lawyer or something. She\\'s very popular and she wrote an article in the Yale Law Review on rape and she said, \"What has happened to the rape laws?\" She said, \"With the conservatives we had tougher penalties for rape than we have with the liberals,\" and she\\'s very liberal. She said the America Law Institute Model Penal Code&#8211;. Do you know anything about that? EF: Not really. JR: It\\'s the code that\\'s gone all over the country. The Model Penal Code supplanted&#8211;. You had the Common Law and you have now a belief in science, okay, which supplanted the Common Law. Science supplanted the Common Law. Well, what science? What science? Science on rape. What science on rape? What science on child abuse? What science on divorce? What science on sodomy? The Model Penal Code from 1955, and who do they cite in the Model Penal Code a hundred percent on sodomy and on rape? The Kinsey Institute, Alfred Kinsey. So, in 1948 half the states in the union had a penalty of death for rape &#8211; did you know that? &#8211; simple rape, not cutting off the arms, not a little kid, just a regular male-female kind of rape, the old fashioned kind. You know that\\'s changed. The kind of rape we deal with now has changed. It\\'s radically changed. But anyway, so, rape. Half the states offered the death penalty, the other half, life. You could get life for rape, and one of them you could get forty years. Okay. What does that tell you about the attitude, the relationship between women and men at that time? You believe the woman who said she was raped because virginity was a prized property of hers. She wouldn\\'t say she was raped and risk the fact that she was no longer a virgin. Kinsey came along and said: these women are all lying. They\\'re really promiscuous. They &#8211; fornication was against the law &#8211; they have engaged in fornication. But there\\'s no downside to anything. There was never a downside. He didn\\'t have a downside. He didn\\'t have abortion. He didn\\'t have venereal disease. He didn\\'t have child sexual abuse that wasn\\'t considered child sexual abuse. There was no downside to anything that he said we participated in. We were all promiscuous and it\\'s just that Grandpa and Grandma were hiding it. They were liars. Get it? So, that led me into an investigation of the laws.',\n",
       "  'JR: Yeah. [Brief interruption] Well, first thing I did is I read. I read what he wrote, what he said, and it\\'s there. It\\'s in his two books. Chapter five shows a two-month-old baby being masturbated, or digitally manipulated &#8211; or maybe penetrated, because later on one of his colleagues said that they did involve penetration &#8211; for a certain amount of time in order to get an orgasm. Then he has a three-month-old, four-month-old, five-month-old, six-month-old, and he lists these little children, and that\\'s torture. That\\'s what they were doing to the little babies. Tables 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and what he called&#8211;. Then I looked. I said, okay. Alright. Okay, so these are what he said, that they did over &#8211; and the timing, how long it took to get the orgasm, and the time in between orgasms of the kids, and I said okay; what did he call an orgasm? I thought sure the guy would have not described it, but he did. Page 160 and 161. He said that there were one hundred and ninety-six children and he broke them up into six categories, six types &#8211; that\\'s what he called it, six types &#8211; one, two, three, four, five, six. That made it very scientific. It\\'s got numbers and everything, you see? Then he said that the children screamed, they cried, hysterical tears, and he put in parentheses, \"Especially among the younger children.\" What? What? Then he said, \"And some strike the partner.\" That\\'s the man who was raping them. Excuse me. \"Strike the partner and try and get away.\" Yeah? \"But,\" he said, \"they definitely enjoy the experience because they often return to&#8211;,\" and I thought, \"Holy smokes! This is got to be a sadomasochistic&#8211;.\" Do you want to see the charts and all that? EF: Perhaps after the interview. JR: I said, \"He has got to be a sadomasochistic pedophile.\" I mean, that\\'s what he\\'s got to be. There\\'s no human being who could describe babies writhing in pain and say that they enjoyed that as an orgasm but a sadomasochistic pedophile, so that means he was a pedophile. And this is the most quoted science in the world on sex? This is the science that we base sex education on, and this is the science that churches say children are sexual from birth based on? EF: So you produced some of your findings, and how was it received in the academic community over the 1970s and 1980s? JR: Well first, before I did that, I was supposed to research Kinsey and Playboy. The Department of Justice&#8211;. EF: Right. JR: Yeah. I was principal investigator. EF: At American University, or it was funded through there? JR: Yeah, American University. EF: This was in 1984, somewhere in that&#8211;? JR: Yeah. The trouble was the president was a pedophile. The trouble was&#8211;. EF: The president of American University? JR: Of American University, yeah, was a pedophile. The trouble was the head of the psych department was apparently a pedophile too. He was supposed to have [had] sex with a little nine-year-old girl in his trailer park at a nudist colony, Elliott McGinnies, so I had a lot of trouble at the university getting my research approved and so on. I don\\'t know how many others because birds of a feather flock together. You try to make sure that nobody\\'s going to squeal on you, that you have around you the right people, because otherwise somebody may tell. Somebody may report you or something. So I was supposed to do the research on Kinsey at American University. The Department of Justice &#8211; this was under Reagan, the last great chance anybody ever had to do any research &#8211; so then my grant hit all kinds of trouble. Well, I did know, but it turns out Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, they were all lobbying American University. They were going crazy because they thought I would find what I found. So they were threatening them, and the Kinsey Institute was threatening them, and I was sitting there in my office, trying to do my study. So then the Kinsey Institute threatened to sue them if American University let me do what I was going to do, so they cut out academic freedom, thank you very much. So they cut out any ability of me to research Kinsey\\'s work, which was ridiculous because I wasn\\'t experimenting. He was, but I wasn\\'t. I was going to look at the documents and try and find out where the children came from, because we had a lot of leads at that time. He\\'d gone into the orphanages and into the homes of the colored children &#8211; in those years &#8211; and so we were checking those out, but they cut our throats. They said, \"No way. You\\'re not going to do that research.\" EF: So American didn\\'t allow it? JR: Mm hmm. EF: They didn\\'t publish it? JR: No. They didn\\'t allow me to do the research. EF: Oh, I see. JR: The academic committee of respectable academics was the one that said, \"No, you can\\'t do that. You can\\'t.\" So, okay, but they let me do the Playboy stuff. EF: Okay. JR: You can look at Playboy. So I figured well; if that\\'s all we can do that\\'s all we can do. So we did the research on Playboy and found that they had been sexualizing children from 1954 and had engaged in what is now known as child pornography regularly. That seems important. The public needs to know that. Grandpa and Father weren\\'t looking at innocuous stuff. He thought he was looking at innocuous things but they weren\\'t innocuous because the way they work on the brain leaves no doubt that they work on the brain. They\\'re what we call \"flashbulb memories,\" that is everyone remembers that first nude that they saw, everyone, and they remember, in those days, because it\\'s not like now on the iPads and everything else, and they remember where they were and who they were with when they saw that sexy image. They remember everything and they remember the cartoons. They remember all the cartoons. How do I know that? Because of a lot of research I\\'ve done since, but the fellow who told me about Kinsey, who said go look at Kinsey? When I saw him earlier I said, \"There are kids in Playboy,\" and he said, \"No, there aren\\'t,\" and I said, \"Yeah, there are,\" and he said, \"No, there aren\\'t.\" He\\'s a psychologist and he knows. [I said,] \"So you know Playboy?\" and he said, \"Well, yeah, I\\'ve seen it, and there aren\\'t.\" EF: How were you defining&#8211;? What constituted \"children?\" JR: Under eighteen. EF: Okay. JR: Under eighteen. EF: Did you do research to find out who&#8211;? Like some of them were cartoons, but for those that were photos did you look into who they were? JR: Yep.

       "  'Well, first thing I did is I read. I read what he wrote, what he said, and it\\'s there. It\\'s in his two books. Chapter five shows a two-month-old baby being masturbated, or digitally manipulated &#8211; or maybe penetrated, because later on one of his colleagues said that they did involve penetration &#8211; for a certain amount of time in order to get an orgasm. Then he has a three-month-old, four-month-old, five-month-old, six-month-old, and he lists these little children, and that\\'s torture. That\\'s what they were doing to the little babies. Tables 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and what he called&#8211;. Then I looked. I said, okay. Alright. Okay, so these are what he said, that they did over &#8211; and the timing, how long it took to get the orgasm, and the time in between orgasms of the kids, and I said okay; what did he call an orgasm? I thought sure the guy would have not described it, but he did. Page 160 and 161. He said that there were one hundred and ninety-six children and he broke them up into six categories, six types &#8211; that\\'s what he called it, six types &#8211; one, two, three, four, five, six. That made it very scientific. It\\'s got numbers and everything, you see? Then he said that the children screamed, they cried, hysterical tears, and he put in parentheses, \"Especially among the younger children.\" What? What? Then he said, \"And some strike the partner.\" That\\'s the man who was raping them. Excuse me. \"Strike the partner and try and get away.\" Yeah? \"But,\" he said, \"they definitely enjoy the experience because they often return to&#8211;,\" and I thought, \"Holy smokes! This is got to be a sadomasochistic&#8211;.\" Do you want to see the charts and all that? EF: Perhaps after the interview. JR: I said, \"He has got to be a sadomasochistic pedophile.\" I mean, that\\'s what he\\'s got to be. There\\'s no human being who could describe babies writhing in pain and say that they enjoyed that as an orgasm but a sadomasochistic pedophile, so that means he was a pedophile. And this is the most quoted science in the world on sex? This is the science that we base sex education on, and this is the science that churches say children are sexual from birth based on? EF: So you produced some of your findings, and how was it received in the academic community over the 1970s and 1980s? JR: Well first, before I did that, I was supposed to research Kinsey and Playboy. The Department of Justice&#8211;. EF: Right. JR: Yeah. I was principal investigator. EF: At American University, or it was funded through there? JR: Yeah, American University. EF: This was in 1984, somewhere in that&#8211;? JR: Yeah. The trouble was the president was a pedophile. The trouble was&#8211;. EF: The president of American University? JR: Of American University, yeah, was a pedophile. The trouble was the head of the psych department was apparently a pedophile too. He was supposed to have [had] sex with a little nine-year-old girl in his trailer park at a nudist colony, Elliott McGinnies, so I had a lot of trouble at the university getting my research approved and so on. I don\\'t know how many others because birds of a feather flock together. You try to make sure that nobody\\'s going to squeal on you, that you have around you the right people, because otherwise somebody may tell. Somebody may report you or something. So I was supposed to do the research on Kinsey at American University. The Department of Justice &#8211; this was under Reagan, the last great chance anybody ever had to do any research &#8211; so then my grant hit all kinds of trouble. Well, I did know, but it turns out Playboy, Penthouse, Hustler, they were all lobbying American University. They were going crazy because they thought I would find what I found. So they were threatening them, and the Kinsey Institute was threatening them, and I was sitting there in my office, trying to do my study. So then the Kinsey Institute threatened to sue them if American University let me do what I was going to do, so they cut out academic freedom, thank you very much.

       "  'Yes. [Hugh] Hefner said he was reading Kinsey, he was a virgin in college and he was reading Kinsey, and he would be Kinsey\\'s pamphleteer. Yeah? Then I was delivering my paper on women and their reactions to pornography and so on at the British Psychological Association [conference on love and attraction], and Tom O\\'Carroll, a pedophile, who headed the Pedophile Information Exchange in England where they had a list of how you get kids, where you find them and all, was coming to our conference. I knew that a group of people at the conference were pedophiles, or just deviants and perverts, because they were on the Penthouse \"Forum.\" So it\\'s complicated. All the academicians there at this conference, except me, said that Tom O\\'Carroll, freedom of speech, he should come and he should speak about pedophilia as a viable exchange, and I said, \"Heck no. [We were in Wales.] We\\'re guests of the people and we have no right to bring in a pedophile who advocates raping their kids, and then we leave and they\\'re left with that talk from an academic institution? No. Never.\" So I was the only one who said that. Everybody else thought it was a freedom of speech, right, which says a lot about our academic sensibility, in my opinion. Anyway, so I was presenting my paper and a psychologist that was there came up to me and said, \"If you really are concerned about child sexual abuse,\" because that was in the Playboy, he says, \"You have to look at Kinsey,\" and I said, \"Why?\" I mean, I knew Kinsey, so I said, \"Why?\" So he said, \"I worked with Kinsey and with Wardell Pomeroy. One is a pedophile and the other is a homosexual.\" So I said, \"Which is which?\" and he said, \"Read and discover,\" and he walked out of the room and walked out of my life. I can\\'t find him. So, I did. I read and I discovered. So that\\'s how the connection came between &#8211; and Kinsey was the man who said, \"Children are sexual from birth.\" Nobody had said that before him, and Playboy drew it in their cartoon. So the picture echoed the position of Kinsey, and that\\'s been disastrous for children. It\\'s been disastrous. Children are spiritual from birth. There\\'s nothing biblical that says that they\\'re sexual. There\\'s nothing that defines children as sexual at all, and skipping past biblically, if we\\'re talking anatomically and biologically, no. That\\'s not true. The churches have accepted it, a lot of them: we have to have sex education because children are sexual. What? There isn\\'t the slightest reason to believe that. They\\'re sexualized. They\\'re hyper-sexualized by our society, by the mass media, but left to their own lives, living, that\\'s not true at all, not at all. So that\\'s how I got involved.',\n",

SR: Absolutely. It all came about at the same time. While we were marching to have the right to vote, women in the Northeast were also marching against the Vietnam War, and after they stopped marching, or during the same time that they marched against the Vietnam War, they also started burning bras. And the National Organization of Women became a national movement, a national power, and now it\\'s politically correct for some women to say, \"I\\'m not a feminist,\" \"I don\\'t believe in feminism,\" but feminism is what changed for working women, particularly the white middle-class woman. It changed her life for the better, because she was no longer afraid to step out and speak out against what she felt was discrimination against her. All of this was a result of the civil rights movement in the sixties and the decade of change from the late fifties to the early seventies, that people were wanting a different America. It was an America that did not want to fight the Vietnamese war. It was an America that had women suing because they were sexually harassed on the job, women suing because they were passed over for promotion and less-qualified men got the job. Women suing because they were called the n-word on the job and terminated. Any number of categories: gender--. And one of the worst categories, I think, in my practice of civil rights, was where the employer was not overtly violating the law. He didn\\'t do the overt things, like call you a bitch or use the n-word or just say, \"I\\'m firing you because you didn\\'t sleep with me.\" But what they did, many employers engaged in invidious campaigns of hostile work environment harassment, where day in and day out when the complaining party came to work, there was always something done to harass them, to upset them, to force them into quitting their job. And these were some of the things that women really started suing about in the seventies and the eighties.',\n",
       "  \"We also had a lot of women that filed complaints due to wage disparity issues. The white females seemingly filed more than the African American females did in the area of wage discrimination. Most of the African American females, theirs would say discrimination. They saw it as race, but it turned out to be when you looked at their case closely, it was race and it was gender. And it was hostile work environment harassment, due to sexual harassment or due to gender based, non-sexual harassment. One of the proudest accomplishments I have is that I had a partner, Helen Larson, who li\\nes in Washington, D.C. now, but along with professor Grayford Gray of the UT College of Law, he was our mentor. And we developed the first mediation handbook for the Tennessee Human Rights Commission. And we were--. We both left before we solved the final book, which I was told they did adopt. But both of us left the commission. I went into private practice and Helen moved to Washington, D.C. to work with the--. She was the president of the LPM association, and she went there to work for them. But when we were together, we found so many companies guilty of discrimination that the people that were the administrators of the Human Rights Commission, they asked us to review some of our findings. And one woman said that we needed to reverse one of our findings, and we wouldn't do it. So we left. We would never change any of our findings to suit--. JF: You were actually getting pressure from folks above you at the Commission to--. SR: Absolutely. JF: --to not find in favor of--. SR: Absolutely, at that time, yes. Her name's Helen Larson, I think she's still alive. And we refused to change any of our rulings. And we found a lot of--. It was sickening, the amount of sexual harassment that was going on to women who were employed. Women who worked as waitresses, women who worked in restaurants and nightclubs, women who worked in hotels as maids. Women who had jobs that were physicists, that were scientists. It just ran the gamut of sexual harassment in the workplace. When I was in private practice, one of the biggest things that I saw coming, just before I retired, was that there was an awful lot of women being harassed on the job with internet pornography. The internet pornography was exploding. It exploded from Jellico, Tennessee, to Knoxville, Tennessee to wherever you were, it didn't matter how small the town was, how large the town was. On a military base, in a trucking company, in a federal installation. Men were having great issues with feeling that they had the right to look at pornography during work hours in the workplace. And I think that many workplaces have got in their handbooks that that is now a reason that you could be disciplined or terminated. But it was just awful.\",\n",
       "  'SR: They didn\\'t use the term \"sexually harassment\" as much as they did, \"He wanted me to sleep with him or I would be fired.\" \"He got in my face with his fist and said if I told it, I would be fired.\" One of the landmark sexual harassment cases in the country, came out of Tennessee and it was Hicks. And Hicks was a case in which the employer had made his employee reach in his pants pocket and take money out of his pants pocket to get money to get paid or whatever. Or for whatever it was that he wanted her to do that for, but it was a case that set the standard that you could be found guilty of sexual harassment and damages could be rewarded for psychological damages. Because at one time, the psychological damages were not a part of the remedies for a sexual harassment discrimination lawsuit. So now, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent emotional infliction of emotional distress, and whatever traumas you experience due to the sexual harassments you experienced on the job, is actionable and recoverable.',\n",

Like there were local chapters of the National Organization of Women during that time, and then there were a few groups that were regionally identified like the Coalition of Appalachian Women, and things like that.

       "  'This was 1968 that I went canoeing on a river with some friends, and other people left and I was waiting on a couple of people to come back with a canoe, and we didn\\'t really know where we were. But I met a family there and the man was being abusive to his three-year-old daughter, and I am sure it was clear on my face that I didn\\'t approve. She had hit him, and he had hit her, and then she had hit him. But he was hitting her until she had red splotches all over, and he had been drinking, and I could tell the mother was really upset. We were in a very remote picnic area. It was getting dark and the man offered to go up and let me look down and see if I could see my compatriots, and if I didn\\'t I was going to go back into - I was up near Cookville, Tennessee. Anyway, without the gory details, he ended up beating me up and raping me, and I was twenty one at the time. But the thing that has ended up about that experience is that I had never had a violent experience before, never been in a violent situation. My parents were very gentle people. Most of the people I knew were gentle people, so I had never come up against violence in that way. But what he kept saying-and he was almost in a trance-what he kept saying over and over again is that \"I have killed women and children in Vietnam and I can crack your neck with one hand.\" He just kept saying that over and over about Vietnam. He was a Vietnam vet. Later I commented to someone, they said, \"Who raped you?\" And I said, \"The war.\" Because I really came to see it that way. I didn\\'t prosecute because of my father\\'s health. I actually ended up knowing who he was because his wife had given me his business card, because she liked my dog, and she had no idea. I think she must have sensed that something happened, because I took him back and I was all beaten up, and I just let him out of the car and drove off. He had no idea that I had his business card in my pocket. I just could not do that to my parents. They would have never gotten a night\\'s rest about me. It was hard enough for them for me to be on my own. But that is what has haunted me about that period of time. So I am very sensitive about violence towards women, sexual violence, but I am also sensitive about what wars do to people. I think if women made those decisions, as they do in some Native American cultures-in the Cherokee culture, it is the women who tell the men whether to go to war or not-I don\\'t think women would kill each other\\'s children quite so hastily. I just think that it is a sad situation that our world, and that our particular society in America, does not have as part of the tightest threads of its fabric the wisdom of women. That they don\\'t take it seriously.',\n",

I think that really helped put us in the public arena to get people thinking and talking, and people who might not actually want to be seen with us identifying with us privately and quietly, and that can reflect itself in the ballot box or sometimes in a checkbook. I think those issues did help, people could identify with those. We've made a lot of progress in terms of raising public awareness on those issues and made some law changes but the underlying problem still exists and I see it all the time in my practice. I practice a lot of domestic law and violence and people quietly hiding their secret of violence in their home goes on every day still. It's very difficult to root that out, and that may be fundamentally a disrespect issue and you disrespect the people who aren't equal. If they're not as good as you and they're not entitled to the same opportunity then they're somehow a subspecies.\",\n",

There was literally nothing that could be done so I decided that maybe just embarrassing him or getting somebody superior to him to talk to him, maybe that would take care of it. So I went to see the department head who sent me on to see a dean and their response to me was, well that's what you get if you're going to be out in the world.

And some of the gentlemen that were very involved from Norman came up and asked me if I would run. I really wasn t too eager to do that, either, but there was a reason I needed to do that.

Well, I remarked earlier that I was pro-choice in my first time in office. Well then I had a very powerful religious conversion, and when I came back I was pro-life which has been the source of a great deal of controversy surrounding me. As part of that process, I was the primary author of the House Bill 1686 in 2005. That was the bill that broke the log jam. There was a 30-year log jam on pro-life legislation, and getting that through changed that. Now a big part of that change was the republican takeover of the House. It changed the climate quite a bit, too but it took all of us. I think that s something that people don t realize. We desperately need both parties to be working together on things that matter and not trying to shoot each other down all the time. That s terrible for the people, terrible for the country. I passed that. Let s see I passed a bill saying that you couldn t put rape victims private information on the Internet, which I thought was very important. I passed another pro-life bill, and both of these bills required informed consent before abortion. They required parental consent for minors. The first bill said that if you murder a pregnant woman you can be charged with the death of the baby as well as the death of the woman. Then the second bill basically dealt with funding and some of those issues. I passed that. There again, that was actually Representative John Wright s 11 Finchum Hamilton Finchum Hamilton bill, but in order to get it through I had to author it at the final thing, and that s an example of both parties working together.

I kept listening to this bill and these other women on the committee, these big Equal Rights Amendment supporters, who were saying, Oh, yeah. Great. That s just so American, you know, freedom of choice. I was thinking, What is wrong with this picture? So I finally got up my nerve and asked my first question, and that was, How would you write the job description for the executioner? I mean, we re talking about people. One of the lines of the bill was, You may choose to die in the way you did in your victim. It was kind of screw-y language, and then everybody started looking at the language and so, finally, we defeated the bill, the alternate death penalty bill. But it was just a strange bill.

Knowing that you\\'re watching something that\\'s going to be with her for the rest of her life. So, just so many layers of stuff. You know, the guy who has, what\\'s considered a typical, certain kind of guy problem and how he, and his, the way he\\'s trying to frame it in ways so it looks like something else. \"I did not have sex with that woman, or intercourse, with that woman.\" So everyone\\'s going, \"Oh so, hm, what does that mean?\" And you know, just so many interesting layers.

I always want to call it trial, because it felt like a trial. And just the controversy about it and it had all these senators acting astonished, shocked, shocked that--that men came onto women, you know, during work, and it was just--it was so--nowadays, you know, we have a scandal a week. Back then it was more, you know, the senate, there weren't any women. And it was, you know, this bastion of basic white maleness. And we know what, you know, that much maleness means anywhere. You know there's going to be some of that stuff just because of human nature and these senators acting so agog at the idea that, you know, of sexual harassment. And it just felt like the height of hypocrisy. And I just remember watching it. It was like watching a soap opera. And so I wrote about that, you know, I wrote about black men in basketball, because I'd written about my dad. And I just wrote all these opinion pieces, and I just--but I was still amazed when Milton Coleman asked me if I wanted to be a metro columnist, cause, I mean, it was a dream come true had I dared to dream it. I didn't--the idea of writing opinion every day, you know, or twice a week was terrifying, because it meant putting myself out there and exposing myself. And I knew that I wasn't going to write the typical metro column with distance, because I really didn't know how to write like that, not opinion, it has to be personal, it has to be intimate. And there was nobody writing that column that I was reading. And I remember thinking, okay, I'll just tell him, you know, I want to write a weird column that goes to all these different places that nobody goes. He says you can write about whatever you want. I was like, dag(ph). He wasn't going to give me that out. And I was dating my husband at that point, who was also a journalist, and I remember telling him, he was at the Dallas Morning News, and telling him, you know what happened, Milton Coleman wants me to write a column.

Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I wrote about Tyson, I wrote about O.J. [O.J. Simpson] (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: Mike Tyson was accused of raping a young lady in Indianapolis [Indiana], I guess, at the Expo [Indiana Black Expo]? Speaker 2: --Yeah, the girl was, you know, an eighteen year old Sunday school teacher, a virgin. And I remember how there were all these black women who came out in support of Tyson. And I--it's a phenomena that I came to understand. You know Darrell's death in some ways made that understandable for me because of--there's this innate and reflexive need to protect black men because of our history, because ours are the men that get dragged into the night. I mean, we have that history from slavery and Jim Crow, and from, you know, my brother [Darrell Britt]. And so the idea that we have to protect black men and we have to support them no matter what, even in a situation like that where, you know, Mike Tyson had a history of violent behavior. You know with--because at that point, he'd been with Robin Givens and that didn't go well, and that people supported him, women supported him was wild. It just shows you, I think, how deep this protective impulse goes, how deep that history goes. Speaker 1: Okay-- Speaker 2: Marion Barry, wrote about him. You know there's always lots of stuff\",\n",

We were very young and it could have been consensual, but I did remember saying, \"No.\" But, I don\\'t think my life right now, I would be where I am now if I had gone through with that because you can really hurt other people and I, when I talked to his parents, his parents was, you know, it, it could have gone any, any way. It could, it could have been that I could\\'ve agreed just by going into the room. It\\'s just so many ways that you can look at it you know. And I know back in that day, you know, rape, rape is rape no matter what. But I do not remember saying to him, \"Let\\'s go to the next step.\" But I did go into his dorm, so a lot of that weighted on that, you know, in my decision. And when I dropped those chor-, charges, those charges being dropped was weighted on the fact that I could mess up his life and maybe mess up my life as well. So I weighed it on that and we both live good lives now, you know. I, I, went on to graduate from college, he graduated from college, he lives a prosperous life. But you know those things would not be there for him. I remember going to the c-, the jail in Greenwood [Mississippi] and seeing him behind bars, you know, that, that left a mark on me because I, I look at it now and look at how the systems are set up, you know, it, it\\'s gotta always be a place where we can come and meet and say, you know what, I made a mistake, you made a mistake. And I think at that time I wasn\\'t smart enough, but something inside of me was smart enough for me to recognize that I did not wanna mess up his life because a mis-, a mistake that the two of us had made. So when I moved from that point to there--and I later on went on to, to date a professor (laughter) at the university so, it\\'s, you know, I, I had a really good life as, you know, as a, as a, as a student at the university.',\n",

I think a lot of what I was dealing with at that time, the repeated abuse and just really not knowing who I was, you know. You don\\'t know who you are at th-, at that age; you\\'re just trying to find out who you are and just trying to establish a personality for me. I just lashed out at everybody. I wanted; I wanted to have everybody on my hit list basically. And I just wanted to beat \\'em up, or just to say that I could beat \\'em up and never wen\\n through with it really. I was a major bully in my, in my school. I just picked on kids for no reason; I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever shared that with anyone (laughter). But I, I do remember being a bully, you know.

I still have a good relationship with, with the people who abused me. I don\\'t think of them any longer as monsters because, you know, they were going through transitions as well and it\\'s just one of those things that happens in life that you just have to kind of like watch all of your children.

I'd actually never thought about it before now, how much attention I give to kids and abuse issues.

Speaker 2: I did, when we were young, I grew up at Fairwood and Livingston. I went, Fairwood Elementary [Fairwood Elementary School; Fairwood Alternative Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] is where I went to kindergarten, and we had an apartment there. And that's probably where I spent--until I was nine years old that was the community we lived in. And then, when my mother married John Porter [ph.], we moved up to the Brittany Hills area [Columbus, Ohio], where Ohio Dominican College [Ohio Dominican University] is. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, now is that a move up in the neighborhood or? Speaker 2: It was, we got a house. John, she married John, and he bought a house so, you know, it was probably about a thousand square foot house and three bedrooms, no air conditioning, but it was a house. We had a basement. We had a backyard. We really thought we were moving up. I actually thought we were middle class until I got to college [Ohio University, Athens, Ohio], and they told me I was underprivileged so (laughter). But, you know, I, I want to go back to that. I don't want that childhood memory to be at that pedophile. I should think of something happy of a childhood memory 'cause that's a bad one, but it's odd-- Speaker 1: (Unclear) earlier than that? I\",\n",
       "  'the cases that came before you that you can talk about? Can you talk about some of them? Speaker 2: Oh, sure. I mean, I, I dealt with any number of cases. We dealt with, not only divorces and dissolutions because we were a combined family court, but my toughest cases were dealing with bind over cases, you know, decisions where you had to, you had to make a decision about whether you help a juvenile in juvenile court or transfer them to adult court. Dealing with children who were raped by their parent\\'s boyfriends or live-ins, some of the horrific abuse that I saw happened to kids. It, it was, it was a challenging court to be on. You can\\'t even begin to imagine what people do, or will allow to be done to their children. It, it was shocking for me. And so, one of the things that I did, as I said to my staff, I said, \"You know, look, we know we have six years. I don\\'t know if they\\'re going to give me more than that, but we know we have six.\" And the one thing I know about black robes is when you put them on, suddenly, the media cares what you have to say. And so, I made it very intentional to talk about abused children and how the system was treating them and pushing for improvement in how we dealt with these cases. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, we live in a time of increasing public scrutiny of certain kinds of crimes of that nature. Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: People abused, \\'Oprah Winfrey Show\\' [\\'The Oprah Winfrey Show\\'], or these talk shows-- Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: --talk about these, but you\\'re seeing things at another level. Speaker 2: Oh-- Speaker 1: You\\'re seeing people actually walk in-- Speaker 2: Absolutely. Speaker 1: --on a level of intensity and we, we can\\'t imagine. Speaker 2: I had, I will never forget this. I had a twelve year old who was pregnant by her mother\\'s boyfriend. And the mother kept trying to convince me that he didn\\'t do it. And I said, I finally looked at her, and I said, \"Ma\\'am, we have the DNA. You can try to get your daughter to recant all you want to. That is his baby.\" And she looked at me, and she said, \"Why do you keep babying her about this? She can get over it. I got over it, she can get over it.\" This is this child\\'s mother, and she forced this twelve year old--and I\\'m not saying it was the wrong decision, but she did it out of her own\\nmotives. She never asked the child if she wanted to keep her baby. She told her she was giving it up for adoption. She said, \"Because I have a baby by this guy, and it\\'s going to be too weird. What, I\\'m raising my grandbaby who\\'s a sibling to my son? That\\'s not going to happen.\" So, this twelve year old, tears streaming down her face, not even understanding what\\'s happening to her. She had depression, she was raped by her mother\\'s boyfriend. And her mother, instead of trying to help her own daughter get through it, was there trying to get her daughter to say something that would allow the boyfriend not to go to prison. It, it and then, there were so many examples of that. I can\\'t even begin to tell you. Speaker 1: Yeah, that\\'s unfathomable, you know. You\\'d think she--what would he have to do for her if they want to get rid of him? I mean, I don\\'t know, I think, you would think that\\'d be enough, right? Speaker 2: What, for the girl--oh, yeah, for the boyfriend (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) yeah (unclear). Speaker 2: Yeah. I think, you know-- Speaker 1: What could he do? Speaker 2: There are so many women who are so insecure that they would have rather settled for any piece of man than to be by themselves. You know, the one thing I learned growing up with my mother [Sylvia Banks Kendrick] is she said, \"There\\'s a difference between being alone and being lonely.\" She said, \"Now, if I\\'m going to struggle, I\\'d rather struggle by myself,\" you know. And so many women would just rather say they have a man, even if it\\'s somebody that abuses their kids or mistreats them. It\\'s a phenomenon I still can\\'t ever get used to.',\n",
       "  'firm. And Nationwide Children\\'s, one of my friends was on the board and Nationwide Children\\'s asked me to come and talk to them. And they wanted to create a one stop child abuse center because they had children who were sexually abused, spending hours in the emergency room, sometimes eight, ten, twelve hours waiting on detectives to get there, waiting on children\\'s services to get there. So, they basically said, \"This is kind of what we\\'re thinking, but we\\'d like you with your experience to come in and design it.\" And so, I literally got the opportunity to plan, program, and build a center from the ground up. They had originally told me I had $3 million. I, I ultimately got $10 million, and we built a forty-two \\nhousand square foot facility that, now in Franklin County [Ohio], we\\'ve been open now for, since 2005 for seven years. So, we have literally changed the paradigm on how you treat abused children. What we did is we moved all of the systems that deal with seriously abused children into one location. This beautiful building looks like you\\'re walking into somebody\\'s living room. It doesn\\'t look like a hospital. It doesn\\'t look institutional. We moved our five child abuse physicians, nurse practitioners, eight trauma treatment therapists, seventeen detectives from our special victims bureau at the Columbus police department [Columbus Division of Police], ten children services investigators, two Franklin County prosecutors, a domestic violence therapist, a child psychiatrist, and the Columbus Coalition Against Family Violence [The Center for Family Safety and Healing, Columbus, Ohio] all in one location, all working together. It took us two years just to get the memorandums of understanding completed. But what--it\\'s amazing what happens when you take six organizations that are used to pointing the finger at each other, which is what they used to do when I was on the bench; the police would blame children\\'s services. Children\\'s services would blame the prosecutor as to why nothing happened. But now, instead of being this anonymous name on a phone message, it\\'s the person you see in the parking lot. It\\'s the person you get coffee with in the morning. So, the beauty of this is that when a child is raped, they come to the center, and everybody they need to see is at the center: the detective\\'s there, the children\\'s services worker is here, the physician is there. We immediately get them into trauma treatment with a therapist. And so, oftentimes, the police detective is able to go and interview the alleged perpetrator before the mom can get home and say, oh, my god, this is what they found. So, it\\'s a wonderful system. It was the work of my life. It\\'s what I thought I was going to end my career doing. And then, Governor Strickland [Ted Strickland] called in 2010 (laughter). Speaker 1: Yeah. For the record, the name of the place is the Center for Child and Family Advocacy [The Center for Family Safety and Healing, Columbus, Ohio]-- Speaker 2: At Nationwide Children\\'s-- Speaker 1: --at Nationwide Children\\'s Hospital. Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: And this makes so much sense. Is this still going on? Speaker 2: It is. Speaker 1: And has it been replicated in others? Speaker 2: Yeah, we, and we actually weren\\'t the first people to come up with this concept. I mean, there are centers like this that exist. Chicago [Illinois] has one. I went to visit the Chicago one. It\\'s twenty-seven thousand square feet. That\\'s when I knew I had to make it bigger. And Chicago\\'s is a house, it\\'s really kind of whimsical. They have windows that are on the floor, and they have windows that go up outside down, so it\\'s really entertaining for a child to look at. But one of the things I--when I met with the director there, and I asked her, I said, \"What would you do if you were doing different--doing it today differently?\" She said, \"I\\'d build it bigger.\" Because what we, what we everybody underestimated, which we got the benefit of their experience, is that when you create a safe place for people to come, where they don\\'t have to go down to the police station, where they don\\'t have to into a hospital emergency room, it makes it easier for people to come forward. So, I went to San Diego [California], I went to Chicago, I sent a consultant to Denver [Colorado], I went to Cincinnati [Ohio]. I went to Houston [Texas]. Houston has a fifty-six thousand square foot facility, and they were adding on to it at the time I visited them in 2002. So, we didn\\'t create the model. I\\'d like to say that ours is the most comprehensive model because we included domestic violence because what we found in interviewing our families is that 60 percent of our parents gave a current or prior history of domestic violence, so we believed in terms of healing the child, we had to heal the family. Speaker 1: Okay.',\n",
       "  \"memory? Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory. (Pause) My earliest childhood--never really thought about that before. I think, the thing I remember probably most vividly as a child, I had this, I loved to read. It's hard for people to realize that I was a painfully shy kid growing up. I wore--I had the cat eye glasses. And I was a little chubby kid, so I would always read. And I can remember at our house, we lived in, early on, when I was about five or six, we lived on this--it was like a house, but the, there were two apartments, and we lived on the upstairs apartment. And my mother [Sylvia Banks Kendrick] used to fix us mayonnaise sandwiches. We never, never knew meat was supposed to go in them, right? You put mayonnaise on the bread, little bit of sugar, and that was your sandwich (laughter). And so I would always sit and read, even at five or six years old. I just loved it. I, I didn't go outside like the normal kids. And one time, a friend of mine, some kid in the neighborhood, we were walking to the carry out, Dimler's carry out [ph.] at Fairwood [Avenue] and--Fairwood and Livingston [Avenue]. And as we walked behind the alley, and now this--I'm a sheltered kid, didn't go out much, was always an introvert--and I remember this old drunk man exposing himself to us, and being terrified. And, you know, we just ran all the way home. And I don't know if that had an impact on how, how much work I give now. I'd actually never thought about it before now, how much attention I give to kids and abuse issues. But I'll never forget being so terrified of that person and, and never really walking, feeling safe to walk to the store again. That would probably be the earliest memory, and the mayonnaise sandwiches. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, we always ask this question. Now, so did you grow up near Livingston you were saying? Speaker 2: I did, when we were young, I grew up at Fairwood and Livingston. I went, Fairwood Elementary [Fairwood Elementary School; Fairwood Alternative Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio] is where I went to kindergarten, and we had an apartment there. And that's probably where I spent--until I was nine years old that was the community we lived in. And then, when my mother married John Porter [ph.], we moved up to the Brittany Hills area [Columbus, Ohio], where Ohio Dominican College [Ohio Dominican University] is. Speaker 1: Okay. Now, now is that a move up in the neighborhood or? Speaker 2: It was, we got a house. John, she married John, and he bought a house so, you know, it was probably about a thousand square foot house and three bedrooms, no air conditioning, but it was a house. We had a basement. We had a backyard. We really thought we were moving up. I actually thought we were middle class until I got to college [Ohio University, Athens, Ohio], and they told me I was underprivileged so (laughter). But, you know, I, I want to go back to that. I don't want that childhood memory to be at that pedophile. I should think of something happy of a childhood memory 'cause that's a bad one, but it's odd--\",\n",

So those are--and they try to put that under the banner of religion and their laws. And in my opinion, I believe that our faith should be guided by love and not laws; and when that love is there, how do you for any--how does one for any reason kill their fellow human being because they feel they have disobeyed some law? So those are all things that, according to their beliefs, they say that they have to do, but there are things that are so wrong where the woman doesn't have a say, where she is blamed for everything. And these are issues that have to be addressed because she's at such a disadvantage. A young child barely--a young female child, barely a teenager, maybe ten, maybe nine [years old], is married off and expected to give birth at that tender age once she's able to give birth; and of course that leads to all sorts of health problems. So, those are things that have to be addressed--childhood marriages that don't allow the young girl to live her life as a child. And usually, when she gets married and she gets pregnant, and during labor develops complications and develops what we call vesicovaginal fistula, she is now abandoned by the man who now takes another young girl, so their lives are just totally ruined.

She's not broken and she never was, that is a miracle, because every woman in my family I've ever known was broken and had to put themselves back together.

I mean, the, the brutality of young people, the sense of hopelessness that leads them to just snuff out a life without a thought is horrifying to me. It is again I've just come across this theory that talks about wicked problems and I think this is a wicked problem that has at its root many different things. The lack of an education system, the changes in community, the profound failure of public education despite millions and millions of dollars from the private sector, from corporations, from foundations on an annual basis and it doesn't seem to get any better. So I am really very deeply troubled about the sense of possibility that--before our children. Their own sense of that possibility and how we see the world and what's going to be possible for them and especially as we move more and more into a globalized reality. You know, I heard a shocking statistic from a futurist who said that somewhere by the year 2025 something like 500 million men will live and die, never having had employment. That scares m\\n to death. What do young boys do when they have no gainful meaningful place to direct their energies? So that's one of the things that I anguish deeply about. What can we do, how do we focus on that. At the same time I am deeply committed to advancing the position of women and girls in our society. I mean, the, the, the activities in Africa right now, the war practices that use women as the fodder for this, is abhorrent and so frightening to me that a culture or cultures that so revered family and community and elders and ancestors could do this to women, to children. You know, the Congo is just one example. What's happening in Guinea today and 2009 scares me to death and so that's the other thing that I would love to figure out how all of what I've done before can make a larger voice for that as we go forward. I'm very, very scared about--I wish I could be more hopeful but I'm very scared that, you know, we've got to come to some cataclysmic event before people will wake up and the fact that we're not standing up outraged about this and screaming about this every day. That our boys are being killed walking to school that women are being raped and beaten and abused in this way. That to me is something that has to change\",\n",

One of my best girlfriends went away to school and we had known each other since I was twelve years old. She went to Southern Illinois--Southern Louisiana University [sic. Southern University at Shreveport] in Shreveport, Louisiana. And so I took my second flight ever in my life down to Shreveport, Louisiana. And there--now I\\'ve gone through some black experiences, [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis is my icon. I go down to the South in the \\'60s [1960s] with an Afro, short pants, tight t-shirt with the peace sign, in a place that still---where people if you were black, had to dress up with some form of docili- being docile and with servility if you were going downtown. You had to be in your Sunday dress. But I didn\\'t do that. In going to the stores, women would tell me, the white women would say, you know, \"Baby, you aren\\'t from here, are you?\" Because I wasn\\'t saying, \"Yes ma\\'am.\" I wasn\\'t giving them the proper southern props. And my best friend\\'s grandmother lived way in the country. And she lived in the outback with the outhouse. And I decided one day being the adventurous Marcia [HistoryMaker Reverend Marcia Dyson], to take a bike ride on the country road. And on that country road looking at the trees and glistening, I went and stopped at a little country store, just like out of Spanky [George \"Spanky\" McFarland] and \\'Our Gang,\\' the ragged screen fence, the little store and the eggs on ice and a little boy, black boy with a striped t-shirt was buying six eggs. Not even in a crate, just had six eggs, holding them and put them on the counter. And was looking in his pocket and threw the money on--put the money--was gonna put the money on the counter. And I told the little boy, \"Boy if you giving the man your money, you can look the man in his eyes.\" And the little boy looked at me kind of head cocked like I was crazy. He threw that money on the counter, grabbed those eggs, put them whatever cloth, maybe his mother--and ran out the store. And again, this man in the store said like, \"Girl, you must not be from here.\" I was like, \"No, I\\'m not from here, I\\'m from Chicago [Illinois].\" Now forget Emmett Till, forget--and I\\'m this big, black girl with the black experiences. I have seen some things, I have seen Fred Hampton killed. I know about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and all this shuffling Negroes. This is not me, I\\'m this tough girl from the North. I am from Chicago. But I started riding that bike back home, back, bike back to her, her grandmother\\'s house. And on the way there, a car full of rednecks came behind me. Then they were beside me. And they were saying things to me that when I saw that sun glistening on the trees, I thought my mother [Rosa Fields Smith] would never see me again because they were gonna take me into those woods and I\\'m sure rape me. A school bus came with white children. And I pedaled that bus [sic.] to keep up with the school bus and cross that bus in front of it perilously, rather be hit than be snatched in the woods by those white men. And the fear of every black person that I had seen in the movies, that trepidation, that southern fear, took hold of me and let me realize that like they said about Malcolm X compared to Martin Luther King, I saw the South on a soapbox, they saw it from the struggle. And it was my comeuppance. I started respecting the struggle more, the southern experience more. I understood the fear because it was in me. And it humbled me, you know, a great deal.

It was just a horrible situation. But if that wasn\\'t bad enough, once they get into becoming wards of the state, they were once again in some cases sexually abused and misused and some kids were being sent to five and six and twenty different homes and each home they went to, it was worse than the other, they was further being, they were sexually abused at home with their biological parents and now there\\'s these foster families. They were being sexually abused and there were other siblings there, other children there, that is not of the same family and each is sexually abusing each other and it was just a horrible, horrible situation and it was making me sick. I looked at the system and I said to myself, \"Something is wrong here.\" There was no continuity. There was no way that families were really getting back together, there was no closure in what happened to the child. We were raising children to become greater predators.

And don\\'t--I mean, we couldn\\'t even talk to each other. That was the rule, just, you know--but you know what, I think it\\'s amazing now when I look back and reflect on the discipline that we had and how effective it was for one teacher to teach that many kids. But I also remember Ms. Packer had a little strap. It was a leather strap. It was about that wide and about that long, and I never saw her use it but it was on the front of her desk and that was kind of like, you know, \\'cause you could get a whooping if you did bad things (laughter) back then',\n",
       "  'Speaker 2: And Ms. Packer, she dealt with fifty children?',\n",
       "  'So, my mother is the fourth of five children in what was a family that was very observant to Latter-day Saints, although maybe not so much my grandfather. He was mostly just religious about his golf. She went off to Brigham Young University [Provo, Utah]. In 1964, she graduated, having written newspaper articles about Mormon womanhood, ran off to Las Vegas [Nevada] with her boyfriend at the time, (whispers) had sex--one night and so woke up and got married the next morning in Las Vegas in an orange mohair dress at the Hitching Post Chapel (laughter) and that was my sister\\'s father, so she married him, she lived, had my sister [Elizabeth], lived for a few years, and then suffered through first the divorce with him, and then eventually from his suicide after they divorced, found herself a single parent with really no place in the church that had such traditional roles for women and so she went through the highly radicalizing experience of going to graduate school, went to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] in sociology, studied criminology, but especially women in the criminal justice system, wrote a master\\'s thesis about women\\'s sex workers and the experience that these women were having and the ways in which they were being exploited and also girls and women in the criminal justice system and the ways in which they were being often incarcerated for what were called \"status offenses.\" So, a girl would be raped by her stepfather and she would run away because she had been sexually assaulted and then she would be put into juvenile detention because of a status offense of being a runaway. In',\n",
       "  'Speaker 2: So, I was in college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and doing all this activism, and, or what I understand to be activism, campus protests, you know, kind of campus as a laboratory, all of that is around race. We are identified, in fact, we threw campus Kwanzaa every year, we saw ourselves as bringing racial presence to the campus. I did, I did almost nothing with women\\'s organizing on campus. Now, I took women\\'s studies classes, I read bell hooks, but I, in my actual work I did almost nothing around womens\\'--unless it was black womens--work with an emphasis, probably, on the racial aspect of it. It was really in graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina] when I started to identify with two important things; one, that I was a rape survivor which, although it occurred before I ever even left to go to college, I\\'m really rare--I don\\'t know that I ever really talked about it in college. I certainly hadn\\'t even disclosed it to my own parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] until senior year, maybe even, either senior year of college or first year of graduate school before I even disclosed that it had happened, even though it happened when I was fourteen. I just did not talk about it with any--when I was 14, I told one person, a friend, and no one else until I was about 20. And so, as I started engaging both my own kind of personal healing around it, started to disclose it, started to think of it as part of my identity as being a sexual assault survivor, that draws you into doing women\\'s work in a different way and I also started reading a lot of work by African American women who were rape survivors and, of course, almost all of us are survivors of rape at the hands of men who are black, because everyone is most likely to be sexually assaulted within the context of their own race. It\\'s not that men are most, that black men are most likely to be rapists, but they are most likely to be the rapists of black women, just as white men are most likely to be the rapists of white women. The--\"We must save the endangered black man, we must rally all together, our unity is more important than anything else\"--starts to fall apart when you are willing to be very honest about the amount of intra-racial gender violence, and it was something that even though I had experienced it, I just hadn\\'t dealt with it or thought about it, or theorized about it, or put it in the context of my work, and once I started doing that, it forced me to say, \"Okay, how do I love the race? How do I talk about this notion of black masculinity and black manhood, but have a place to talk about what happened to me at the hands of a black man.\" And, the more that I did that and the more that I started, you know, you start just following, I try to get my students to read this way--you read one thing and that person mentions something and then you can read that person since you are kind of, you know, doing this intellectual history just through reading what the people that you\\'re reading are reading--and when I started to\\ndo that, all of a sudden I realized, Oh, my God! Every time people would say, I could remember conversations in college where we would say how bad slavery was, in part because black women were raped, and if black women were raped that meant black men could not protect their women. I could remember these conversations as though the main victim of rape is the man, whose manhood is somehow damaged by this. I can remember us saying in Kwanzaa, like, \"We must protect the black woman who is our community\\'s greatest resource.\" Ahhh--she is the community, like, push her over as the resource in part, because black sororities and fraternities come out of an era of uplift. There is also a lot of weird, like gendered stuff that goes on about being \"the backbone,\" so even though Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] is this black woman\\'s organization, also sometimes reproduces a respectability politics that still has a relatively constrained notion for who black women are, and so you learn those things as mantras that you repeat because you\\'re proud of the organization, and it wasn\\'t until I start reading some of the critiques that I was like, \"Oh, yeah, woah. That is a problem.\" So it really, it was this kind of personal moment of changing my identity from, like pan-Africanist, nationalist, black girl, to pan-African nationalist black girl rape survivor, to \"Oh-wait a minute, that is going to have to change my whole analysis,\" and so by the time, and, I\\'m also by the way encountered Wahneema Lubiano, who made me read a whole bunch of other things and also just made me stop saying certain kinds of things and I met my very best girlfriend [Blair Kelley], who is the second half of my brain and she has never been anybody\\'s nationalist nothing, and so she critiqued and she challenged. She is a historian, actually a dean at North Carolina State [University in Raleigh, North Carolina] right now, so, as a historian she would push back against some of the kind of ahistorical, racial things I would say and so some of it was my identity, some of it was my friendship, some of it was what I was reading, but, you know, by the time five years of graduate school passed, I had a very, very different world view. Story_ID: 564909 Speaker 1: So I want to go back, you mention that you are a rape survivor and you didn\\'t tell your parents [William M. Harris, Sr. and Diana Gray] for a long time. Speaker 2: I don\\'t, still never told my father. I mean, he watches the show so I guess he knows, but I never said it to my father, yeah. Speaker 1: Did your family know this person? Speaker 2: He was our neighbor, which is why I did not tell, so this was after we had moved and my mother had gone through a lot to buy the home, so this is the first time we lived in a single family home. It was the first home that she herself had purchased and bought, and the fact we built it. Not a fancy house, just very basic, but it was the home that she built. A nice little, you know, neighborhood, still two, my two best friends in high school [Thomas Dale High School in Chester, Virginia] lived in that same neighborhood. This man, his backyard, so we were a corner lot, his backyard abutted ours, and he was a father, African American man, married, was a father of two children and lived there all through my high school, (not my, he wasn\\'t there in high school) high school years, college years. I finally told, I might be getting this timing a little wrong, I think I told junior or senior year of college [Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. I told my mom and then, and it was because she kept bugging me. Some mail for him had come to our house and she kept asking me, I was home on summer or Christmas break, and she kept asking me to take it over to him and I wouldn\\'t and I\\'m not, I mean, I\\'m rebellious but I\\'m not disobedient like that and she could not under--and finally, she was like, \"Take the mail over!\" and I spilled why I wouldn\\'t. Of course, at that point, so much time had passed no one at that point was talking and we just didn\\'t do anything legal, but then, and this now, I\\'m sure I\\'ve got the timing right on this. This, the second year of graduate school [Duke University in Durham, North Carolina], and this is hard to believe but he actually hit me in the face. He was walking. In certain ways this galls me even more because, like, all right, but I was standing in my front yard, it was Christmas, I was coming home. He was walking his dog past our front yard. The dog comes into the yard to use the bathroom, which I just saw as --- and so I screamed at him to get his dog off my yard because--Jesus!-- and then he screamed back, came into the yard, we got into each other\\'s face, and he hit me. So I called the police for that! Right? End up in court and telling the judge who this person is to me, what he had done to me, and the judge, (unclear) judge says, \"well, I mean, I don\\'t know anything about that, if there is any report of anything like that; this just sounds like neighbors and so go home and be nice to each other.\" And, basically you know my mom\\'s enjoyment of that neighborhood ended from the time that she knew, so she had enjoyed and loved her neighborhood, she is a gardener, she always loved to garden, but like her garden was the line of their property and so it really, so, part of the reason I never told was because sure enough, once I did and once that happened, it just made the whole experience for everyone there very, very ugly and awful, and it wasn\\'t long after that, after the court thing happened, because even though the judge did nothing, his wife heard me say what I said and people who rape teenagers, grown men who do that, are not single-time perpetrators. It\\'s never true, and I suspect that as the wife she also understood that he had probably perpetrated in other circumstances, whatever those were, because very shortly thereafter their marriage broke up and the family moved, but yeah, and again, I talk about being a survivor on air, but I have never had a conversation with my father about it.',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 1: So I would like to begin with your family history. Would you please tell me your mother's name and where and when she was born and tell me about her, please.\",\n",
       "  'Speaker 1: When you describe your evolving ideo--thinking. You mention [HM] Maulana Karenga who, at that time, was huge. Kwanzaa was very, very big. Can you describe your evolution in concept from Nia and in alignment with Karenga, too, your thinking when you got to \"Barbershop, Bibles, and BET?\"',\n",
       "  'Speaker 1: And I\\'d probably say the most thing--the thing I remember most was we had these retreats that were mandatory and I went on something called the Kairos retreat which is a special retreat in your junior year. And that was one of those times that was like you know when I think about sort of like that water shed moment of how like you\\'re in high school and you\\'re like going through all the dorky, awkward high school stuff, like it all came together for me after that retreat. And there were all sorts of things that they did to us during that time, very psychological but very effective. Like one part of the retreat was a night where they had all of your parents write a letter to you of every kid and then they read the letters out loud. And it was like, you know, everything you could possibly imagine you know from parents saying you know I know my alcoholism has been a problem to parents saying you know things, you know my sickness or whatever it is, things that you necessarily didn\\'t know about your friends, and just you know every child in the room was undone. I mean it was like you were a puddle. You just couldn\\'t even--and it just sort of gave you such an appreciation for all the issues that people around you were confronting that you really didn\\'t understand because you only saw them a certain way, a certain part of their life, a certain part of their day. And the other thing that they did was then everyone who had ever gone through the retreat, they had write you letters. So you\\'d go back to your room that night and they had a big huge envelope on your bed and your bed was filled with letters of people who knew you who had written to you from high school and your teachers. And it was one of those moments where the whole headline that they gave us during that period was you know they said that most kids are really insecure and you know doubting of themselves and lacking confidence. And the line from the retreat was \"I\\'m loveable because God doesn\\'t make junk.\" And we had these buttons that we wore. And you know in hindsight it sounds really hokey but it wasn\\'t. And so then when you sat down with these letters where people like basically poured out their heart to you and told you why you were so special to them, it was like you know it was beyond touching, beyond you know anything I ever imagined. And then when we came home, we\\'d been gone for two days and they, you know you\\'re just, you\\'re worn out emotionally. And they--one thing I should also say, they had each teacher get up and give a talk about their life and other students did the same thing. And their talk would end and begin with a song and then it would, they would tell you things that you just, no teacher had ever told you before about, you know things that had happened to them or what have you. And you know from one teacher telling us how her sister was raped and killed you know all sorts of things. So again it\\'s just emotionally, emotionally draining. And basically them trying to prove to us, life is just hard. There are things that are beyond your control. You got to pick yourself up. You\\'re a good person. You have to strive to continue to be a good person, that sort of thing, that kind of message. We come home and they say you know we got to pick up all of your stuff in the library. The library at Ignatius is at the top of the building. You walk into the room and they had the music playing from someone\\'s lecture and your entire family there to pick you up. It\\'s like you know, and you walk in and they\\'re all just clapping for you cause they know you\\'d gone through this like really emotional experience and so then everyone starts crying. I mean just like, it\\'s just this you know well of tears, buckets, buckets, buckets, and just amazing. And then to do that in high school, that\\'s a very significant memory that I have from Ignatius, significantly--significant.',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: [Saint] Ignatius [College Prep, Chicago, Illinois] had a lot of--they would throw us--the Jesuits are known for being sort of the politically incorrect priests, order of priests within the Catholic faith. And they would throw us these like misses, these like mind benders and then they would make us figure them out. And they would have us challenge each other in class and they'd have them all the time. I mean like all--this one I remember till this day, my religion teacher he said a woman, she's seventeen years old, she's walking down the street. She's abducted. No, I'm sorry. A woman, she's seventeen years old, she has mental problems. She's put in a mental institution, she's raped. Does she keep the child or do they abort the child. So we all sit there and we say they abort the child, there's no question about it. And he looks at us and he says you just killed me. And we were like, oh my god. And so any kind of like, where things weren't so clear, they would try to make us push ourselves harder to think about sort of repercussions of our views, so that we could think responsibly. Like they were giving us information but they wanted us to think responsibly about that information. So race, lots of discussions, lots of discussions around really controversial themes in the Catholic faith, euthanasia to abortion, to--and they which I really respect, it was like my upbringing at home even though on certain issues I told you my mother [Dorothy Brown] was absolutely non-negotiable around values.\",\n",

You can hit innocent--but more importantly, this man didn't do anything. And you're looking for a rape victim, what was he going to shoot you with his penis? Like I'm, I'm livid. Thirty bullets, you reload and I'm going 0-- Speaker 2: It was actually forty one, yeah. Speaker 1: But thirty--nineteen hit him. No, there was another one after that. But I think there--that was thirty shots cause I remember that, that was Diallo. After him was Dorsman [ph.], that was forty one. And then it was Sean Bell. There have been a series of these, unfortunately. But the first one was Amadou Diallo, and that came through and we sat in that meeting.\",\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: A person, I separate the person from the crime, and I tell jurors to do that. This person is a human being and they are afforded the dignity of a human being. The crime can be the most heinous thing in the world. I've had hate crimes where people have killed, you know multiple people. I've had people, I've seen maybe as a prosecutor or even as a judge, where people have done rape and murder and, and various other things and children are involved. But you still separate the crime from the person. And you're not here to judge the person, you're here to judge the crime. And that's what I try to impress upon the jurors. Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Speaker 2: And that's what I mean by that. Story_ID: 1316 Speaker 1: All right, all right. Let's see, well with what would have been some of the, I guess the memorable cases that have come before you as a Superior Court Judge? Can you talk about those? Speaker 2: Well a lot of mine, cause they were murder cases, they are on appeal. One case that is not on appeal is a homicide case that I can talk about. Is--it's kind of unfortunate. These two childhood friends and they grew up and went different paths during the dot com time. And the victim was making a lot of money setting up cubicles for all the dot com businesses and so forth, great deal of money. And he and his girlfriend got a little trendy little place, re-gentrified area and they were giving a lot of parties and probably had some drugs there and so forth. And so I guess he went back to his old childhood friend to get the drugs. And I guess the childhood friend saw a lot of cash being thrown around. And here the defendant and another assailant break into the house and rape and sodomize the girlfriend in front of the victim, she's a victim as well. Throws her into the closet naked and then she opens the closet door and saw the defendant put the gun to the guy--to his childhood friend's head and shoot him, and blow off his head. Then turned, opened the closet and shoots her in her stomach, where she's running and she survived. She runs out, and I hope I'm not getting to graphic, where she could see her intestines and everything hanging out. And what was so sad about--well everything was sad about the case. But sitting there in the courtroom watching family members from both sides, the victim and the defendant, and these people were next door neighbors. And they remember their sons being in Cub Scout together. That's very painful, that's very painful.\",\n",
       "  \", I've been involved in some of the most heinous murder cases and stood next to some of the most--people accused of the heinous crimes as a prosecutor. But you still treat them with dignity and respect. Everybody in my courtroom is addressed by their last names. Everyone will be given an opportunity to be heard, and I'll make my decision based on the law. And it's just great. Speaker 1: Now who, now who was convicted that would be considered a heinous, you know--\",\n",
       "  'was just, you know, a minor thing. In the, in the Catholic Church, I think that they were very concerned that I was a, a liberal, you know, bra burning woman or something. They just didn\\'t know. And I had done that study on the needs of women and girls and had talked about issues that I was called on the carpet for talking about by the head of the United Way [United Way of America; United Way Worldwide], you know, at the time. So, I was this person coming from Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island], didn\\'t--not understanding. And I wrote about--when I wrote about the needs, I talked about teen pregnancy, domestic violence, and rape. And I can remember the, the, the person who was killed in the car accident calling me into his office and he had my paper and he said, \"You\\'ve gotta take these words out of this paper.\" And I\\'m like, \"What words?\" And he said, \"Those words.\" And he had circled, you know, like sexually active and--\\'cause it was at a time when that\\'s what--that--you know, even then, and by then it was \\'81 [1981], you didn\\'t talk about it. You know, domestic violence was something that everybody knew was going on but nobody talked about, you know. And so it\\'s interesting because United Way then got in a lot of trouble as a result, you know. Because that same person put down this group that started up called wom- called Women\\'s Way [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and put them down in a negative way and it just blew up in the community because of that conservative streak, you know, well intentioned but, you know, it\\'s like women don\\'t know, you know, what they\\'re doing, so--and we don\\'t talk about it. So, the, the, the Catholic church knew that part of the story, you know. Actually, the person who was killed had said that--Women\\'s Way wanted to become part of the United Way and they got rejected, and this person told them that it was rejected because the Catholic church wouldn\\'t stand for it \\'cause they deal with things like abortion and rape crisis things and all of that. So, of course, me coming in having done the study saying we need to be doing more about it, you know, created a concern, you know, on the part--but, you know, I was told--when I got the job, I was told where the pressure points were and I worked on them and developed a excellent relationship with the, the Catholic community and the Jewish community and labor community. But, I knew I had to work on it. So, they gave me a gift of saying that we don\\'t know if we want you in this job, you know, \\'cause then you could work on it--work on it a different way.',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 1: Yeah, there's an attack on juvenile--the juvenile justice system is the other one where people think that the kid--not only are the parents of the kids the enemy, but the kids are no darn good, you know, as far as people are concerned. And that's really--the kids in the juvenile justice system, I'm gonna tell you a story about the juvenile justice system and the link to the child welfare system. So, a young woman--and this is a young story that's not about a particular girl but it could be about lots of girls in the child welfare system and in the juvenile justice system. So, most of the children who are physically or sexually abused are abused by some man that they know, you know, the mother's boyfriend, the uncle, the cousin, whatever. So, a, a girl is abused, sexually abused and is taken away, put into the child welfare system, put into a foster home, runs away from the foster home, wants to be home still, wants--you know, runs away from the foster home, runs away again, is put in another one, runs away again, ultimately ends up on the street. What do you think she does to keep herself alive? Speaker 2: Prostitution, yeah. Speaker 1: What she was taught, right? Speaker 2: Yeah. Speaker 1: So, when she's picked up for prostitution, no one ever looks back and says, how did this child really get here? What's the trauma in her life, you know? And, and she becomes one of those kids that everybody wants to look down on. Whose fault is it, you know? And so that's, to me, the number of kids that are in that situation in this country that we don't know about, we don't talk about, we don't care about is I think just outrageous. So, yeah, we gotta--we've gotta do something about it even though there's not enough money.\",\n",
       "  'Speaker 2: You know, it was at a time--the thing that we were trying to work on is at the time, they didn\\'t even keep police statistics by age. So they didn\\'t--when you don\\'t look at data to understand what\\'s going on--they didn\\'t understand that, that elderly people were victims of very specific crimes. So, we did a pilot starting--just looking at the data. Let\\'s collect the information by age and look and see. And we found out for an example that they were very, very, very vulnerable to what was called push in crimes, where they would go to their front doors and fumble a little bit with their keys trying to get in \\'cause they were older and somebody would come behind them, push them in, and rob them in the safety of and, and in the violation of their own homes, and then they would go. So, they were--so, we--but just by using data, we were able to figure out that there are certain crimes that the elderly are more prone to be victims of. And then we took that information--it just--where the applied part was also always important for me, we then took that information and started doing training with police departments. And it was at the same time when they were getting training around rape to try to sensitize them to the whole issue of rape, so we would generally go into these meetings where one person would be training on rape and I would be training around the elderly, and the bizarre kind of statements, \"Well, she brought it on herself, she had on this short dress.\" All in the, the mindset back then was so interesting, you know, where, where they really didn\\'t get it, you know. And it was right at that time when, you know, women\\'s rights and, you know, respect for women, and, and the elderly were in the mix \\'cause they didn\\'t even think enough to wanna collect the statistics by--and they never asked the age of the victim, you know.',\n",

To quit my job, get pregnant, and start a business, all at the same time. It was very difficult. It was kind of like that first week of skiing. It was very, very challenging. I was exhausted, I only had like twenty hours of babysitting, and was, you know, so starting a business was really slow. I quickly realized, most entrepreneurs were working sixty hours a week, you know. And I was working, maybe fifteen, you know, hours a week. And so things that would take an entrepreneur a week, it would take me a month. And so it was slow going, and it was exhausting, and I was a new mother, which we know is hard. Plus, I was starting to have a lot of the anxiety issues about the sexual abuse, and so it was hard getting started, but I wouldn't trade it for anything, because I was able, I had always--when I was in fourth grade, I was writing my first book ['Succeeding Sane: Making Room For Joy In A Crazy World,' Bonnie St. John]. I had always wanted to write books. And reading books had been my solace. I read books on the playground when other girls were playing double Dutch jump rope and hopscotch, and I couldn't do what they were doing, I would sit and read a book. And I would travel on adventure. I would be a superhero in the book 'cause I couldn't do it on the playground. And I would read a Nancy Drew book in one night. I would go in the bathroom and turn the light on and stay up and read a book, you know, at night. They were my escape venue. My, where I could dream, where I could be someone bigger or better. I could explore a mental world. And so I always wanted to write because books had given me so much. I wanted to do that. So getting to start my own business, get my first book contract with Simon and Schuster [Simon and Schuster, Inc.], write a book and then be at home, you know, in the afternoons and I could teach my daughter to swim in the pool and take her for walks in the park, and I was able to create a life for myself that I wanted.\",\n",

You know, he was a--he sexually abused my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I. I, again, these are things you don\\'t realize \\'til you\\'re older. So she was in Detroit [Michigan], a single mom with three kids, struggling to make ends meet. When she--I think she was still in school when my father [Lee St. John] first left and she had three babies and she was trying to finish her degree so she could be a teacher. She--the story she told me was that she was told by welfare that if she wanted welfare, she had to quit school. And I--those were the rules back then, I don\\'t know. And she didn\\'t want to, and the only reason, the only way she was able to stay in school was she got a loan from the Jewish Free Loan Society [JFLA]. So again she had, you know, because she had had the connections with the Jewish family, she was able to make this connection and get that help and stay in school, and finish and then get her teaching degree, and she started teaching in Detroit. So Paul Cremaschi came along and married her, and took her to San Diego. And when you think about that, she was, she was twenty-seven, he was sixty-seven when they got married. He was, he was preying on a vulnerable, poor black woman, far away from her family, with two young daughters. He married her and took her further away from anyone she had ever known, and was able to prey. He was able to prey on my sister and I for years without being caught, or stopped, or questioned, or anything. I believe now that this was, you know, something he did to probably hundreds of kids over the--his career, and he targeted us because we were vulnerable. And again, I think that\\'s gotta to be the story of so many young black girls. He was white, but he targeted a vulnerable, poor, single black mother with two daughters. Speaker 1: And did your mother ever know that this was happening? Speaker 2: The hundred thousand dollar question everyone asks. I used to say no. Because you don\\'t want to believe that. I think, probably the best way to say it is she had been so abused, she was fighting so many demons, she was sexually abused in her own childhood, and she never got healing from that. She struggled with so many demons about race, about that. She had seen lynchings when she was younger. She had a lot of difficult stuff going on in her head, and she tended to dissociate. So I remember telling her when I was eighteen that I was abused. And she basically said, \"Well, so was I. Get over it, move on.\" There was not a lot of warmth or sympathy about that. It was, \"Move on. I don\\'t really wanna hear it.\" And, and I think some of that is her guilt, right? She had guilt around it so she just, is like, and her own pain, right? It brings up all her own pain. So she dissociates separate. Years later when I wrote my first book, \\'Succeeding Sane\\' [\\'Succeeding Sane: Making Room For Joy In A Crazy World,\\' Bonnie St. John], that was the first time I mentioned in a book that I had been abused. And we were gonna go on \\'The Montel Williams Show,\\' and they called her up and said, \"We want you on the show.\" And you know, they were doing the pre-interview, and they asked her, \"When\\'s the first time you heard that she was abused?\" And she said, \"Well, this show.\" So she would continually forget. My sister tells a story that she was at an event, it was a community event with lots of people, and my sister said something about being abused. And my mother turned to her and said, \"You have abuse in your family?\" I mean, there was a dissociation that continuously went on. But the most painful thing for me, when I started doing my own healing work around this, and I started being willing to focus on it honestly, and process some of what had happened. There\\'s a story that my sister tells. I say it\\'s a story, you know, it\\'s, it\\'s true\\n She told my mother when she was nine or ten, that something--she got in trouble for doing something. And she said, \"This is because, this is what\\'s going on.\" She was doing something sexually inappropriate, and she said, \"This is why.\" And what she says is that mom said to her, \"Well, has it stopped? Is it not going on anymore? Okay, well then, forget about it.\" Basically, the same thing she said to me when I was eighteen, she said to April when she was nine. And I had heard that story, and I thought it was horrible. But I didn\\'t really process it, and it wasn\\'t until I was in my thirties, wasn\\'t until I was in my thirties that I did the math. If my sister was nine or ten, I was still being abused and nobody asked. Nobody checked. \\'Cause I was abused from the age of two to the age of seven. And so this question of, did my mother know, is complex. She had, she had issues. Story_ID: 521602 Speaker 1: How did it stop? Speaker 2: I went to therapy when my daughter [Darcy Deane] was young, and I had to. I had, what I had done, okay. I had literally forgotten about it. I had forgotten, erased the memories from the time that it happened until I was eighteen. And what happened when I was eighteen is my stepfather [Paul Cremaschi] died. And I\\'ve come to understand, if you read about it, that this is a common thing. That when the perpetrator dies, you feel safe enough to bring the memories back. And so, it\\'s the weirdest thing, because it\\'s not like one day you wake up and go, \"Ah. I was abused. Ah!\" You know, it\\'s like the best way I can explain of what it occurs, how it occurs in your brain is it\\'s like a path. Imagine that you live in a neighborhood and you walk around the neighborhood, and there\\'s this road, dirt road that kind of goes off. And you just haven\\'t walked down that path in a long time. You know it\\'s there, you know you were down there years ago, you know it\\'s there, you just never think about it. And so you walk past every day and you never go. And then all of a sudden, when you\\'re eighteen and you walk down that path, and you go, \"Oh, yeah. I always knew this was here, but I just never went.\" And so it doesn\\'t shock you. It doesn\\'t surprise you. You just realize, \"I remember this, and I haven\\'t remembered it for ten years.\" Anyway, it just, I know if people haven\\'t experience that, it\\'s just impossible to imagine. But at eighteen, I remembered that I was sexually abused. And I only remembered little snippets of it, but I talked to my mom [Ruby Page Schwimmer] about it. But it wasn\\'t until I had my own daughter that it started to become a real problem for me. So I just shut it down, I just, my mom said, \"Don\\'t think about it.\" I said, \"Okay.\" But once I had my own daughter, the pain started to bubble up in many ways, and I didn\\'t realize that that was what was happening at first. But things like, when she would come home after school, I would black out. Because that\\'s when I would be abused, is every day when I came home from school, and he was there and my mother was at work. And so there were, there were things--and I say blackout. Like, we\\'d be playing and I would just fall asleep. And I didn\\'t, this would repeatedly happen in the middle of the afternoon. And it\\'s, you know, it\\'s crazy stuff is happening, and the anxiety was coming up, and it took me a while to put together what it was. And that if I wanted to be a mother, I needed to treat it. And I think that\\'s one of the things when I look back, my mother never did the healing work. And that\\'s part of the reason why she missed all the signs and she couldn\\'t, you know, and I realized, if I don\\'t do my healing work, my daughter could be abused and I might fall asleep and miss it. (Laughter) You know? So I was motivated to do the work. And some people, you know, I am a strong person of faith. And I think for me, at that time, I was working on my prayer life a lot, and that gave me the strength to do the work. But I don\\'t believe, some people believe if you just forgive the past, and pray, you\\'re done. I had to do more than that. Maybe that works for some people, but I had to go to therapy, I went to a hypnotist that took me back, so that\\'s why I know that it ended when I was seven. I\\'m sorry, you asked me, \"How did it end?\" And I know this because I went into therapy and because I did the hypnosis. Gosh, this is hard. So he had been abusing me for years. He had been playing little sex games with me after school, when I would come home from school. And, and, especially when I was in kindergarten, you know, I\\'d get home earlier than my brothers and sisters. You know, he was able to have time alone with me. And I think one of the unwritten rules was that no one spoke. That you didn\\'t speak when these things, the unspeakable, right? Because nobody spoke. When I was seven, I said something and he immediately stopped his activities and left, and it never happened again. Okay, this is the really hard part. So in the hypnosis, I had to go back and relive some of these things. And it was very judicious about the healing. About--because what you\\'re trying to do is go back and unpack what happened, and what you learned to believe because of the things that happened. And you want to be able to undo that process of creating false beliefs about yourself and about the world. And, which would be things like you don\\'t matter, and you don\\'t have any value, and your value is only as to pleasure somebody else, you know? You have to undo all these beliefs. I felt like it was a process of, like the Greek myth, when Hercules goes back into Hades and goes in to save someone and pull them out. That I had to do these therapy sessions, to go back and find this child and bring them out of Hell. It was a very difficult period. Story_ID: 521603 Speaker 1: But reliving that memory of the last time he sexually abused me (crying), the most horrible part about it is that the child became very depressed. Because as a child, I was sad that the abuse stopped. Because it was a feeling of affection and warmth and love and it was, I don\\'t know, it was normal. It was what was there. And so I thought I had done something wrong. That was the third grade, and I got all Cs in third grade. I was always a straight A student through my whole life, and I remember I got all Cs in third grade. And I think, I never put it together, until much later, until I did this hypnosis and I understood. I became a very depressed child because I had done something wrong and I was being punished by my stepfather [Paul Cremaschi]. And, any sane adult human who looks at that and says, \"How can you twist a young child into somebody who would become depressed when it stops?\" It\\'s horrible (crying). Speaker 2: Did you find yourself angry with your mother [Ruby Page Schwimmer]? Speaker 1: Not until after she died. My mother was an amazing person. It\\'s so funny, given what I\\'ve shared with you. It\\'s gonna be hard to reconcile with that, with the fact that she was an educator. She was looking after everyone\\'s children. She was the principal of many schools, and she made a very positive difference in not only the lives of the students who were there, but the teachers and the parents. She died at age sixty-seven, and at her funeral, over three hundred people came and spent hours telling my brother [Wayne St. John] and my sister [April St. John Keenoy] and I what she had done for them. And how much she had done for them. That she had kept kids in school who, you know, gotten them off drugs and somebody said, \"She helped me find a husband.\" You know, or parents, \"She helped me get back in school.\" Or teachers, \"She helped my further degree.\" And, you know, she did so much for so many people. But when you look back, she was a very, you know, her life, her childhood was so horrible, she was fighting with demons. When I was growing up, she used to take us to motivational speakers, she used to spend hours writing affirmations. Writing positive statements over and over again. So what I learned from her was that her life was messy and painful, but she fought to try to stay more positive. She didn\\'t always win, but she fought for more positivity for herself, for her children, you know, even though, okay, she made this one really big mistake with marrying Paul Cremaschi, and not being able to see the signs. But she filled our house with books. She made us love education. She supported our interests, whether it was skiing or my brother\\'s photography. He built a--he\\'s a photographer now. He built, she bought him his first enlarger to develop pictures, at a pawn shop. You know, and helped him build a dark room in the garage, and she gave us so much. It\\'s--at her funeral, my brother\\'s speech, he said, \"She was the best of moms, and she was the worst of moms. But she was never in between.\" So I valued my relationship with her. When she turned sixty, I took her to England for a week, we spent a week in England together. Shortly before she died, I got to speak on a Disney cruise [Disney Cruise Line] and I took her with her. She loved, me with her, she loved Disney [The Walt Disney Company], and Roy Disney [Roy E. Disney] was on the ship. And Jennifer Hudson was singing on the ship, and it was an amazing trip. I loved my mother and I wanted that relationship. But after she died, I think I was willing, I was willing to admit more things to myself. And it\\'s like what I said about when my stepfather died. You\\'re willing to go down roads that you didn\\'t go down for many years. When my mother died, it felt like, you know if you took a beach ball, and you pushed it under the water, and then you took your hand away, it would shoot up? That\\'s what it felt like to me, is that there was all this stuff that had been pushed down for so long, and it shot up after she died, and I couldn\\'t stop it. So I was, I had a lot of anger after she died that I had to process. But I didn\\'t share that with her. Story_ID: 521604',\n",

       "  'So I leaned, and then I said, \"I don\\'t want nothing. I can do this on my own. I\\'m gonna look cool. I\\'m gonna be cool. I\\'m gonna be like everybody else,\" you know. And when I had my daughter [Darcy Deane], and then the pain of the sexual abuse started coming up, I couldn\\'t do it on my own anymore, and the pain was so intense. I was going through that process of going back over the memories, and doing the healing, and I was still a mom. And I would have to come back and be a mom, dry my tears, and come back and be a mom, or go and give a motivational speech for everybody. And because I had to hold it together for my daughter, sometimes when I would fly to another city to give a speech, that was when I could break down and cry, and just let the pain out. And I remember I was in a hotel room, and I was supposed to give a speech, and I was laying on the bed and just sobbing. And just--the pain was just coming over me so much, I couldn\\'t get off the bed. I couldn\\'t get up. And I remember, I just said, \"Help me, God.\" And it was like it lifted and I could get off the bed. And that was a moment for me that I thought, this is real. This isn\\'t talking to your invisible friend, God is real, and I want to know more about that. And so, having to go through that difficult healing process really brought me back to God and really helped me, inspired me to explore my relationship with prayer. And so it was because of that that I ended up writing the book, \\'How Strong Women Pray\\' [Bonnie St. John]. Because I developed my prayer life, I\\'d started to get more of a relationship with God.',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 1: And the story is that when my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Lee] got a job ironing shirts for forty dollars a week, she became independent. She didn't have to live in somebody else's house. This was a big step up for her, and she sent for her daughters to come and live with her in New York [New York]. Speaker 2: That's how they came. Speaker 1: And that's how they came to New York. So in elementary school, I think, at some point. But that was very difficult. Her husband--her boyfriends, I don't know if she remarried, were physically and sexually abusive of the girls. It was not a-- Speaker 2: Your grandmother's, your grandmother's? Speaker 1: My mother [Ruby Page Schwimmer] was sexually abused by her mother's boyfriend. And they--one of the things I have again about the insights I have on this is later in life, when my mother was in her sixties, she did a lot of writing. And my mother was an English teacher. So she joined writers groups and she wrote a little vignettes, and they were stories. And they were very difficult to read. There's a story about him pounding her head on the sidewalk and bleeding, and her running away and being in a bathtub with just blood all over her. And somebody throwing things and bottles at her head, you know. It's very difficult reading. And I'm sure, much more difficult to live. She had a very difficult childhood. So even when her mother was able to send for her, and reunite the family, you know, it wasn't an easy comfortable thing. At--I think at about thirteen, she ended up moving out and becoming a mother's helper for a Jewish family. And that had a huge influence on my mother. She later converted to Judaism when I was fifteen. So the influence she\\nhad from spending time as a teenager in the Jewish family, gave her a lot of the emphasis she had, on learning and education, and she loved what she absorbed from the Jewish culture.\",\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: My sister is a doctor in Lansing, Michigan. And my brother is--owns a photography business in Charlotte [North Carolina], and they're both doing very well. My sister is actually now working at a methadone clinic, so she's helping addicts get better. Which is wonderful 'cause my sister has struggled a lot over time with, I don't know, anxiety issues and a variety of things. She's struggled a lot, I mean we were both sexually abused as children, and so she struggled a lot with that. And so I think it's a wonderful place for her to be to help other people who are struggling. Again, it's this resilience theme, right?\",\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: So much of all of my family is a mystery to me. And so we can talk about it, but a lot of it's gossip, and gossip and rumors, and innuendo. Again, like so many black families. But she--her mother was Mary Lee, and her father was Arthur Page. And her father left before she was born. Her father--I, you know, this is one of those things again, mystery, shrouded. I think he got her mother pregnant when she was fourteen with her sister Rosalie, and then I think they had a shotgun marriage. Which again, in this day and age, would be statutory rape, you know. And now it, and then, but it was a shotgun marriage. And then, so, right after that, the next child came, Ruby, and he was from a family of sixteen kids. And so, again, one of the legends I've heard is that he saw the writing on the wall. We're gonna have a kid every year, I'm not sticking around for this. This is not what I want to do. And so he left before she was born. And her mother struggled, lived with my mother's grandmother, my great-grandmother, in Gainesville, Florida, and it was very hard. I remember vaguely later in life when we were living in San Diego. Maybe I was four or five, or six. He came to visit and tried to establish some connection with her, and she really didn't want to. She was angry, and I think, even then, she felt he was, wanted to use her and wasn't interested. So there was no connection with her father.\",\n",

And the largest verdict at that time in that county, I received, in a case where a man received approximately 233 years in prison, as a result of the case, so I vividly remember that case. There were several others, but that one was by far, because the verdict was so big, that, one that stands out in my mind.\",\n",

So, I wasn't very comfortable, in that environment, so I requested to go do all of my time, full-time, with the children, and it was during that time, I was counseling with children who had been sent to the state hospital, and we would go to court with them, as a social work intern.\",\n",

And I, and I actually have done a number of lectures on sexual harassment issues because I have won a couple of big cases, very high-profile cases for my clients. But I, but the issue of sexual harassment is one that has really grown in the last 10 or 12 years, in part because people now are recognizing that the kinds of things that women--and by the way, I mean now, men are actually filing lawsuits for sexual harassment. But this is primarily been an issue of, of women and a lack of power that women have in the workplace. And so what I do is we, I do sexual harassment training so that we spend a lot of time at our clients\\' offices teaching people from, literally, from the C.E.O. to the person that empties the trash, about sexual harassment, about the responsibilities of the company, that the companies have, encouraging people to come forward to make a complaint. The way that the law has been developing in the Supreme Court is that a company really has to have a program, a procedure whereby a person who feels that they\\'ve been sexually harassed can make a complaint. If you have that procedure and you have trained your staff and people know that the procedure is there, then a person can\\'t show up at the courthouse door a year later, two years later and say, \"Well, I knew about the procedure, but I was afraid.\" And so what we\\'re really doing is educating the public, that if you feel like you\\'ve been sexually harassed, you need to complain to your employer. You need to make them do an investigation. They should do a prompt investigation, and if they find that there is sexual harassment, they need to stop it or else that company is gonna be on the hook for paying big damages to their employees.

My grandfather at the age of around thirty was married to a woman her name was Mae [Williams]. They were not able to have children and my grandfather was at that point reasonably prosperous for a black Jamaican and Mae it turns out that it was Mae who could not have children because when my grandmother, Sarah [Lloyd] who was thirteen was sent from the country to work in their household, Sarah became pregnant by Jack. I am sure the scandal was significant although I will say in that era thirteen year olds were getting married, having babies all the above. But still scandalous, this is--I don\\'t, I\\'m sure they were not first cousins, they probably were like third or fourth cousins but it\\'s still unseemly and in today\\'s world it certainly would have been statutory rape. So my father was born to Jack Williams and Sarah Lloyd who when he was born she was fourteen years old. I found my father\\'s birth certificate, in fact, there are two birth certificates. The first birth certificate that reflects his original date of birth indicates that Mae was present at his birth. I went to the address where that\\'s listed on my father\\'s birth certificate at 9 Hannah Street in Hannah Town, Kingston [Jamaica] and we believe that\\'s where the midwife was. My grandmother, of course, was sent out of that house when she was pregnant and she probably lived with relatives in Kingston until the baby--my father was born. When he was born Mae took possession of him.',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: Oh sure. Well if I get to--when we did our--when we conducted our DNA search what it showed was on my father's [Elrick Williams] side he came from a tribe in northern Europe. Speaker 1: Now I just want to deal with your mother's [Nell Williams] side right now. Speaker 2: Right but I'm going to explain. So what you would see is that we couldn't zero in on my father's side anymore than to identify that my father, his DNA markers were from northern Europe. People would say oh my God that's interesting, like wow. That would have been the slave owner who would have raped the African slave who somewhere down the line was my ancestor. On my mother's side the Ocond people who are Ashant\\n. So the Ashanti are known for their warrior culture. The Ashanti are known for being fierce warriors. When those slaves were captured in what's today present day Ghana and were taken across the Atlantic and were taken to Jamaica in order to be broken in, the word they used was seasoned; they would season them. The slave owners would break their spirits and teach them how to be subservient or that was the goal, submissive. It didn't work so well in Jamaica. The Ashanti are actually the group that is the majority of the Jamaican population; more than 90% of Jamaicans are of Ocond or Ashanti descent. So you have a built in culture of warrior mentality; going to fight back. I am independent; you can't tell me what to do, which in many ways has played out even today in Jamaica.\",\n",

And I had thought about it because I loved biology and I thought about delivering babies. I thought that that would be the most noble thing to do, to bring children into the world. And there was one weekend that he actually set me up at D.C. [District of Columbia] General with one of his buddies, who's a doctor, who's an obstetrician. And we put our scrubs on and we did deliver babies together for a weekend. And it was actually kind of the most horrific experiences of childbirth, because you had a lot of people there, no prenatal care--very, very poor--emergency deliveries. Nothing was pretty. We had one woman who was obese and was a heroin addict and her baby was dead inside of her and had been inside of her for a while. But because she was a heroin addict, she hadn't naturally delivered. So, I was with this doctor, Dr. Lawer was his name. And we came in together with our scrubs, and I was just his little assistant. And she was there, and she was very angry, very upset. I think she might have still been high, and she was cursing at him because she was one of the only white people in the hospital because D.C. General mostly is predominantly black. So she was cursing at him, accusing him of, you know, undermining what was going on, you know, her baby and all that stuff. So it was really strange and disturbing to see. There was another young, young woman, a teenager. It was like her second or third child. Nobody was there with her. Nothing was happening on time, so she didn't have time for any medications. So she's screaming and crying and everything is just very traumatic. Another woman who came in had been raped. And so it was all these different types of deliveries and experiences within that weekend. And it did not discourage me at all. I loved it even more. I mean, I was not deterred by seeing all of that.

And it was so frightening, but nothing--like, the school never did anything. And I cannot think for the life of me why--I don't know if we told our parents or they didn't get how crazy it was, but we just went to school, and that was just part of, like, going to school there.

But because I was involved in the school newspaper, I did like shows, I would do these dance routines; I don't even remember what kind of shows I did. And I wrote for the yearbook, and so, I would be there after a lot of kids left, and then I would be afraid to leave the school. And, yeah, it was--it was frightening. But I cannot tell you why our parents never did anything about it. Why--or maybe they tried and there was nothing that could be done. But I know the police officers laughed at us.

A region because of this dense, thick, dense rain forest and was exploited by King Leopold [Leopold II of Belgium] in the most atrocious kind of way, you know, the kind of atrocities that he, he committed there. But out of that, you have this legacy of repression that\\'s continues to perpetuate itself. And even now you have a war that\\'s going on that has claimed 3 million people since 1997 and yet receives relatively little coverage. But the real victims of this war are the women and children who were pretty much helpless and who didn\\'t start this war, who don\\'t fight the war but find themselves bearing the brunt of it. And one of the things that I went to look at in the Congo are the kind of gender specific human rights abuses that women suffer. And what we\\'re seeing is that rape has become one of the primary tools of war used against both men and women but because rape is a tool, a tool of war, there are certain kind of medical problems that arise, a lot of the women end up gang raped and being \"ruined,\" which is going to be the title of my play. And once they\\'re ruined, they\\'re driven out from their villages and they\\'re forced to wander. So now you have this class of women who are homeless. And, and because you have these wandering women you lose a generation of mothers who are not raising sons, those sons get sucked back into the war so the cycle continues. And so I, I\\'ve been spending (laughter) a lot of time contemplating this and trying to figure out a way of dramatizing it but I don\\'t wanna dramatize it in the typical way, in which you, you its documentary style in which these women become talking heads. I wanna find a way of, of telling a universal story, much in the way that Bertolt Brecht did with \"Mother Courage.\" That\\'s accessible, that\\'s human, that has some humor (laughter) and that lives beyond the crisis.',\n",

They wanted to do a Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] celebration and they invited him to come and speak. And they were gonna do a short little march about you know maybe half a mile from one point to the courthouse and then he was gonna speak and, and talk to them about Martin Luther King. And so we got a bus and there were about sixteen to eighteen of us on the bus and we came--went to the King Center. My son was seven years old. He was with me. And my husband was in, in New York, not with us then. And we got on the bus and took off down the highway to Lake Lanier just about ten minutes but when we got to the exit for Lake Lanier, we saw this one white man waving his arms like go back, go back, go back. We said what is he doing? He was just was standing there waving no, no and the bus pulled off the exit anyway. And he said man y'all gotta\\ngo back. There's 300 Klansmen down there and four regalia and they are waiting for you all. The word got that y'all were gonna do this and you know the story of Forsyth County is that seventy-five years ago they had a white woman accuse a black man of raping her. They went through the town and packed up every--took people out of their houses, packed up every black person on the trucks and drove them to Alabama and dropped them off. I mean they left stoves burning, food cooking, they left all their belongings, they left everything. And there hadn't been a black person living in Forsyth County in seventy-five years. So that's the history of this place. But my father decided to go on. And so when we got further on down the road, we had to get off the bus and the bus had to shield us from the Klansmen that were throwing everything at us from manure to feces to urine, the bricks. They beat that--they broke every window in that luxury passenger bus with broom handles, with--I didn't hear any gunshots or anything like that and I saw little babies in Klan, that's the first time in a long time I'd seen like five years olds with the cap and the thing in the cross and everything. Just you know starch whites. So we had to get back on the bus and come back to Atlanta and in two weeks but it got on the news that people were beat. It got on the news that again here's Hosea Williams getting beat, blood being shed and the reaction causing a change in society. Here again he's playing that same role we talked about before and two weeks after that 35,000 people just swarmed on the city of Atlanta and we marched again. And we finished the march that day. So I, I just felt like I had stepped back in time. I couldn't believe this was still happening.\",\n",

And I encourage--you know, it's harder--and this is something I would like to say for the record for me, is it I think people not understand how much harder it is for black people to go before the law and the court, because we have not always felt we get justice in the courts. And that court is not an easy thing. I read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' [Harper Lee]. It makes white children feel good about Atticus Finch, well what about black people when this poor man is about to be murdered for raping someone he never raped. It's not a happy story, it's a tragic--I mean, I love the book, but it's tragic. And it's differently tragic for a black person. So I was scared when I went to court because I was not--all my white friends including at Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] were so shocked by Judge Pannell [Charles A. Pannell, Jr.]. I was not expecting him to be that ignorant and it was three white conservative men who freed my book; however, it did not shock me that he would feel the audacity to do this.

And then I finished my dissertation while I was living here in Chicago [Illinois]. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: So, but I moved here in 1991, and that was the moment that Clarence Thomas was being nominated for the [U.S.] Supreme Court. And I was involved in another national mobilization called African American Women in Defense of Ourselves, which really tried to add a different voice to the debate around Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. Anita Hill, of course, was the person that accused him of sexual harassment and almost derailed his appointment to the Supreme Court, and she was vilified as someone, you know, who was not trustworthy--she was making this up, she was trying to bring a black man down--and it was a very simplified formula because, of course, Clarence Thomas had, in many ways betrayed the interests of most black people long before Anita Hill\\'s accusations, which I think were quite credible, came to the fore. Speaker 1: What voices in the black media were putting this case together, that she was dragging down--? Speaker 2: I don\\'t remember all the names. I do remember Orlando Patterson from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] wrote a piece in The New York Times which was pretty troubling, describing his take on black male/female relations and framing this alleged sexual harassment in that context. And what his position was, was essentially that this was, that what Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of was a kind of flirtation that was common, and that she should have known that this was harmless flirtation, and not kind of outed him. So, you know, I can\\'t even muster the words to express the extent of my disagreement with that, but that was one pretty vile interpretation. But even people like [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, for example, supported Clarence Thomas initially, and said, \"Look, he comes from a poor black background and if he\\'s in there, if he\\'s in the Supreme Court, his experience as a black man growing up in the South under adverse circumstances, that has got to kick in at some point. That has to have an effect on his judgment.\" And certainly with all due respect to Maya Angelou, that has not proven to be the case. So, anyway, African American Women in Defense of Ourselves was a group of black women. We mobilized people to raise quite a lot of money in a short amount of time for a national newspaper ad campaign which was, it put an ad in The New York Times and a number of African American papers. We raised about fifty thousand dollars, which was a lot for us at the time. I realize it\\'s probably not now. And sixteen hundred women signed a statement that basically said we felt that black women\\'s voices were not being heard, that Anita Hill was being distorted, and it really was not about supporting Anita Hill in a sort of narrow sense as it was confronting all the misrepresentations of race and gender in the discussion around Clarence Thomas. And it was also indicting, you know, his conservative views as not being in the interest of black folks or poor folks. So that was a major mobilization, it took a lot of time and energy, and it was, you know, it was a success, a limited success. But we made a statement and there was an attempt to organize the women who had signed that ad into an organization after that. And there were networks that emerged and sustained themselves, but not for, you know, very long.',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't say that, actually. I think we had been talking about some of the issues that came out with Anita Hill. I mean, one of the issues was also the way in which race and gender get dichotomized. Sometimes in the press they were saying there are people who support Anita Hill as a woman and there are people who support Clarence Thomas as a man, you know, as a black man, I'm sorry. So there was the idea that there were black issues and then women's issues--and that sort--where does that leave black women? And part of our statement was of course--there's an intersection, as Kimberle Crenshaw [Kimberle Williams Crenshaw] and others have said, there's an intersection between race and gender and class and sexuality, and that we need to understand the relationship of all these things to each other rather than pitting them, you know, against each other, or falsely dividing the categories.\",\n",

He enrolled as a soldier in the trenches of England, learned the hard way you don't sign up for war.

So once again we were the great-grandchildren of slaves and slave owner and occupied an unusual position within the slavery regime because my white law partner, Molly Munger insists that I claim my white ancestors and so she did a history project and discovered letters amongst some of the women who owned my ancestors and they\\'re discussing Julia Head [Julia Head Rice] who married one of my ancestors [Rice\\'s paternal great-grandfather, John Wesley Rice] on the Rice side. And Julia Head was a common ancestor of Condoleezza Rice and myself and she was also half white and the family did not ship her out, they kept her as almost a relative and from North Carolina migration out to Birmingham [Alabama] kept Julia. The letters are concerning the fact that Julia, a mulatto slave who was their half-sister just like Sally Hemings was unhappy serving Charlotta [ph.]. So they were having a family conference letter about where to place Julia in another household within the extended family so that Julia would be happier (laughter). So one of my friends said, \"Y\\'all were uppity and a problem even when you were slaves you didn\\'t know how to behave.\" So that was an interesting correspondence to (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This ancestor is Julia Head was actually, I guess as many who read about Thomas Jefferson, his son actually served him in the house. Speaker 1: Yes that\\'s Sally Hemings. Sally Hemings was the half-sister of Thomas Jefferson\\'s wife and also his lover very strange incestuous relationships. Speaker 2: But then his son becomes actually a servant in his house when he gets (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly that\\'s right. Speaker 2: You would think with the sibling rivalry that we have now and we don\\'t have slavery what that might have been like. Speaker 1: That must have been extremely poisonous. A very strange and toxic dynamic to have your half slave siblings whom you couldn\\'t claim as family members but yet they were there and for some reason this particular set of families did not ship out their half white, half slave children they kept them. Now on the other side of the family, my mother\\'s [Anna Barnes Rice] side of the family her grandfather [George Wigenton] was shipped to the next county. So he was born in Culpeper County [Virginia] but he was sent to Rappahannock County [Virginia] to live in the slave shack that I described because he was an affront to the white landlady--to white lady of the house and her husband was sleeping with her slaves and impregnating them and she did not want to see the children who looked like him who were half black. So in that household you didn\\'t keep them but in the Rice household apparently you did, very, very strange',\n",
       "  'Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know when I say that it\\'s unforgiveable I\\'m talking about the choices of folks who\\'ve been given a menu of choices and then choose not to achieve, which is what I saw in Shaker Heights High School [Shaker Heights, Ohio] that was just a choice. When we told folk, \"Look you need to be in this track. These are the courses that can get you into the higher level colleges,\" and people would say, \"We don\\'t want to work that hard,\" and then we ch\\nllenge them even more and they still turn it down. There was no excuse as far as I was concerned. What I see today is also in the black middle class a laziness and I don\\'t forget that they know we know too much. When I\\'m working with clients in the housing projects and I\\'m in the underclass areas of white America and black America and Latino America or I\\'m on the Native American reservations where the deprivation and the poverty are high. When I\\'m in Appalachia, when I\\'m in housing projects where you have underclass African Americans and you look at the environmental killers in their environments everything from the nutrition to the lead poisoning to the violence. These are kids who have post-traumatic stress syndrome and absolutely interferes with their ability to understand their choices and then you look at the schools and the quality of their schools and some of these schools couldn\\'t teach the sculptured poodles in Beverly Hills [California] how to bark. Even if you did want those schools offered, you would barely be literate. So their choices are different and the culture that I see developing in underclass communities is devastating but it is a culture that copes with an environment that is so deprived. It\\'s almost gotten to a \\'Clockwork Orange\\' counterculture that you have a cult of violence and children don\\'t see anything else around them. So achievement is neither possible, in fact achievement is now being defined in terms of a prison culture. Achievement is getting into a gang, achievement means getting power so that you don\\'t become a victim of the rape you saw in the hallway. I\\'m talking about in the hot spots; I\\'m not talking about all of poor black America. I\\'m talking about an underclass black America where poverty is dysfunctional.',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: Yes I took--one of the areas that were absolutely fascinating is I took several courses from Orlando Patterson and from Martin Kilson [Martin L. Kilson, Jr.]. Orlando Patterson is an expert in slavery and the African diaspora and so I learned the different types of slavery and I learned how most of our predecessors--our ancestors from the African strain of our background came first from the Caribbean. So most slave ships came to the Caribbean and went to South and Central America. Very few actually landed with slave holds that landed in Maryland and Virginia and so forth. So that was one of the surprising things and then of course the different systems of slavery and what that meant for where we came from. My family not only did it have the advantages of being the Sally Hemings in the slave world the bastard children of the owners--slave owners but also a number of Native American relatives in there so for people who had that kind of background and did not have to toil number one in the big farms in Mississippi the huge plantations which were Haitian style. They had the Haitian style of slavery which meant that they didn't care whether you lived or died. You can tell how brutal the farm was by how far away the master lived and most of the farms in Mississippi and Louisiana for example, the master's mansion is not like 'Gone With the Wind' [Margaret Mitchell] with your plantation right there with Scarlett [Scarlett O'Hara] waving happily at her happy slaves. Those slave mansions had to be--slave owner mansions had to be five, six, seven miles away because the farms were so brutal and you had to have black overseers because people were so--people enslaved on those plantations were so brutalized that it didn't even make economic sense to have them breed--to have them reproduce. So the Haitian model which was the most brutal model they simply worked you to death. It was actually worse than how animals were treated. The\",\n",

So they hired her to be a maid, something she had done in their houses. So she was a maid. She joined the union though, and she didn't let that be widely known because that was a bit controversial if you joined the union. She joined the union, and she was convinced at a certain point that she should apply for one of those jobs on the floor in the production line because she could make more money on an hourly salary. She did, and because she had seniority built up as a maid, she was able to get ahead of some others who had applied for that job. She got the job, and there was resistance to her having the job because she was black, and she was a woman. And it got so bad that white men would spread feces all over the men's restroom, knowing that she had to clean it up. They did all kinds of things to harass her. So she complained, and her union rep and also the person that was the supervisor took my mother's side and told the men that if they continued doing that, they were gonna lose their job.

So it was a big story from the jump because it affected that part of society in New York [New York City, New York]. And it was my story.

As you know, 2013 was the year that three women [Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight] were found, you know, to have been locked in a house for a decade. Well, for the last three years, we have been pushing the state to do a better job of examining rape kits and, you know, I think our content, as well as, you know, other developments, have sort of moved the state to a place where it\\'s more effectively and efficiently testing rape kits, and thousands of rapes are being resolved as a result of much of the work that we\\'re doing. And so, you know, we are continuing to push to--particularly, you know, for poor women whose credibility is questionable, they\\'ve never--you know, they rarely have been able to get anybody to listen to their cries. And now the state attorney general [Mike DeWine] has made a commitment to testing every untested rape kit that\\'s out there, and there are about four thousand, and they\\'re about a third of the way through. And in some cases, the offenders are in custody; you know, they\\'re right there but no one\\'s ever tested and no one\\'s ever asked, and so for many families, including families who\\'ve had people not just rape but murder, some of those murders have been resolved in the past year. In one case, a woman\\'s daughter was killed thirty years ago and just gotten to a place where she knows what happened. But as it relates to the rape kits specifically, there\\'s a twenty year statute of limitations, and so there\\'s this race to get those tested before that statute runs out. Story_ID: 653800 Speaker 1: One of the reasons the whole discussion of the rape kits is important is, if you recall, in 2008, the bodies of eleven dead women were found either in the house or in the yard of a serial killer in Cleveland [Ohio]; his name was Anthony Sowell-- Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous). Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so if you look on our front page the day that Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was elected, when you get to the second front page [of The Plain Dealer], you see the developments around the Anthony Sowell murders.

Since that time, other women have come forward to say, \"Yes, I reported being raped by him and the police didn\\'t do anything.\" So that really was the catalyst for this work. And then when you fast forward to 2013 and you see the Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight developments, it just makes the case for why this work is so critically important. So we\\'re--you know, if we have to look at what was our signature content in 2013, in addition to covering the live story of the escape of these women who lived this decade of captivity, it\\'s really the impact of our journalism on the potential to reduce this fr\\nm continuing to happen; so, you know, we think that\\'s, we think that\\'s important.

And, so, that was probably--that was--it was a bad--it was a rough year, cause Latrice was young (simultaneous) Speaker 2: Sounds like it was a traumatic year. Speaker 1: It was a very traumatic year, but a year of growth. Because you wonder everyday, you know, how do you go on dealing with all of this. But it, it was for a reason, I was, I was just being made. I was, you know, I'm not bitter because of it, or.... I tell you that because I want people to understand that I was not exempt from tragedy, or you know, traumatic things. I haven't lived this fairytale type life. Bad things have happened to me too, you know, bad ordinary things.

In Springfield, I believe, probably in retrospect I would say what was even more difficult than being any one of those things singularly was being very young and being all of those things. And I had a tendency to take life very seriously. I once had a Spousal Rape Bill, and I remember presenting my Rape Bill before the, a committee and the reaction of the men, even the ones who were my, the more liberal ones, we had a Rape Study Commission, and even some of my colleagues from the Rape Study Commission were just so clearly opposed to this bill and opposed to the notion that \"If you\\'re married, there\\'s no such thing as rape\", you know, and I remember \"What kind of--\" and I remember being disillusioned, sitting there looking at these monsters. One time I, during the ERA, the height of the ERA, there were lots of protestors, and so there were women who would come and chain themselves to the, in the rotunda, and so the marshals came out, and the state marshals had drug these women, they were dragging these women into the jails, there was actually a jail cell down in the basement. And I thought, you know, their heads are hitting the railing, and I thought, so I told them, I said \"You\\'re gonna hurt these women. Don\\'t do that.\" Next thing I know, they were dragging me off, and I told them I was a member. They did not believe it. And, so, I\\'m sitting cooling my heels in jail downstairs with these other protestors, and thank God for other black women. Ethel Skyles(?) Alexander and Carol Mosely Braun said \"It\\'s mighty quiet from the back.\" And, so, finally Ethyl told Carol \"Monica wouldn\\'t miss all these votes. We haven\\'t heard her mouth\", and so they came to look for me. Now, I don\\'t know how in the world, they would, why they would look for me in the jail. I don\\'t remember how they got down there, but I was just sitting around, and I remember hearing Ethel say \"That one right over there. Baby, let her out right now. She is a member.\" And she blasted them. The next thing I knew, keys were rattling and I was yanked out of the holding cell, and dusted off and I was back in my seat, and Jim Edgar was the Secretary of State, and he came by and apologized profusely, but I never made a big deal out of it, but I just, you know, so I felt life is so precarious, you know, one minute I\\'m sitting in the chamber, and the next minute, I\\'m in the jail.

And I knew that he was on leave, but everything was redacted about it. Even, you know, he was on leave but you know, even why he was on leave. And I went to my editor and I said to him, \"You know what? I got this tip; I need some time, you know to try and see if I can get the story.\" He was like, \"Are you kidding? You know, are the--you are the new police reporter, you\\'re not gonna take two weeks to, you know, dive into something that we don\\'t even know what\\'s going to come of it. No way.\" So I remember going back to my desk feeling so discouraged and Sydney must have overheard me, or maybe I had mentioned it to her. And she asked me what happened. I said, \"Well you know, oh well.\" She said, \"Did he tell you what to do after work?\" I said, \"No.\" She said, \"Did he tell you what to do on the weekends?\" I said, \"Well if I\\'m not working, no.\" She said, \"You can do as much or as little as you want about this story.\" And it was the most empowering thing that anyone ever told me. It was about kind of being able to set your own agenda within the parameters of what--so during the day I wrote about shootings and whatever. And then on the weekends I, I figured out where this was, this incident supposedly occurred. I went--I, I handed out my card. She said, \"Have you done everything?\" I was like, \"No.\" She was like, \"Do everything.\" And finally one day I had the case number. I called the police department [Miami Police Department], the records unit and I said, \"I\\'ve got case number blah, blah, blah, blah, and I\\'m just looking for the, the address of the incident.\" And the person looked it up and laughed. I remember he was a man, he laughed. He said, \"Who are you?\" And you can\\'t lie about who you are. I said, \"I\\'m with the Miami Herald,\" and he gave me the information. And I went, I found the woman and it was a banner head--you know, story across the front page.

I remember her name, Jamie Jimenez. But, they, they decided they actually needed to create a staff position for someone to deal with the allegations and things coming in 'cause generally how universities handled this was they would, you know, just try to handle it quietly through university channels and separate the two students, maybe move the guy to another dorm across campus so that they wouldn't be living in the same dorm or whatever. Speaker 2: You mean a guy who is guilty of sexual assault? Speaker 1: Well, I mean, keep in mind, universities are not courts of law. They are not judges and juries and often in cases of campus sexual assault, we see that it's his word against hers and there's alcohol involved or other drugs and the credibility of the woman is challenged and, you know, it's, it's a very--as we're--as we still see today, it's an extremely difficult, difficult issue.\",\n",

In where the company had to pay thirty thousand dollars to clean up the walls, it was a small company, I walked through the headquarters and, and, like, you know, in fifteen minutes. If I could, if it was that small, then clearly, surely the CEO should have seen that, and affirmative action rules that you make an effort, an affirmative step to prevent discrimination. He should have had that stuff off the walls. The women shoudn\\'t have been harassed the way they were, and the \"N\" word certainly shouldn\\'t have been used. One guy was officially fired.

And understand we don\\'t need, we didn\\'t need complaints in order to go in and do an investigation, you know. If you worked or you were a federal contractor, you essentially, you waived your rights in some respects, so, we\\'d go in and do a compliance review and we learned, first of all, in the parking lot, the compliance office said he saw all of these Confederate flags flying so he, he knew he was kind of in trouble. I\\'m serious. This was 1990s now. He went in and saw the racist graffiti on the bathroom wall and sexist graffiti. He learned that one young man and this company [TIMCO Aviation Services, Inc.] repaired aircraft equipment, for I think the [U.S.] Air Force, gentleman was raffling his grandfather\\'s Ku Klux Klan [KKK] knife on the shop floor. Okay. Yes I was, 1990s? I\\'m thinking we\\'re talking about the glass ceiling. Speaker 2: Now this is where again? Speaker 1: In Greensboro, North Carolina. Speaker 2: Greensboro, okay. Speaker 1: And women were not spared either. I mean this is kind of a blue collar rough and tumble job I guess. One--it was so bad, I flew down there, and that\\'s not something I ever did, to meet with the CEO. They said a couple of guys had these hoods that they turn around backwards to look like members of the Klan just to scare black people. But the women, I never thought women, four white women, who had just resigned because they couldn\\'t stand it. One was a licensed aircraft mechanic. They said, first of all they didn\\'t allow her to do anything but hand out the tools, and they called them, as the old folks would say, everything but the child of God, including the C word on the shop floor, and these women were in tears because I\\'m sure these jobs paid well, okay, but they couldn\\'t stand the--it\\'s a hostile environment and sexual harassment straight up. One woman is a story, I\\'m telling, it\\'s sounds unbelievable, but, I mean I\\'ve heard \\'em in other parts of the country, so now I\\'m convinced it really happened. This woman was being harassed by her supervisor and one day, the story goes, he--she was in the elevator with her and grabbed and basically said, \"I\\'ve got you alone now.\" They\\nsaid the door opened, she keep going and never looked back. She just, you know--I can\\'t stand this anymore, I\\'m out of here. So I went down there with my colleague from my agency [U.S. Department of Labor] and I said didn\\'t you know this was going on, because the blacks said they tried to meet with him to tell him what was happening, and somewhere in the conversation, he indicated, well, there aren\\'t that many members of the Klan in here. Okay. One is too many. Needless to say, the company was found out of compliance, and of course, they settled, signed a conciliation agreement. Unfortunately, this agency is opposed to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC] couldn\\'t get punitive damages \\'cause was a case if ever I had seen one for punitive damages. And after I got back, this gentleman who sounded like an Anglo, if I may so generalize, he said not only were we right in what we found, but there was one guy, the one guy who was a supervisor, they say when he didn\\'t make the meetings, they didn\\'t call him Johnny or Joe, they called him the N, okay. He said the N-word is used all over the place, profusely, okay? They were angry because we always get news releases and the point of that was not to embarrass a company but to show other companies to try to obviously hinder that happening someplace else. It was a way to induce behavioral changes.

I work with colleagues that, for example, do sexual harassment prevention training in the [Washington] D.C. Department of Corrections. There was a major sexual harassment case brought by women, mostly black women, correctional officers, okay? And so again, these are African Americans and I, to the court's credit, they require this sexual harassment training of managers and staff and refresher training, and I think some companies need to take a look at that because not only for sexual harassment purposes, but racial harassment, as we talked about with the [Ku Klux] Klan raffle case in North Carolina.

She said because after everything I've heard it made me think about sometimes you walk down the hallway and you look at somebody and you think that they think that they're cute, you have no idea what that person's story is what it took for them to get to school that morning and it just said it all. It's that game face, it hides everything and the minute you want to start to get catty and think something, you just don't know. So it's really just--and amazing things have come out of young people's sexual abuse.

Because she is very--she was--is--it's so recent that she passed away, but she was very fair skin, she had blue, blueish gray eyes just like my [maternal] grandfather [Robert Scott, Sr.]. She had Indian [Native American] type hair and by that I mean literally you could wash it and dry the car and it still looked pretty, you know, if I do that my hair does a gigantic, you know, Afro poof, you know, so (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I like Afros, you know.

And the children came out a little brown and he got divorced merrily. The second, the second was to an Indian woman [Leola Eldridge Scott] and the third was to a very dark skin African American woman [Bennie Carter Scott].

And they\\'re like, \"We\\'ll get kicked off the team.\" So it was just like, it was (laughter) it was, it was not pretty. But I did date a guy and so of course he wasn\\'t on, he was, he had been an athlete, but he is now an engineer and he was older and my dad was just like (sigh) you know, so yeah. I will tell you this. I dated interracially and I still do because that\\'s the environment you grow up in. And my dad was very negative about me dating white men and that changed.

And, so, you know, and [maternal] great-granddaddy [Robert Scott] was half white and his daddy [Richard Hill (ph.)] was white. So, you know, what are saying? So it was like this challenge between my dad and I because he knew the story of his mother [Willie Mae McNeil Scott] being raped. He knew the story of, you know, other women as he would say, who had been raped and he was very afraid for me that something bad could happen and nobody would do anything about it. So that was a big clash in college with my dad and I. And my mom [JoAnn Scott Wilson] was like, he\\'s nice, he\\'s cute, you know, so it was like this very interesting dichotomy with us--',\n",
       "  \"Speaker 2: My father was born in a small town that was a railroad depot that died out, and it's a black town. It was a black town called Littig, L-I-T-T-I-G, Texas, which is right outside of Bastrop [Texas] or Austin [Texas] in this, in the outskirts of the town and-- Speaker 1: Is there, is there a story about the--that town, I mean the name (simultaneous)? Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's similar to Rosewood [Texas], yep, yep. So you've heard of this, yep and, so that's where all the blacks live now. The interesting thing is if you think about my mother's [JoAnn Scott Wilson] side of the family, it's more of a professional class, educated or at least aspirational to be educated. My father's side of the family was very working class. His father actually helped put the railroads down. Not working on the railroad train but, putting the railroad ties down across the State of Texas. So a working man, and, but Littig was--I actually--my dad--when I was a little girl drove, he drove us to this little town. He did a little turn off and what was left of their property was just a little water spout. And dad said this town used to be a bustling town, railroad depot, and then they rerouted the train away and the whole town died afterwards. Speaker 1: So it is now what they call a ghost town I guess. Speaker 2: It's somewhat--I mean--I think there, there are some development there with, you know, maybe fishing and spa and golf. But it's not owned by black folks like it once was. His, his stories are more harrowing and very sad, and very--dad doesn't ever really want to revisit that and his older brothers and sisters don't either. His family, so-- Speaker 1: Now he really isn't that old. He, he's like well, (unclear) (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My dad is seventy. He'll be seventy this year. Speaker 1: All right. So he was born more like-- Speaker 2: So he was born on June 1st, 1940. Speaker 1: Right. Speaker 2: And he's the youngest, so his eldest brother was a guy named Doris [Doris Wilson]. Doris was actually very smart. He was the product of a rape, though. His--my grandmother [Pauline Ross Wilson] was very fair skinned again similar to my mother's mother [Willie Mae McNeil Scott], and how would I describe it, she was very elegant, classy even, you know, held herself with a regalness that, you know, but she was a housekeeper. But she still was, you know, did quilting and canning of perserves and almost I use--she was the ecofriendly guru to my life, right now if you think about it, she reused everything from aluminum foil to, you know, having a backyard garden. And I think that what I remember most about her is she was a very giving person, a very loving person. The--I'm bouncing around but I will simply say her first son was a product of a rape. She was raped by a black man, so her son turned our very dark skinned, and then all of the subsequent children after she married my grandfather are very brown skinned. So Uncle Doris--if you think about the timeframe when my dad was a little boy, Uncle Doris was in World War I [WWI]. So my father was a little boy and his older brother was in World War I. So there was this, there was this huge divide almost within the family. Because there's all these children and they're all different ages, and in fact--because by then my grandfather was a bit older, we called him grandpapa, what you actually saw was the eldest son caring for the family with his check.\",\n",

She takes on women that have been displaced by the Lord s Resistance Army, or the LRAs, that came through Uganda, terrorized a lot of the villages. A lot of the women got raped and had children out of wedlock. It s very frowned upon over there, and so most of them couldn t go home to their families. She took all these women in, took on their babies and their children, and taught them all a trade so that they could support themselves. She would teach them to sew or to do things, clerical things, and gave them a new life. When Pros for Africa got teamed up with her, they decided to make this big trip.

In many ways I was fortunate to grow up in a time when those issues were coming to surface and I had the opportunity to work on those issues. Now mind you, not everyone was receptive to hearing about those issues. Not everyone was receptive to addressing those issues, but the inequities were real and sometimes are still real.

       "  \"I think a common misperception was that Asians didn't have this problem of domestic violence, because their families were harmonious, or if they did have the problem, they just keep to themselves, and they wouldn't utilize a shelter.

       "  \"MASAKI: Yeah, I mean there's a lot of similarities and differences. I think that the differences are...Many times in trafficking cases, there's more than one victim at a time or one family at a time, and multiple survivors. For example, the police did a huge raid, which they called Operation Gilded Cage, and hundreds of trafficking survivors were a part of this case. So then that is a huge challenge. Asian Women's' Shelter, even at that time, is a sixteen-bed capacity shelter, and also sometimes it's supportive for trafficking survivors to be able to be together, but sometimes it's not. And also for the prosecution or the legal aspect, sometimes for legal reasons, the prosecution didn't want trafficking survivors to live together. So there's these kind of complicated issues that most of other survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence don't have as much. Also the difference about the crime rings. You know, very sophisticated networks of perpetrators. It's not just one isolated perpetrator that you might have in a domestic violence or a sexual assault case. I mean, sometimes it's very similar. So in some kind of trafficking, like for example, domestic workers. A lot of domestic workers are trafficked and exploited, and that might be very similar to a domestic violence case, where it's one person that was brought over to be a nanny but then really kept like a prisoner in that home. So in that way, it's very similar to the kinds of situation that, say, somebody who married into a family, where the perpetrator was abusive, her partner was abusive, and even the extended family was abusive. There's a lot of parallels there. So both. There are a lot of things that are the same, and a lot that are different. Also the legal recourse is different. What are the legal remedies that trafficking survivors can access? As well as what the legal remedies for domestic violence survivors or sexual assault survivors [are]. KWON\",\n",
       "  \"aspect of the work. So that's why I would say that a lot of the Asian-based programs for gender-based violence are also...probably if you ask all of them, and now in my new position at API Institute, I see that most all of the community-based groups are working also with trafficking survivors. Whether they advertise that or not, they are. And a lot of the trafficking survivors have the intersection of experience. They have been sexually abused, or they might be children, who grew up with incest or child sexual abuse. They might have been escaping domestic violence or sexual abuse, and then found themselves caught in a trafficking situation, or they might've been trafficked and then sexually abused or in a domestic violence situation. So the intersection of all these gender-based violences really overlaps a lot, and a lot of them ...the survivors...they will tell you the stories of their experience, but they're not going to say, Oh, I'm a sexual abuse survivor, or, Oh, I'm a domestic violence survivor, you know? Those are kind of artificial constructs, based on the law or our definitions, but survivors themselves often have the experience of the overlap of different kinds of abuse that they've experienced. KWON\",\n",
       "  \"that? MASAKI: Because we were airing our dirty laundry. We were saying, Hey, the domestic violence, the sexual violence happens for Asian women. And it's not just men outside of our race that are committing these crimes against Asian women, but it's within our own community. And it's also patriarchal cultures and values that are upholding this or turning away or making it an invisible problem or blaming the victim. So that kind of critique of our own community, especially in a time or an era where there was still a lot of discrimination against our communities, I think, was controversial. And it's really quite surprising that even then the...it took till the eighties, the late eighties, before there were any women's organizations within the Asian community, by and for women. Asian Immigrant Women Advocates, AIWA and Asian Women's Shelter were started...I think Asian Immigrant Women Advocates was started in 1987 or 86, and then Asian Women's Shelter in 1988, when we opened, were the first Asian women's organizations here in the Bay Area. It seems like it should've...it's a long time coming.\",\n",

MASAKI: Right, well the population that it served was supposed to be for everybody, and in San Francisco, 35 percent of the population is of different Asian descent, but no Asians came to that shelter. This was in the early eighties, like 1983. I think a common misperception was that Asians didn't have this problem of domestic violence, because their families were harmonious, or if they did have the problem, they just keep to themselves, and they wouldn't utilize a shelter. So for me, that wasn't a sufficient answer, because I knew that survivors of domestic violence and sexual violence were a part of our Asian community, and I felt that it was because they didn't have access to meaningful services, that that's why they weren't coming to the shelter or accessing other resources.

       "  \"A lot of people weren't going to seek reproductive health, because they had survived sexual violence and they were like, I just don't deal with anything around any of that. I feel like I really...and so many of the people that I talked to and ended up working with had been survivors of child sexual abuse as well, and that that was just something that was a huge barrier around not only them seeking reproductive health services but also in their ability to be able to be involved in a lot of work. A lot of people were still carrying huge amounts of trauma and still had a lot of healing that they didn't [do], because they didn't have access to healing services or anything like that. Coming into the work, I started with the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative, and we partnered with Generation Five, really coming into the work around a clear strategic vision around like...Given how prevalent child sexual abuse is and given how devastating the impacts are in our community...If it really is one in four girls and one in six boys, and those are just estimates, they say. They actually estimate that it's much higher than that, given that most people don't even report child sexual abuse. So if we know that it's probably higher than one in four girls and one in six boys, given the prevalence, given the lasting impacts that it's just had on one person, and then multiplying that by everyone, it's not just about impacts on relationships, which directly impact your community, because in my mind, our communities are going to be what holds our revolutions. There is no good organizer in my mind that's also not doing community building, because they're so connected. Community is like the foundation that organizing gets built upon. A lot of that's misogyny and all thatpatriarchal mess that doesn't get...community building doesn't get recognized as real work but whatever. But given that, the child sexual abuse then becomes a strategic place to do work on, that then becomes a strategic generational place to do work on, because you can literally see how not just child sexual abuse, but intimate violence as well, but particularly child sexual abuse is passed down generation to generation. So strategically going for that hitting that mark, trying to intervene the cycle around child sexual abuse, which is often times the first place where people are being taught or learning about power and control, learning about oppression. We talk about it as the building blocks of oppression, and the building blocks of what normalizes violence later on, normalizes reproductive violence, [and] normalizes all kinds of other forms of violence. That is the first place where people are learning that consent doesn't exist and that their voice does not matter, and [where people are] learning shame about their bodies...all of these themes that reproductive justice really heavily hits on and should hit on in my opinion. Child sexual abuse is also a strategic place for organizing and for all of our movements, because it's not just about this secret thing that gets hidden that happens in people's home. The state uses child sexual abuse, whether it's rape as a weapon of war...we know a lot of those rapes happen to children and young women who are not full-grown women yet, and to boys and to people who are not boys or women, who are intersex whatever. We know that the sex work and the sex trafficking that happens around the militarization, and we know the long history of Native American boarding schools and child sexual abuse being used as a tool for colonization, like all of these things. The State obviously doesn't have...if it's using child sexual abuse, it doesn't have a vested interest in ending it. So I feel like my CSA work actually is a lot about reproductive justice and I bring a lot of my reproductive justice work with me, because I just think they're just so deeply tied, and there's no way...it's impossible to separate intimate violence, and particularly sexual violence, from reproductive justice anyways. But yeah, that's the work that I do now and I feel like that's where my heart really is, because I haven't come across a community where child sexual abuse doesn't exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people don't talk about child sexual abuse. And yet I meet so many Asian women survivors of CSA all the time, who come up to me after I've spoken somewhere or after they read about my work. They don't have anywhere to go. There's no services. Because even those larger services that we were talking about, in that survivor realm, I mean a lot of women of color don't even access those services because of the silence and the added targeting that you're putting your community at risk and your self at risk for, if you come out as a survivor. There's so many pieces to why I feel really passionate around my CSA work, and then the transformative justice piece of it, I feel is just exactly right on the money, because so many of our folks don't report it and don't' seek services because they are scared of what the state will do. They are scared of deportation, they are scare of people being harassed and beaten again or locked up and taken to prison, or because they can't call the cops cause the last time the cops came to their house, they ended up raping them. There's so many things, so it feels like a really natural progression in my mind. I hope that it makes sense in other people's minds.\",\n",
       "  'have you, where people don\\'t have kind of a framework to even put themselves into. And at the same time, the year when I was adopted, my mother along with nine other women, founded the Women\\'s Coalition of St. Croix, and they\\'re a domestic violence organization, and they help victims of domestic violence, rape, sexual assault. One of the founding members is Audre Lorde. So it\\'s through that work [that] there was a profound, really strong, political framework. You know, I grew up in this really close-knit, strong feminist community that was all around this organization, building the organization from the ground up. And so we would have conversations, you know, we\\'d talk about white supremacy at the dinner table, people knew what homophobia was, you know? There were lesbian couples that were part of our community, who had been together for like twenty years, ten years, and you know, it wasn\\'t like an issue; it was just that\\'s who they were. And so I had like that, but I think that...and then I had this other piece of the political framework that wasn\\'t so much about an analysis around oppressions, but that was also about a deep sense of justice and service and what activism means...and it\\'s weird to even call it activism because so much of it feels like it\\'s just my life\\'s work. You know, it\\'s not like this special thing I do on the side or anything; it\\'s just how you live your life, and what it means to actually mobilize people. So I grew up in that, and I grew up around a lot of...the group that founded the coalition was a very multi-racial group of women of color, White women. I feel like from a young age, I really got a profound sense of, one, just seeing women organizing for themselves, when no one else would, and internalizing into my bones that you don\\'t need a college special course to do activism, you don\\'t need to go to a fancy training, you don\\'t need to know fancy language, or speak the \"right\"\\x9d way or all these ridiculous things that we\\'re taught now, and that the way that political work I feel like gets professionalized and this elitism around it. I just feel like from growing in that environment, I just saw people just being like, There\\'s a need in our community. We need to do something. How do we create what we need? And it\\'s not perfect, you learn as you go, but they did it, and it\\'s still alive now. And then the other thing I feel like I got from that experience growing up was just this deep profound understanding of violence and how systemic it was and how pervasive it was. And that it wasn\\'t just the five...it wasn\\'t just like my friends who were like experiencing violence, but it was everybody, particularly intimate violence, which is mostly what they worked on, but they worked on intimate violence in the context...like everybody does...of state violence, of all kinds of community violence, of everything. I remember spending Saturday afternoons in the waiting room, playing with kids as their moms went in and out to the counselors. In the early early days, people would spend the night at our house to escape in the middle of the night to fly off the island, because you can\\'t just drive to the next county or anything. I didn\\'t have the language for it, but I knew that it was larger than just a couple of bad people, you know what I mean? It was so many people and so many families, and so many different kinds of families. It wasn\\'t just about poor people, it wasn\\'t about just women of color, it wasn\\'t...None of that mattered. It was all kinds of different folks, and I definitely got a deep sense of the engendered piece of...or I don\\'t know if that\\'s the correct way to say it...but the gender piece of how violence is perpetuated, particularly around women, folks who are identified as female, people who present as feminine, people who present as women, people who are mistaken as women, all of those things felt really profound as well. I don\\'t know that I would\\'ve had the fancy words to describe it then, but I know that I also came to a place inside of myself, like something...it\\'s like tectonic plates or something...something just shifted and aligned where I didn\\'t want to just be part of responding to violence, but I really wanted to be a part of making the violence stop. Because even though I knew that the work that my mom\\'s organization did and the work that the women and the people who were in that community did all the time...which ranged from everything from being part of the advocate hotline and going in the middle of the night to assist victims to running the beeper training program to helping to train the police to helping to run the organization to everything, to helping to cook the meals for the meeting. There was collective childcare all the time, because most of the people who were doing the main work were a lot of single mothers. There were a lot of people who didn\\'t have dual income households. There was a lot of death, there were a lot of hard times, and St. Croix has a lot of poverty on it as well. I saw that type of work, and so I knew it was really good work, but I also knew that it wasn\\'t lessening the incidences of violence, and it was helping to create a culture where people could come out about violence and where people could address the consequences of violence and the impact of violence, but [it was] not necessarily doing anything to shift the reasons why violence was happening. And I don\\'t say that with any judgment, because I know and I\\'ve seen literally first hand as their organization just continues to grow, and they\\'re still at capacity. Like they literally cannot help all the people who need help, and I think that\\'s true for most of our direct service organizations, who are doing great work on the front lines...and you know, I mean obviously it\\'s never...it\\'s not perfect, and there\\'s a lot of critiques that people have and that I have as well and like I have a lot of respect for those people who are doing work in the trenches and on the front lines because it\\'s not easy work and they often times don\\'t have the support that they need like in terms of...everything from like the constant intake of trauma that they have to the long hours to the little amounts of pay...all that kind of stuff. But I think there was something about that kind of direct and immediate needs work that I saw that I just knew I wanted to be a part of building alternatives and like I said, at the time, I don\\'t think I really had that language, but I feel like that really shaped me in terms of how I understood the rest of my political work.',\n",
       "  \"But I remember being excited that I was there, and it felt like something to do. At the time, it was like...it's true in a lot of ways now, there are really just two branches in terms of feminist work that you can do. You can go into pro-choice and reproductive rights, health, or justice work or you can go into anti-violence and domestic violence and sexual assault, rape work. And I had done that [anti-violence] work, so I was like you know, this is the branch of the tree that I'm doing now, and it was great to see...well I had gone with my partner at the time, who's White, and then my two close friends who are both Black women, and it was great to see like women of color there and present, but you know, I think...I didn't really understand and I don't know if everybody else understood what it was for, you know what I mean? What was after the march?\",\n",
       "  \"MINGUS: It's a collective. So it's a group of community folks who...I mean, it sounds weird to say we're all volunteers because it's our life's work, so it's not like a volunteer thing, but none of us get paid currently. We have been meeting for two years. Our goal is to create transformative justice responses to child sexual abuse, so responses that don't rely on the State, so people are able to intervene in incidences or cases of child sexual abuse without having to call the police, without having to just send somebody to prison, a response that's not just about resisting violence but also about how do we cultivate and create the world that we want, meaning the things that actually will prevent violence from happening...like safety, healing, accountability, transformation, all those things. And so that's the work that we're doing. Our vision is a Bay Area where everybody has the skills and the capacity to be able to intervene or prevent an act of or an incident of child sexual abuse. And so our work is a lot...It's very different. It's alternatives building work. It's not direct needs or immediate needs work, which tends to be a lot of responding, responding. Our work is...I feel like it's a lot slower and deeper, and so we're working towards supporting our first trial intervention in three years, we'll be doing that. Until then, what we're doing is, currently right now, we are developing a possible accountability model for TJ intervention in CSA. We've been studying accountability models and processes that have already taken place...many of which are not around child sexual abuse, just given the unique risks involved...but seeing what's transferrable and what's not, in terms of interventions that have been successful or where there's pieces of it that have been successful. And so that's one. We'll be having our first draft of that on October 1, which is so exciting. The other big piece is the provider network work that we're doing. So the framework that we're working in is...Given where we're at, and given where we want to be, obviously we want to be where it's like there's healers in every school, there's like accountability circles that are just community run that people do, and everybody knows how to run an accountability process, and you know, people don't even need to be held accountable. They take accountability, right? They do something, they're like, I want to take accountability for this, right? It's not like, You did something wrong. Ever. That's where we want to be, and we know that that's a very long way between where we are and where we want to be. So in the mean time, what is the work going to look like? Obviously, we would love to have just a pure TJ intervention that never relies on the State and is totally community based and funded, whatever, but we know that that's not...We haven't built to the scope and scale that would allow for that yet. We're still a relatively small group of people in terms of how large child sexual abuse is when we think of the statistics, which are one in four girls, and one in six boys. That's huge, right? That number. The other piece that we know is most children are abused by people that they know, that serial child sexual abusers are like less than 2%. Most people are sexually abused by people that they know or are in their intimate networks. So we have like the pervasiveness of CSA that we're like trying to work on and hopefully end it, not just respond to it, and we haven't built to the scope and scale that we want, so how do we leverage what's already here? How do we leverage what's already in place? So the provider network is going to be building a network of providers that we'e able to leverage their services in support of interventions. When we look at the landscape of child sexual abuse, we know that by far, the biggest the most significant gap is around offenders. If we think about survivors, bystanders and offenders, we know that the gap of services for offenders is huge. At least...even if they're not perfect...there's a lot more services for survivors, and there's actually some services, a lot more services for by standers, whether it's like educational groups, support groups, whatever. But when it comes to offenders, it's pretty much like you either get locked up and put in jail, there's a lot of pathologizing and therapeutic stuff, and then there's some smaller more innovative things, but that's the biggest gap, so we know that we want to work there, and then in the meantime, how do we leverage what's already existing? For survivors, how do we sort through those services and find which ones are good? Which are the best support groups? Or which of the support groups are trans* friendly? Which of the support groups are not going to tell on you or report you if you're undocumented? Which of the support groups are held in accessible spaces, right? All of those things. Who is a gynecologist that we could recommend you to or refer you to that you could actually come out as a CSA survivor and they wouldn't be an asshole to you, or that they would know and be competent around some of the impacts that that might mean for not just your medical health but your emotional health as well and have a good bedside manner around that. So in the provider network, it's people who are either aligned with transformative justice, people who are movable, like if there's just one person in the organization, for example, or somebody who's like, Yes, I know, because I'm seeing firsthand how the system doesn't work, I don't...I know we need something different, but I just don't' have enough education, or people who are just the bests in their fields. So we're having our first gathering of that at the end of this week actually, which is super exciting. The other thing that we're doing in that provider network is that we're we just had our first draft of the system maps, which are visual maps for people to be able to see what the different pathways are if you decide to engage the State, or if somebody else...like if your neighbor calls CPS [Child Protective Services] on you. So that you can literally see, Okay, if CPS comes and gets involved, here is what the process looks like. Here is the number of times you'll have to show up in court. Here are the decision makers at each step. Here's what you need to know in terms of if somebody calls 911 vs. CPS. All of that. So that feels really exciting, too, to use as like a tool to educate people but also, again, like knowing that one of the defining characteristics of living with oppression is that you have to make really hard choices, and the choices you have are not choices...I mean you already know the critique of the pro-choice movement...and they're not always just. So we're trying to also figure out how do we work with what we have, knowing that for some people because we haven't built to the scope and scale yet that...We want to be able to hold survivor healing and maybe even accountability, to be able to hold bystander education and maybe accountability and healing here, too, to be able to hold offender transformation, accountability, all of that. We can't hold all of that yet, and we want to get to a place where we can, obviously, so what does it look like in the meantime? So that's the scope of our work right now, which feels exciting. KWON: It's huge. That's a really big vision. MINGUS: Yeah, yeah, but we also think this is...and I remember coming to this realization when I was doing reproductive justice work in Atlanta...that a lot of people were not going to the clinic, not because they didn't have a state issued ID, or because they didn't have anybody to watch their kid in the middle of the day, or because they were scared that [the providers] were going to be queerphobic or transphobic. A lot of people weren't going to seek reproductive health, because they had survived sexual violence and they were like, I just don't deal with anything around any of that. I feel like I really...and so many of the people that I talked to and ended up working with had been survivors of child sexual abuse as well, and that that was just something that was a huge barrier around not only them seeking reproductive health services but also in their ability to be able to be involved in a lot of work. A lot of people were still carrying huge amounts of trauma and still had a lot of healing that they didn't [do], because they didn't have access to healing services or anything like that. Coming into the work, I started with the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative, and we partnered with Generation Five, really coming into the work around a clear strategic vision around like...Given how prevalent child sexual abuse is and given how devastating the impacts are in our community...If it really is one in four girls and one in six boys, and those are just estimates, they say. They actually estimate that it's much higher than that, given that most people don't even report child sexual abuse. So if we know that it's probably higher than one in four girls and one in six boys, given the prevalence, given the lasting impacts that it's just had on one person, and then multiplying that by everyone, it's not just about impacts on relationships, which directly impact your community, because in my mind, our communities are going to be what holds our revolutions. There is no good organizer in my mind that's also not doing community building, because they're so connected. Community is like the foundation that organizing gets built upon. A lot of that's misogyny and all thatpatriarchal mess that doesn't get...community building doesn't get recognized as real work but whatever. But given that, the child sexual abuse then becomes a strategic place to do work on, that then becomes a strategic generational place to do work on, because you can literally see how not just child sexual abuse, but intimate violence as well, but particularly child sexual abuse is passed down generation to generation. So strategically going for that hitting that mark, trying to intervene the cycle around child sexual abuse, which is often times the first place where people are being taught or learning about power and control, learning about oppression. We talk about it as the building blocks of oppression, and the building blocks of what normalizes violence later on, normalizes reproductive violence, [and] normalizes all kinds of other forms of violence. That is the first place where people are learning that consent doesn't exist and that their voice does not matter, and [where people are] learning shame about their bodies...all of these themes that reproductive justice really heavily hits on and should hit on in my opinion. Child sexual abuse is also a strategic place for organizing and for all of our movements, because it's not just about this secret thing that gets hidden that happens in people's home. The state uses child sexual abuse, whether it's rape as a weapon of war...we know a lot of those rapes happen to children and young women who are not full-grown women yet, and to boys and to people who are not boys or women, who are intersex whatever. We know that the sex work and the sex trafficking that happens around the militarization, and we know the long history of Native American boarding schools and child sexual abuse being used as a tool for colonization, like all of these things. The State obviously doesn't have...if it's using child sexual abuse, it doesn't have a vested interest in ending it. So I feel like my CSA work actually is a lot about reproductive justice and I bring a lot of my reproductive justice work with me, because I just think they're just so deeply tied, and there's no way...it's impossible to separate intimate violence, and particularly sexual violence, from reproductive justice anyways. But yeah, that's the work that I do now and I feel like that's where my heart really is, because I haven't come across a community where child sexual abuse doesn't exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people don't talk about child sexual abuse. And yet I meet so many Asian women survivors of CSA all the time, who come up to me after I've spoken somewhere or after they read about my work. They don't have anywhere to go. There's no services. Because even those larger services that we were talking about, in that survivor realm, I mean a lot of women of color don't even access those services because of the silence and the added targeting that you're putting your community at risk and your self at risk for, if you come out as a survivor. There's so many pieces to why I feel really passionate around my CSA work, and then the transformative justice piece of it, I feel is just exactly right on the money, because so many of our folks don't report it and don't' seek services because they are scared of what the state will do. They are scared of deportation, they are scare of people being harassed and beaten again or locked up and taken to prison, or because they can't call the cops cause the last time the cops came to their house, they ended up raping them. There's so many things, so it feels like a really natural progression in my mind. I hope that it makes sense in other people's minds.\",\n",
       "  'you tell me a little bit more about the intersection between disability justice and RJ work? MINGUS: Yeah, yeah. So there\\'s the intersection of the content, of course. I began just asking questions, and that\\'s how it all started. They would give statistics around forced sterilization or around abortion or around sexual violence of women of color, or you know, all these different groups, and I would always ask, \"Well, what about disabled women?\"\\x9d or \"What about disabled people?\"\\x9d And they never had any statistics.',\n",
       "  'oing back to Atlanta, I\\'m like, \"Right.\"\\x9d Here it\\'s nice to be anonymous and...I don\\'t think I even realized how fucked up it was that I was harassed every day, because I was Asian and probably also because I was an Asian woman, but you know, here it\\'s...I feel like I can be anonymous, and people don\\'t...and not that people don\\'t do it, people certainly have and they do. It\\'s not like there is no racism out here either, which is totally untrue.',\n",
       "  \"How is it relevant now to the work that you do here? MINGUS: So my work is in two broad pieces. My work is disability justice, so I apply it all the time there, and then I do transformative justice work. So in that work, I feel like...The transformative justice work that I do is around community responses to child sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse is very, very pervasive, and just as the statistics that we're given say that people who are identified or assigned as girls are twice as likely to be victims of child sexual abuse, the same statistics are true around disabled children and adults, because there's also developmental stuff that gets complicated. But actually, in terms of gender, we actually think it's much more...we think it's much higher around people who get assigned as boys, too, but that there's less reporting. So it's hard to know. I feel like my TJ [transformative justice] around child sexual abuse, or CSA, work is disability justice work, because I know so many people who are survivors of child sexual abuse who are disabled people...myself included...and I know so many people who...I know that disabled communities don't talk it. No communities talk about child sexual abuse. So it's not just disabled communities, but given the prevalence, I think that it's something that disabled communities should be talking about and that most disabled children don't have access to community, don't have access...There's just so many more complications around disabled children, I feel like, that get added in around dependency and all that, so I feel like disability justice is certainly a huge piece of that work, too.\",\n",
       "  \"organization itself? MINGUS: It's not an organization. KWON: Oh, it's not? MINGUS: It's a collective. So it's a group of community folks who...I mean, it sounds weird to say we're all volunteers because it's our life's work, so it's not like a volunteer thing, but none of us get paid currently. We have been meeting for two years. Our goal is to create transformative justice responses to child sexual abuse, so responses that don't rely on the State, so people are able to intervene in incidences or cases of child sexual abuse without having to call the police, without having to just send somebody to prison, a response that's not just about resisting violence but also about how do we cultivate and create the world that we want, meaning the things that actually will prevent violence from happening...like safety, healing, accountability, transformation, all those things. And so that's the work that we're doing. Our vision is a Bay Area where everybody has the skills and the capacity to be able to intervene or prevent an act of or an incident of child sexual abuse. And so our work is a lot...It's very different. It's alternatives building work. It's not direct needs or immediate needs work, which tends to be a lot of responding, responding. Our work is...I feel like it's a lot slower and deeper, and so we're working towards supporting our first trial intervention in three years, we'll be doing that. Until then, what we're doing is, currently right now, we are developing a possible accountability model for TJ intervention in CSA. We've been studying accountability models and processes that have already taken place...many of which are not around child sexual abuse, just given the unique risks involved...but seeing what's transferrable and what's not, in terms of interventions that have been successful or where there's pieces of it that have been successful. And so that's one. We'll be having our first draft of that on October 1, which is so exciting. The other big piece is the provider network work that we're doing. So the framework that we're working in is...Given where we're at, and given where we want to be, obviously we want to be where it's like there's healers in every school, there's like accountability circles that are just community run that people do, and everybody knows how to run an accountability process, and you know, people don't even need to be held accountable. They take accountability, right? They do something, they're like, I want to take accountability for this, right? It's not like, You did something wrong. Ever. That's where we want to be, and we know that that's a very long way between where we are and where we want to be. So in the mean time, what is the work going to look like? Obviously, we would love to have just a pure TJ intervention that never relies on the State and is totally community based and funded, whatever, but we know that that's not...We haven't built to the scope and scale that would allow for that yet. We're still a relatively small group of people in terms of how large child sexual abuse is when we think of the statistics, which are one in four girls, and one in six boys. That's huge, right? That number. The other piece that we know is most children are abused by people that they know, that serial child sexual abusers are like less than 2%. Most people are sexually abused by people that they know or are in their intimate networks. So we have like the pervasiveness of CSA that we're like trying to work on and hopefully end it, not just respond to it, and we haven't built to the scope and scale that we want, so how do we leverage what's already here? How do we leverage what's already in place? So the provider network is going to be building a network of providers that we'e able to leverage their services in support of interventions. When we look at the landscape of child sexual abuse, we know that by far, the biggest the most significant gap is around offenders. If we think about survivors, bystanders and offenders, we know that the gap of services for offenders is huge. At least...even if they're not perfect...there's a lot more services for survivors, and there's actually some services, a lot more services for by standers, whether it's like educational groups, support groups, whatever. But when it comes to offenders, it's pretty much like you either get locked up and put in jail, there's a lot of pathologizing and therapeutic stuff, and then there's some smaller more innovative things, but that's the biggest gap, so we know that we want to work there, and then in the meantime, how do we leverage what's already existing? For survivors, how do we sort through those services and find which ones are good? Which are the best support groups? Or which of the support groups are trans* friendly? Which of the support groups are not going to tell on you or report you if you're undocumented? Which of the support groups are held in accessible spaces, right? All of those things. Who is a gynecologist that we could recommend you to or refer you to that you could actually come out as a CSA survivor and they wouldn't be an asshole to you, or that they would know and be competent around some of the impacts that that might mean for not just your medical health but your emotional health as well and have a good bedside manner around that. So in the provider network, it's people who are either aligned with transformative justice, people who are movable, like if there's just one person in the organization, for example, or somebody who's like, Yes, I know, because I'm seeing firsthand how the system doesn't work, I don't...I know we need something different, but I just don't' have enough education, or people who are just the bests in their fields. So we're having our first gathering of that at the end of this week actually, which is super exciting. The other thing that we're doing in that provider network is that we're we just had our first draft of the system maps, which are visual maps for people to be able to see what the different pathways are if you decide to engage the State, or if somebody else...like if your neighbor calls CPS [Child Protective Services] on you. So that you can literally see, Okay, if CPS comes and gets involved, here is what the process looks like. Here is the number of times you'll have to show up in court. Here are the decision makers at each step. Here's what you need to know in terms of if somebody calls 911 vs. CPS. All of that. So that feels really exciting, too, to use as like a tool to educate people but also, again, like knowing that one of the defining characteristics of living with oppression is that you have to make really hard choices, and the choices you have are not choices...I mean you already know the critique of the pro-choice movement...and they're not always just. So we're trying to also figure out how do we work with what we have, knowing that for some people because we haven't built to the scope and scale yet that...We want to be able to hold survivor healing and maybe even accountability, to be able to hold bystander education and maybe accountability and healing here, too, to be able to hold offender transformation, accountability, all of that.

We can't hold all of that yet, and we want to get to a place where we can, obviously, so what does it look like in the meantime? So that's the scope of our work right now, which feels exciting. KWON: It's huge. That's a really big vision. MINGUS: Yeah, yeah, but we also think this is...and I remember coming to this realization when I was doing reproductive justice work in Atlanta...that a lot of people were not going to the clinic, not because they didn't have a state issued ID, or because they didn't have anybody to watch their kid in the middle of the day, or because they were scared that [the providers] were going to be queerphobic or transphobic. A lot of people weren't going to seek reproductive health, because they had survived sexual violence and they were like, I just don't deal with anything around any of that. I feel like I really...and so many of the people that I talked to and ended up working with had been survivors of child sexual abuse as well, and that that was just something that was a huge barrier around not only them seeking reproductive health services but also in their ability to be able to be involved in a lot of work. A lot of people were still carrying huge amounts of trauma and still had a lot of healing that they didn't [do], because they didn't have access to healing services or anything like that. Coming into the work, I started with the Atlanta Transformative Justice Collaborative, and we partnered with Generation Five, really coming into the work around a clear strategic vision around like...Given how prevalent child sexual abuse is and given how devastating the impacts are in our community...If it really is one in four girls and one in six boys, and those are just estimates, they say. They actually estimate that it's much higher than that, given that most people don't even report child sexual abuse. So if we know that it's probably higher than one in four girls and one in six boys, given the prevalence, given the lasting impacts that it's just had on one person, and then multiplying that by everyone, it's not just about impacts on relationships, which directly impact your community, because in my mind, our communities are going to be what holds our revolutions. There is no good organizer in my mind that's also not doing community building, because they're so connected. Community is like the foundation that organizing gets built upon. A lot of that's misogyny and all thatpatriarchal mess that doesn't get...community building doesn't get recognized as real work but whatever. But given that, the child sexual abuse then becomes a strategic place to do work on, that then becomes a strategic generational place to do work on, because you can literally see how not just child sexual abuse, but intimate violence as well, but particularly child sexual abuse is passed down generation to generation. So strategically going for that hitting that mark, trying to intervene the cycle around child sexual abuse, which is often times the first place where people are being taught or learning about power and control, learning about oppression. We talk about it as the building blocks of oppression, and the building blocks of what normalizes violence later on, normalizes reproductive violence, [and] normalizes all kinds of other forms of violence. That is the first place where people are learning that consent doesn't exist and that their voice does not matter, and [where people are] learning shame about their bodies...all of these themes that reproductive justice really heavily hits on and should hit on in my opinion. Child sexual abuse is also a strategic place for organizing and for all of our movements, because it's not just about this secret thing that gets hidden that happens in people's home. The state uses child sexual abuse, whether it's rape as a weapon of war...we know a lot of those rapes happen to children and young women who are not full-grown women yet, and to boys and to people who are not boys or women, who are intersex whatever. We know that the sex work and the sex trafficking that happens around the militarization, and we know the long history of Native American boarding schools and child sexual abuse being used as a tool for colonization, like all of these things. The State obviously doesn't have...if it's using child sexual abuse, it doesn't have a vested interest in ending it. So I feel like my CSA work actually is a lot about reproductive justice and I bring a lot of my reproductive justice work with me, because I just think they're just so deeply tied, and there's no way...it's impossible to separate intimate violence, and particularly sexual violence, from reproductive justice anyways. But yeah, that's the work that I do now and I feel like that's where my heart really is, because I haven't come across a community where child sexual abuse doesn't exist, and certainly within Asian women communities, people don't talk about child sexual abuse. And yet I meet so many Asian women survivors of CSA all the time, who come up to me after I've spoken somewhere or after they read about my work. They don't have anywhere to go. There's no services. Because even those larger services that we were talking about, in that survivor realm, I mean a lot of women of color don't even access those services because of the silence and the added targeting that you're putting your community at risk and your self at risk for, if you come out as a survivor. There's so many pieces to why I feel really passionate around my CSA work, and then the transformative justice piece of it, I feel is just exactly right on the money, because so many of our folks don't report it and don't' seek services because they are scared of what the state will do. They are scared of deportation, they are scare of people being harassed and beaten again or locked up and taken to prison, or because they can't call the cops cause the last time the cops came to their house, they ended up raping them. There's so many things, so it feels like a really natural progression in my mind. I hope that it makes sense in other people's minds.\",\n",

       "  '”Out of the five or six years of working on this Vincent Chin case, we also were building a movement, an Anti-Asian violence movement, and organizations sprang up elsewhere in New York, in Boston. There\\'s a national group in Washington, L.A., San Francisco, and Washington...state of Washington. So there were all these different advocacy groups...Texas...where people ...Ohio...they were just groups that wanted to do something, and we began tracking. So we began tracking incidents of Anti-Asian violence and so things would come up, and they were various cases that were reported. Terrible cases of teenagers who were stabbed to death, five second graders in Stockton, California who were gunned down in their school playground by a white supremacist, cases that would come up all that time. And we started tracking them because there was no...there was nobody else doing it, so we started doing it. I got to the point where I probably had a list of fifty or a hundred, and it spanned every ethnicity; nobody was free of the violence. So this was the 80s, in the 1980s there were...I could recite them by [heart]. I mean, I would talk about them. I knew every word of them. And at a certain point, where I would talk about them... And every one of these were men. We have 50 or 100 names of incidents we\\'re tracking. What did that mean? Why are they all men? Why are they all male...except for the five children. I think there were some girls in there. But ones where they were specifically targeted to be bludgeoned to death or something. Most of the cases were men, and we knew their names. And so out of that there were other women, especially here in San Francisco, who was doing work around violence against women. And we asked, Why is it that the hate crimes are towards men?

You'll bring trouble to yourself and to your family. And you know, that's not really the way it works. It's really the more you speak up, the more possibility [you have] for making a difference, for making a change, instead of suffering in silence. It's the only way...especially in a democracy...it's the only way to improve conditions in your community, to make it better. Because if you're silent, people take that as a...It's just like it's in the Vincent Chin case. If we were silent, people would assume that it's because we had no problem with it. If you're silent, it's like the campaign in the beginning against homophobia with HIV and AIDS. Silence equals death. Silence equals death in the LGBT movement, but it also means death to our communities. If we're silent, it's okay for people to kills us. If we're silent, it's okay for kids to get bullied in school, Asian kids, because they're...or Asian American women to be targets of sexual harassment or sexual violence, because we're perceived as being passive and not fighting back. I mean, all of those things are...We have to speak up. Nothing gets done unless you speak up, whether it's in America or anywhere else.

       "  \". So dealing with immigration for Asian Americans has a lot of layers to it. So I think this is big, and as far as the visibility, what it means is, for Asian Americans, we have to make sure we're seen. We have to make sure we're heard. We have to talk about it. We have to talk about what it means for Asian American women and bring gender into this, too, because this last wave of migration, worldwide migration of people who have been displaced, was largely a female migration. Women who were dispossessed. And that brings a whole other layer of vulnerability that women have to violence, to less power, to sexual violence, to the need to care for children and parents and because women as caregivers in society, too. So anyway, I would say that that is for now, a huge one.\",\n",

And she was fine, we talked about it and then something happened and the plane was delayed and we had to land somewhere else and we had to stay over. And you know, I just ... my maternal instincts said, do you want to get a hotel room together, it would be cheaper and whatever, and I could tell she got really uncomfortable and then when we got off the plane, I saw her like rush to a pay phone and I thought, oh my god is she turning me in? Does she think I'm a child molester? I mean, I could be making all this up but I got really scared that I had done something incredibly stupid without meaning to. So that was a lesson to just kind of like ...

Now, I haven\\'t heard that in a thousand years, and it is possible that men have become re-educated, but at that time in Washington, it was an epidemic. So women were talking to each other about you know, we\\'ve got to do something, we can\\'t take it anymore, we\\'re going crazy here. So women were training themselves and each other to confront these, these guys. And what you were supposed to do was turn and say, \"Excuse me, I live in this neighborhood, and my name is Carol. Now, we have not been formally introduced, but if you want to talk to me in the future, just say \"˜excuse me, Carol,\\' or \"˜excuse me, ma\\'am.\\'\"\\x9d And the other thing was, \"Excuse me, women don\\'t like being talked to like that.\"\\x9d So, I did a couple of those. I did, actually, both of those. And each time, I got an apology, or I got a, woah, woah, I didn\\'t mean all that, I didn\\'t mean all that, I\\'m sorry, you know. Because the psychology was, these are men who are so accustomed to that privilege, they don\\'t expect communication with you. They don\\'t really want it. They want that vicarious thrill of you walking by. They want ...... they want the fake idea of power, do you know what I mean? The assumed, diluted experience of power. And the minute you turn and face them, you snap that delusion, you know, and they don\\'t know what to do. And that\\'s exactly what happened. Women all over D.C. were doing it, and talking to each other about it, and then it stopped. I was like, is it just that those men don\\'t see me anymore, or has it really stopped? And so I don\\'t know, I\\'d be very interested, at least in Washington, to do some sort of survey about how that goes these days, but I was getting ready to hit somebody, and I was getting ready to get killed, because ...... and you know, the average man that was psst psst at me was pretty big, and I probably, if he really was whacked, you know, I\\'d probably ...... would be very seriously harmed.

I had a minor nervous breakdown after that, I had a ...... oh my god, I thought I was seeing spiders on the wall. I didn't do psychedelics ever in my life. I was in a bar just trying to hang out and dance and all of a sudden I thought I saw spiders crawling on the wall, and I was starting to hallucinate, and it was all part of my post-traumatic stress.

They turned against me, and I had suffered at the hands of an attempted gang rape, kidnapping, when I was kidnapped at gunpoint, and being set up to look like a narc in my community, and it worked.

       "  'POLLET: So, one overtly political thing ...... and, mind you, I\\'ve always put my politics into my music. Basically, I write political songs and love songs. I don\\'t know how to do much else, so ...... ah, every now and then I write a funny song, but Ã¢\\n€Â“... so I wrote this song called \"Take Back the Night.\"\\x9d And the Take Back the Night march had asked me to be one of the performers, and it was the first Take Back the Night march, so I though, Ok, well then, I need to write a song called \"Take Back the Night.\"\\x9d So I wrote a song, and it starts out a capella. The lyrics go, \"Time\\'s ain\\'t like they was before / when night comes knockin\\' on my door / I\\'d go among the trees / to feel what\\'s dark and heavenly. / No, time\\'s ain\\'t like they was before / when night come knockin\\' on my door.\"\\x9d And then it goes, \"No man shall beat his wife on Sundays / or with a stick larger than his thumb. / Napoleonic code says women should be beaten every day like walnut trees. / Women were owned, bought\"\\x9d ...... oh, I forgot the other line ...... \"Women were owned, bought, enslaved, and slaughtered. / Our feet were bound, we bound our daughters. / No more will we deny / no more will we be in conspiracy\"\\x9d ...... and there\\'s a lot more lyrics to it, that I don\\'t remember all, but then it goes, \"We\\'ve got to say that it is men who violate\"\\x9d ...... terrorize and violate, or something like that. \"We\\'ve got to say, we\\'ve go to say it\\'s men. / Men abuse us, terrify us, drowned us at birth, burn us alive, rape and beat us, and they keep us, yeah, they keep us terrorized. / Can you remember ever feeling safe? / Do you remember only feeling scared? / Yes, we\\'ve got to, yes, we\\'ve got to / take back the night.\"\\x9d And then, towards the end, it says, \"It may not be all men, but you can bet, / it\\'s always men who own the night. / When you go home tonight, / some man may try to take your life / and you\\'ll have to fight.\"\\x9d And it repeats the chorus. So, when I was in the Toshi Reagan band ...... Toshi Reagan and the Agitones ...... we did my songs and Toshi\\'s songs, and we did covers, and I presented this song as one that I would like us to do, and one of the band members refused to play it. And I will say this, Toshi did stick up for the song, and it wasn\\'t Toshi. Toshi did stick up for the song. The other band member said that she didn\\'t want to offend men, and she thought that the song would offend men. And I said, \"Well, ok, these are the men that rape and beat us, torture us, drown us alive, burn us. I don\\'t care about offending them,\"\\x9d you know. \"Well, all men don\\'t do that.\"\\x9d I said, \"And so, at the end of the song, I say, \"˜it may not be all men, but you can bet it\\'s always men who own the night.\\' I\\'ve taken care of those guys who might get their feelings hurt, alright?\"\\x9d And she\\'s like, \"I won\\'t do it,\"\\x9d you know. And Toshi was apologetic, she says, \"You know, I can\\'t force her to do the song.\"\\x9d',\n",
       "  \"Ok, and I've heard the thing ...... I mean, the response to that is that this is a person who feels they were born a person ...... born a woman in the wrong body, and so for them, they've always been a woman. And I think, well that's good. I mean, I have no argument with that, but your body was male, so you weren't a female-bodied born person. Then ...... and this is what really infuriates me, and so I am on my little podium ...... is to insist that a woman is something other than what I think a woman is. And there again, I've got men telling me that they know what a woman is, like ...... I was born with a woman's body, and I have a woman's being in me, that also has it's like levels of, you know, maleness, and I have testosterone inside me and everything, but I'm a woman, it's that simple. And look, maybe in some other lifetime, I was a man, but one lifetime at a time ...... I'm a woman, ok, so, it's real simple: at a womyn born womyn's festival, that's what I want with me there. And little men boys can go ...... little boy men can go, you know. And, so to tell me that my experience of being a woman is the same as your experience of being a woman, when you were born in a male body, to me is absolutely crazy, you know, and that's a part of what's going on in this dialogue. And I think that's another rape of women ...... it just is crazy to me. The way I think of it is: you, in your male body, with your idea of you are a woman ...... love that, do what you need to do if you need a sex trans operation, and then live as a woman, and love yourself, and live that way, and be that way, and know that when there's a womyn born womyn's festival ...... which means you were born in a female body as a woman ...... that, basically, you're not welcome there. And go be welcome in all the other places you can go, because there's plenty of other women's festivals who welcome you. And Michigan's the only one that doesn't.

They wished that we could have just put it away in a room somewhere. They weren\\'t saying that we shouldn\\'t put it up at all but \"Can\\'t you put it somewhere more discreet?\"\\x9d To us it felt very much like ... and the idea behind the Clothesline Project is that whole notion of \"Don\\'t air your dirty laundry.\"\\x9d Don\\'t talk about sexual violence in public because it\\'s not polite and it makes people uncomfortable. And so that\\'s the whole point of the Clothesline Project is to be out and in public and to be visible. And so it was difficult to respond to because it was coming from a fellow survivor. There was compassion and we had done everything that we thought that we could do. We had a table that was always staffed right out in the Clothesline Project. We had counselors on-call at the medical center. We had set up a little safe space/decompressing space/processing space either in Seelye or the library. I don\\'t remember. So we had done everything that we thought we could do to support survivors in putting this thing up in public but it still created this huge backlash from this person and then from other non-survivors who also just didn\\'t want to deal with the fact that sexual violence happens, who didn\\'t want it to be in such a public space. So as the Board of AWARE we wrote an editorial to the Sophian in response and also put something up on the Daily Jolt which was then just trolled again because that\\'s what happens. But we did also send that to the Sophian and it was published in the newspaper. And then somebody also got upset because the ... I think this might have been my junior year or my senior year. They blur together ... but we had done a speak-out on one of the nights of Sexual Assault Awareness week and we had a speak-out on the steps of the campus center. We had amplified sounds. We had a little microphone bullhorn thing and people telling their stories. You could kind of hear it a little bit on the other side of Chapin lawn but for the most part you could only really hear it in that one space. And so we had gotten critiqued for that as well because somebody was, like, \"I was just on my way back home and there I was listening to somebody\\'s rape story and I didn\\'t ask for that.\"\\x9d And I was, like, \"Cool. None of us asked to be violated either.\"\\x9d It created this weird schism of everybody trying to support survivors in different ways but clashing in really painful and really difficult ways. Somebody who was not a survivor who was trying to speak for all the survivors in her life wrote another editorial to the Sophian. It was basically a battle of editorials citing super antifeminist scholars about how we were inflating the statistics of sexual violence anyway and not that many people are really victims and survivors. Saying that we were exaggerating it and that we shouldn\\'t be so public about it basically. And that Spring Dorothy Allison, who is an incredible feminist writer, came to campus and we ended up talking to her about it and she read both of them and was totally on our side. But it was a really difficult conversation to navigate because as AWARE we were also really protective of what we were doing and really defensive of the ways that we were going about bringing light to this issue of sexual violence. I think this is one of the down sides of being on a women\\'s college campus. People think that it just doesn\\'t happen here. The rates are lower, yes, but it does still happen and it\\'s not just UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amhers] kids coming over and committing sexual violence. It\\'s people on campus, too. The feminist dialogue on campus became really contentious for a little bit. And then, as things happen at Smith, it blew over eventually within a week and people were talking about other things. That one week we spent a lot of hours in my friend Cara\\'s room in Park House just writing and rewriting and rewriting letters and public statements and things that we could say and do to try to mitigate what was happening.',\n",

The party line of the college at the time was that there was no rape on campus or there was no sexual violence here, which, based on my own experience, and that of my friends, I knew was complete bullshit. So there was some ... sorry ... agitation about improving campus security. And they did make some changes, like put up ... we had blue boxes. You know, every half-mile, there was a blue box, just in case when you got attacked, you were right next to a blue box. But I think that was about it. I can\\'t remember anything else, at the time. GOLDMAN: If you don\\'t mind me asking, like, what ... how ... what was the student perspective, or ... with you, between you and your friends, and, like, noticing that the administration was maybe denying the fact that there was (inaudible) ... MCNULTY: We didn\\'t talk about it very much. There was a lot of what has since been labeled date rape going on. Just really ugly stuff. Now, maybe, because when I was in college here, the drinking age was eighteen. So you\\'d have college boys ... young men ... coming in for the house parties. And there was just no control over drinking, at all. Everybody was of age, but there were no drink limits, no drink tickets. It was just a beer bathtub; everyone just completely getting drunk. And so, there were a lot of unpleasant situations at best, and I think a lot of what we would call now rape situations. And I know I came home one night from a party in the quad, and a group of very drunk men followed me. And I had made one of them angry at a dance, because I refused to dance with him. I said I\\'d rather dance with my girlfriends. And I was probably not very nice when I said it. And they followed me home, and they tried to follow me into the house and attack me. And it was only because one of them ... I don\\'t know who it was, but he reached out, and he pulled the door closed, so they were all outside, and I was locked inside. But that was not uncommon. GOLDMAN: And the administration... MCNULTY: I did call security, but not till the next morning. I was so scared, I spent part of the night ... we used to have phone booths on the first floor of the houses, so I just huddled down in the phone booth. And I called my aunt and uncle, who lived in New Haven, and said, \"Can I come see you right away?\"\\x9d So I left campus. And then I notified security, and of course, what are they going to do at that point? They were long gone. And they were very ... security was nice; sympathetic. But they couldn\\'t do anything at that point. But I don\\'t think I told anybody that happened. I was ashamed of myself. Why? I don\\'t know. GOLDMAN: Not an uncommon [feeling?]. MCNULTY: No, it\\'s not. I understand that. GOLDMAN: Yeah. Yeah, so the administration hadn\\'t set up any... MCNULTY: No. GOLDMAN: ...ways of dealing with that?

       "  \"ASETOYER: Getting Indian Health Service to adopt a standardized set of policies and protocols for sexual assault victims for their emergency rooms. Native women are raped and sexually assaulted 3.5 times higher than any other race in the United States. That, to me, says priority issue. Yet the agency that is responsible for providing our health service has not even made that a priority by having a standardized set of policies and procedures for when a woman is brought into the emergency room. And that's not acceptable. What it means is that sometimes a woman will come into an emergency room and there's nobody trained to collect the forensic evidence, to do a rape kit. That service is contracted out and she may have to be transported or drive herself 50, 75, a hundred miles to a facility that has those services. And so, it means that there is a lack of evidence collected, because a lot of times a woman will not do that. They will go home, they'll take a shower, they'll start the process of healing, of dealing with what just happened. And so, it means that no forensic evidence is collected, so that there is no possible conviction that can occur. There is a predator that is out in the community to strike again. It means that no emergency contraceptive was offered. It means that later on down the line, if a pregnancy occurred, that under the constraints of the Hyde Amendment, because it was not reported to law enforcement, because there was no forensic exam done, that she wouldn't be eligible for an abortion. It means that she [would] not get the medication administered to her or even offered to her that would reduce her risk of contracting HIV, you know, or another sexually transmitted disease that could've occurred, so no treatment. So there are so many issues that are connected, and that are so important for a woman's health and reproductive health, that occur when she has been sexually assaulted, and these services need to be accessible. They need to be up to par. They need to be standardized, so that every woman that is brought in, or child that is brought into an emergency room within the Indian Health Service structure or system, receives the standard of care that will protect her and serve her needs ... a standard of care that a white woman would get in Beverly Hills or San Francisco or any other community. And not be victimized, or not treated as though it's a minimal occurrence, because that challenges who we are, and certainly is not, right now, a priority among Indian Health Service. So we're moving that whole issue forward through a coalition of women, not only mainstream organizations.\",\n",
       "  \"ASETOYER: No. Well, it depends on your definition of self-help. You know, there are forms that we use. We use talking circles. We use healing ceremonies, and that is a traditional forum that people can disclose, that people can start that process of healing. So, I wouldn't call it self-help. It's very different than the kinds of situations I've been in where people have called [it] self-help. In fact, you know, we think of self-help like self-exam, you know, more along those ways. And I know there are some groups that do what they call Self-Help, and that is even very different for us and very uncomfortable in a lot of settings. But we have certain ways of coming together and everything is started out with a prayer and a sharing of medicine through the process of smudging. Then talking circle, and that's a very different process. There are ceremonies that occur, that people can have, so that that process also takes place, of healing. And it's not something that's done one time. I mean, it's ongoing. It takes a lifetime, you know, of somebody working when they have been traumatized by that, by sexual assault. It takes a long time to heal, to start that process, to move forward with it, because it is so traumatizing. And we have to be careful that when we go into a community and talk about it, that we don't just pack up and leave, because for somebody who has been suppressing those feelings and those memories for long, to open them up, and then not provide any of the support that is necessary for that person, it's very unfair. It's just like, you know, opening up a flood gate and no control. And so, it has to be very well planned. There has to be certain support systems in place, so that the aftercare is there.\",\n",
       "  \"ASETOYER: Very much so. For instance, we're in the process of one right now. We put out this report on the sexual assault policies and protocols within Indian Health Service emergency rooms. And we did a survey of emergency rooms to look at the kinds of policies and procedures that take place. And we found out a whole lot, you know, and it wasn't good. So the next thing, after we put out that initial report on the results of our survey, is to convene a roundtable, because what happens in a roundtable is that we bring in the voices of the women from the communities and they share their realities. So that that initial report isn't just statistics. It is the voices of the women coming into the room and expressing what's actually ... what does it mean? What is this group of numbers: what does it mean? What does it mean when we say Indian Health Services does not have appropriate policies and procedures in their emergency rooms when a woman is sexually assaulted? What is the reality? So they share their stories and their realities. And we get a cross section of Native women to come in from many different tribes. And before you know it, they have confirmed that report ... their voice has. So then, we look at, What is the next step? So a group of recommendations will come out of that roundtable. And that gives us a work plan for the next few years. How are we going to resolve this problem? What are we going to do to address it? Are there policies, procedures, campaigns on education that need to be done? So this roundtable, actually, is the women coming together to say, We need to do this. This is our solution. These are our recommendations. This is how we can handle this. This is how we can work on solving some of these issues that we came here to talk about.\",\n",
       "  \"ASETOYER: Well, that's very heavy on your shoulders. It's always there. We have to look at what our families went through in that colonization process. We have to look at what our mothers and our fathers went through, what our grandparents went through, what our great-grandparents went through ... and prior to that, before a reservation, all the wars, all the violence, and the famine and the relocation. You know, we have to look at all of those things and how that impacts our community and our lives today. In boarding schools, there was a horrendous amount of corporal punishment that took place, as well as sexual abuse. Our mothers, our fathers, were raped, were sodomized, were violated by the priests within the Catholic Church. And prior to contact with boarding school experience, sexual abuse was unheard of on children. It was unheard of in our culture ... not to say that it did not exist, but from all the questions and research that we have done and all the interviews, that on the very rare occasion when something like that would surface, it was dealt with harshly. Abandonment, you know ... you were abandoned by the tribe. You were set outside the camp to survive on your own and that's it. You were disappeared. It was dealt with very harshly. The impact and the volume of sexual assault that occurred and sexual abuse that occurred in the boarding schools, you know, the rapes and the molestations, have had a horrendous impact on our culture. And the appropriate resources have not been provided for us to deal with it appropriately by the Indian Health Service or Health and Human Services. So, what we're doing is, we're, in our communities, starting the healing process, the dialogue, because of the impact, generation after generation, that this has had on our people. And it's very important to start that process of dialogue, to start the process of ceremony, to start the process of healing and to engage in that, because Indian Health Service, for the magnitude of the problem, is virtually doing nothing. And that, to me, is a continuation by omission, by omitting their responsibility, of the colonization process and the genocide and the ethnocide. And so, they're very guilty of that.\",\n",

To me, that presented a big contradiction in that faith, in the whole doctrine of the Catholic Church, because of all the sexual abuse and the corporal punishment and so forth that took place. And so I had no use for the Catholic Church. And when I was old enough to figure things out and understand the politics there and the history, and had seen the impact that it had on my mother, I didn't want anything to do with Catholic Church, and still don't to this day.

Or women who are survivors of cancer are the women who have started the major cancer movements in this country, and so forth.

But we still don't have ... at least from a U.S. standpoint. Internationally we have a lot more data to actually quantify, you know, the impacts of HIV and violence on each other, the bicausal effect, the bidirectional effects. We have less data inside the United States. But what we do know is that for women who are in violent situations or even abusive relationships ... so there may not even be physical or sexual violence happening yet, but even if there's emotional and mental abuse going on, is that the diminishing of their own sense of power and capacity to effect change in their own relationships will also diminish their opportunity to negotiate safer sex, to get tested, to know their status, or to disclose their status once they're aware. If they are HIV-positive around disclosing their status, that means that they are less likely to engage in accessing health care. They're less likely to ask for help or be seen asking for help. And so the presence of violence actually disempowers a woman to do anything about HIV that she thinks might be her right or the right thing to do to protect herself. And from the other standpoint, because of the stigma and the discrimination associated with HIV and AIDS, for a woman who is positive, she has an increased risk of violence in a lot of ways, and the notion of ... if we talk about structural violence, that the criminalization of HIV has actually been increasing. So knowingly having HIV, or not knowing her status and putting other people at risk ... that's a constant burden that a woman or people with HIV walk with. And that increases violence if someone finds out and has not been informed about that HIV status. The fact that in relationships where most times ... most times ... women are monogamous. And partners, male partners, are more than likely not, especially those who are violent, may ... are more than likely are not monogamous, right? So you have women in monogamous situations who think they're in monogamous relationships and are not, with men who are in denial about the risks that they're bringing home to their family. So a woman who ends up HIV ... and this has happened over and over ... who confronts a partner about their HIV status ends up being battered, brutalized, or even killed because their partner is in such denial that they blame the wife or their female partner for that.\",\n",

How much trauma are we already surviving as women based on some of the other social injustices that happen to us? Rape, incest, child molestation, just neglect, being treated differently because of skin color in the family. I mean, all of these are critical issues for women of color that play into not only the decisions we make in terms of HIV but what might happen or us or what might not be available to us because of all of those other conditions.

It was a national conference It was like Native women who were doing battered work up in Minneapolis showed up. We had the Asian sisters meeting in Chinatown. It was also the idea that people needed to meet autonomously and then come together. So black women were in Harlem, you know. We, Latinas met in the Lower East Side. And it's like everybody had a spot. Then we all came together. I'd yet to see that kind of organizing going on. So the whole notion of autonomous women of color organizing was just starting. And one of the reasons I started to work at the Rape Crisis Center is I felt like I didn't have enough non-cultural organizing experience of just doing grassroots organizing, basic organizing. I felt like I had always been dealing sort of with culture, you know, which is a form of work, but I wanted to really see what my worth was in terms of just being able to really, to run an organization or to actualize an organization and how women of color operated in it.\",\n",

       "  \"TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, housing work. I first got into the housing work while I was at the Crisis Center. I mean, I had done a little stuff before, but that was just around in the neighborhood and that just had to do with people maybe knowing what their rights were or, you know, helping somebody who was dealing with a slum lord, and that was to save the people. There was no movement and there was no focus on housing or anything like that. But when I was at the Center, I met this woman named Emma D'Angelo, Puerto Rican sister named Emma D'Angelo, who was working at the Center, and she was doing housing work. She was real interested in doing housing work. And I had some, you know, but we had been working on that survey in neighborhoods, like the safety of neighborhoods, the attitudes about it, so I had come to be able to see more safety issues around housing and stuff like that. But Ami had asked me to go to a ... I think she asked me to go to a tenant meeting with her, yeah. Because also, two other women, Maureen and BJ, were working on housing at the Center, on the neighborhood stuff around housing, and so from that, they had somehow, they had also gotten into using that as a way for the people to help organize tenants, just safety issues so they don't get raped and stuff like that.\",\n",
       "  \"But around '85 and '86, the connections begin to be disconnected. Stay in your area, you know, this is rape, you know, this is to provide education for the children, talk to people about incest, have incest-survivor groups, have rape-support groups. What does that have to do with the rape of women in Haiti? We're in Washington, D.C. We're in the United States. What does that have to do with the worker rights of women employees who clean buildings? I mean, connections were no longer made. They were not being encouraged. In fact, they were basically discouraged.\",\n",
       "  \"First of all I would say, to me at this point in my life, 2005, age 54, age 54, that I think that on certain levels, feminism is an ideal. It's an idea and it's an ideal. It's an ideal in terms of what a woman might be aspiring to. She's aspiring to be a feminist. She's aspiring to exist within a feminist world, a feminist reality. It is, um, ideas in regard to what kinds of freedoms, opportunities, how that woman is going to be able to live, what's available to her, you know, what she can access and in what ways, how she's seen and viewed in society, and how that view affects really all aspects of your life and your being. So you are striving for that ever so-called thing freedom. You want to be free as a woman, free as a human being, you want to have no limitations on you as a woman in regard to what you can do, what you can do. You don't want to have limitations on you in terms of what your rights are within the society, how you are viewed, OK. So then from there, it's like, but in reality, this is an ideal because we don't have these things, and these are things that we are struggling for in real basic ways, from how my body is being dealt with, how I have control or lack of control over my body, to what kind of contracts, et cetera, I can enter into without having to have a male force there guarantee whatever the particular situation calls for, to how I am perceived and used in that society in regard to things like conflict and aggression in places where women get caught in the middle, as in rape as a weapon of war. All of these different things are things that women are struggling and endeavoring to change, to bring about the justice in that area, the fairness, the equality in those areas.\",\n",
       "  \"I started formally working at the Rape Crisis Center, I believe it was something like October of 1974, because Kianga was born in March of '75, yeah, so it must have been ... make sure I don't have my child's dates wrong ... yeah, I think it was October of\\n1974 that I began working at the Rape Crisis Center. And at first, I was just sort of doing all kinds of things, you know, doing a little hotline stuff, a little community education stuff. It wasn't all ... and really, I think they were sort of preparing me for Nancy's job, the general administrator, because she was going to leave, and after she left, I became general administrator. ROSS: OK. What was going on in your thinking about black women and the women's movement at the time? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, child, a lot of things. First of all, I mean, I was very passionate about the issue of rape and sexual assault and women being helped. I was very disturbed by what seemed to me to be the lack of a presence of black women and women of color in the movement. But certainly many of our clients were black women. So what was going on in my mind was one, how to serve women and two, how to get more women of color involved in the Rape Crisis Center and get the Rape Crisis Center more connected with the community, beyond what it was. It was also, initially, in the beginning, it was a learning time for me, you know, to learn exactly what is feminism. You know, how do people define feminism? What is the scope of feminism under that definition? Learning more about pornography, because I'd never really thought about pornography ... you know, nasty men read pornography at night when nobody's looking, or something. I mean, in terms of thinking of it as an industry that disempowered women or, you know, devalued or objectified, all of that. Those were not really words in my vocabulary or concepts, you know. So my first months at the Rape Crisis Center, first year, was a learning process for me, too. Learning more about feminist thinking and what the issues and the politics of it was. And always trying to see how it fit and integrated in my community, because I certainly saw the urge to try to make people split and choose. If you're black, you can't be a feminist. If you're a feminist, you're not black. If you're for the women's struggle, then you can't be for the people's struggle. If you're for the people's struggle, then how can you isolate out just the women. All that craziness, you know, just trying to navigate my way through it, figure out what the heck was going on. ROSS: Name some of the black feminists who may have influenced your thinking, you may have encountered in the mid-70s. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh. I mean, certainly people who I was reading, that came more toward, I guess ... I'm trying to think. When did I first read something from bell hooks and something from Audre Lorde? I don't think that I knew a lot of black women, because I hadn't really ... in the rape crisis movement at that time, hadn't really come across, you know, hardly any other black women. I mean, I knew about New York Women Against Rape and so I knew some of them had to be something, somebody had to be black or Puerto Rican or something like that. But I didn't really know a whole lot about who the women were. Of course, I mean, I heard of like the star feminists at the time, you know, Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan and, um, Bella Abzug and Flo Kennedy, you know, I'd heard of, but I didn't really know a lot about that. ROSS: So at the time, we're talking about '74, '75, '76, what was the Rape Crisis Center doing vis-Ãƒ -vis black women in terms of outreach to or work with or ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Talking about it. Even though they always made a concerted effort to bring black women onto the staff, they really felt that going into the schools or education should be a black woman, because that's mainly who was going to be in those schools, that that was in the staff, there should be black women. There was really a problem recruiting. There seemed to be a problem to recruit black people onto the board of directors, you know, who came or who actually stayed. So for the most part, most of the time, for a really long time, the board was always ... basically, it was white, as was, now, in '76, when we went with CETA and VISTA, you know, and CETA was the concentrated employment program [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act], so that brought us quite a few women of color, and then VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, that brought us ... so that was the time when we had the largest women-of-color staff. We had Latino women, because we wanted to do work in Addams, which was a predominantly Latino community, to assess the attitudes about rape and what kind of services and what people did there, and the same in the black community. So, we had, like, three or four Latino sisters and about six black women that came on specifically through CETA and VISTA. I think the main way that the Rape Crisis Center at the time was reaching the black community was through the services provided for clients. They were just always aware that they were very lacking and very short in terms of the relationships and the networks et cetera to be a crisis center in the District of Columbia.\",\n",
       "  'One of the reasons that I made a conscious choice to go ahead and deal with the Black United Front was because what I had found, was that in the time I had worked at the Rape Crisis Center, I had really developed some negative feelings about men, and I found it kind of coloring my attitudes, you know, because I had so much rape and so much pornography and domestic violence, and harassment, you know. It was, like, put them all in a plane and send them somewhere by themselves, you know.',\n",
       "  \"So I was very much centered in, staying in, things that had to do with women and children. At the same time, I was moving more into, within the social service realm, in terms of nonprofit but in terms of funding and ways that people looked at things that were much more systematized and much closer to where politics began to get more and more vacuumed out of the conversation, you know, out of the programs, really, in many ways, out of the expression of the staff. The freedom to really hook the work aspects, the political aspects and the organizational and everything, as I did at the Rape Crisis Center, was not there. At the Rape Crisis Center, I practically did whatever it was I needed to do to advance the work of women, to advance the work of the Center, period, you know. So it didn't have restrictions on being able to go to this conference or work in coalition with this group or do this or do that.\",\n",
       "  \"So that is how ... that is who Michelle was. She was the community education coordinator. She did a lot of the work of creating the first materials that were used for education and her job was to go out in the D.C. public schools and do presentations on rape and prevention, and that is what she did. ROSS: Did she go on to become the director? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No. She did not. Michelle actually left the Rape Crisis Center and she went to My Sister's Place and became the director at My Sister's Place, which was a shelter for battered women and their children.\",\n",
       "  'TOURÃƒÂ‰: I did do a lot of things at the Rape Crisis Center, speaking with all humility and truth. Once I came back, I became the director for community education. That\\'s the job that I held. That\\'s the position that I held until I left. I brought Anti-Rape Week into the Rape Crisis Center, something I\\'m really proud of, because it exists today under a different name, but ... ROSS: What was Anti-Rape Week? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Anti-Rape Week was a massive education week where there were all kinds of workshops, seminars, film showings organized, and we advertised and people would come out to events. So it was to build education to raise prevention awareness, and to recruit people into an awareness of, and hopefully support for, the Crisis Center and to take a look at and become advocates for the issue of sexual assault, rape. So we did Anti-Rape Week, and then the women who were a part of FAAR, Feminists Against Pornography, if that was the right name, organized. The Rape Crisis Center had actually worked and organized the first Take Back the Night march in D.C., which I think was in 1978. I think it was in 1978. And then, the following year, I organized Anti-Rape Week. I don\\'t think we had a march that year. Then the following year is like when Feminists Against Pornography picked up and decided that that was going to be one of their major things that they would do every year was organize a Take Back The Night march and the Crisis Center would work with them, so we coordinated so that the Take Back the Night march became a part of Anti-Rape Week, either the beginning or the end, you know, a major activity. [As a member of Feminists Against Pornography, Marty Langlen, a white woman, was central to this organizing effort. She also became a member of the Rape Crisis Center board of directors. Another woman with Feminists Against Pornography who did a lot of work was Clarisse.] And Anti-Rape Week evolved into Rape Awareness Week, and then as the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault took up rape awareness, and ultimately had Rape Awareness Month, which the rape crisis centers across the country pretty much observed and organized for that in their communities. The hassle-free zone. There was a lot of street harassment going on in D.C. There was a sister named Linda Leaks, not was, she is, who was in school at the time and she was making a film on street harassment, and she was so impassioned about it ... ROSS: She is a black woman. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Linda Leaks is a black woman who was making a film on sexual harass[ment] ... street harassment, and Linda was so impassioned about it that she also created a t-shirt to stop violence against women, you know, verbal abuse of women. Well, at the time that she was doing that, dealing with the street harassment and kind of strategizing around how to combat it and how to respond to it, white women were also doing some organizing and they had come to the idea that they wanted to make Dupont Circle ... in D.C., Dupont Circle was, is an area that is sort of a hub area for the commercial district downtown and people come there and they eat lunch and walk through, and then, it\\'s part of the social life at night. So there\\'s a lot going on in Dupont Circle and around Dupont Circle. So you can get harassed walking through there or sitting in there and trying to eat your lunch, and all of that. So a group of white women had decided they wanted to be able to not be hassled in Dupont Circle, so they wanted that to be, you know ... My idea was that they could not take Dupont Circle and single out Dupont Circle as a place not to be harassed, that if we were going to try to have a campaign, we needed to wage a campaign to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. So that you would have the right, wherever you were, not to be \"Hey, baby, hey, mama,\"\\x9d all of that kind of nonsense ... \"What\\'s your sign? What\\'s your name?\"\\x9d ... all of that, that you wouldn\\'t have to deal with it. So, we [joined forces and] entered on a real struggle to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. We met with the police, you know, because we wanted to have penalties. We wanted to have it written in law somewhere, you know, penalties around this whole thing. And we worked on it for about two years, but we just couldn\\'t really make it happen. It was too big. But in the process, there was a lot of education. We used to have what were called speak-outs, and we\\'d just be different places, at a Metro stop on a Friday, in Dupont Circle on a Wednesday, maybe down at the Federal Triangle on a Monday, Easter Market, various places, to do rallies, where people would speak out about street harassment, sexual harassment on the streets, and we would make the interconnections between street harassment and pornography and rape, you know. And we did a lot of consciousness-raising and a lot of great organizing as a result of that in those two years that we worked on that. Also, doing the organizing of the Take Back the Night marches and the Anti-Rape Weeks that we did for a number of years, that is one of the ways that I was able to bring a lot of women of color into the Rape Crisis Center, that came to work and organize around these different issues for Anti-Rape Week. More women of color than the Rape Crisis Center had ever seen collectively in all the years prior to that. Women came in and it was a very exciting process. They volunteered to be on the hotlines and as a result ... and that was all, that was really good stuff. ROSS: Describe, if you don\\'t mind me backing up just a little bit, what was going on that caused the 1980 conference to happen, or am I going too far? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, no. You\\'re speaking about the first conference on Third World Women and Violence. It came about because there was that need to pull women of color together, to acknowledge that violence existed in our communities, to talk about the forms that it took, the kinds of responses that we got to it, the attitudes that existed there, and what needed to be done. It also came about because women of color who were doing this work desperately needed to know each other. We needed to network. We needed to build and consolidate a network. And so, though that conference brought about 80 women, you know, in total, however, they came from a lot of different places, and we were able to find out about, like Fatima Cortez, with that little rape crisis center up there in New Bedford or someplace in Massachusetts. We had the New York Women Against Rape come down, that\\'s when we had the great honor to meet and develop our first relationship with Sandra Comacho, Ch\\nrrÃƒÂ\\xade Moraga, and those women from New York. The women from Boston came, and so we first met ... not Barbara ... I\\'m trying to remember ... Barbara Bullette was there. It was the woman who was the therapist, Ruth something [Ruth Hall]. But a few women came from Boston. We all ... that was the start of the building and continuation of a network. Those were the first steps towards that. So that was really, that was really a great, a great conference. And it was really exciting. It was part of ... we made it a part of Anti-Rape Week and it was great, and it was where we got ... I believe it\\'s where we got our famous logo. ROSS: Tell me about that logo. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Our famous logo which represented ... the Rape Crisis Center had this beautiful logo that ironically, it was done for us by a brother named Malik Edwards, who used to be one of the artists for the Black Panther Party, who drew the pictures for the Panther Speaks newspaper, and we asked Malik if he would develop ... wait, let me back up for one second. I\\'m running two thoughts together. I\\'m running this thought ... no, I know what it is. The Shanti Dolls. I was getting ready to run it in with ICAW [International Council of African Women] and the Dolls that Beverly did for us. OK. Put that on the side. Malik, who had been in the Black Panther Party, we asked him if he would develop a logo for us for our conference, the Third World Women and Violence Conference, and he drew for us ... he came back with four fertility dolls, one looking Asian, one African born in America, one First Nation, and one Latina, and it was the details on the fertility dolls that determined the ethnicity of each of them. And so these four together represented women of color, and made an extremely powerful statement. So it became the logo for the Third World Women and Violence conference. And then our very next edition of the Rape Crisis Center publication that dealt with myths and facts about rape, we used that logo on it. And it was just ... what can I say? It was a success. Anyone whoever looked at it loved it. Of course, there did come a time, somewhere down the road, where there was conflict when someone said, \"There\\'s no white doll, you know, there\\'s only four, there should be five dolls.\"\\x9d Why? \"There\\'s no white woman.\"\\x9d Well, the logo didn\\'t change. It didn\\'t expand, you know, under the creator\\'s vision. That was his vision of what we had asked him to do for that conference, so that was that. So that is how the Third World Women and Violence ... it\\'s called the First National, because it actually was the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence, and we were honored to be the people to put out the call for that. [Deirdre Wright, who worked at the Rape Crisis Center at the time, was conference coordinator.]',\n",
       "  \"TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. As I recall, there was, in 1970 or '71, there was this big women's speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the women's movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillen's apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My Sister's Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power. All the things that everyone criticized women for having as part of an analysis of violence against women ... who now, the mainstream themselves, embrace a large part of that ideology or that perspective, that politic, or that analysis, however you want to say it, about that, that they didn't do before, Post Traumatic Stress [Disorder], you know, rape trauma syndrome, just any number of things that the women were saying in '72, '73, '74 went on for so long, that the more traditional society, law enforcement, medical, social, was rejecting all of that, have now had to come around and embrace it. And not just embrace it, but kind of like take it over and claim it, like this was their thinking, their theory, all along and all the time, which was just so outrageous, such revisionist history. In that house, in that apartment on Q Street, and it stayed there in Jackie's apartment for some time. And from Jackie's apartment, the first place it went was to that small, two-room across the street from Lincoln Junior High School on 16th and Irvin Street. ROSS: OK. There were some feminist magazines, and wasn't there a group called the D.C. Area Feminists Alliance? TOURÃƒÂ‰: FAAR. ROSS: Feminist [Alliance] Against Rape. Tell me about FAAR and ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, FAAR was ... some of the women in FAAR were from the Rape Crisis Center who had left the Rape Crisis Center, wanted to do something else or do some things differently, and so there were people who were interested in publishing, and they got interested because there was also a quarterly scholarly magazine called Quest. Quest preceded FAAR, you know, because it was more scholarly, a quarterly and all that. So you had women who worked on Quest who were interested in putting some focus around rape and so forth, and you had women who had been at the Rape Crisis Center who had an interest in putting out written materials and educating in that way, so they got FAAR magazine. The thing I'm trying to remember, because it had two incarnations, as FAAR and as Aegis magazine. And actually, what I think is that they became FAAR the collective. The magazine was Aegis magazine, and it carried articles and information on sexual assault and theory around sexual assault, you know, all kinds of tips, this, that, the other, different stuff, stories, articles that had to do with empowering women and all of that. Later, Aegis joined with ... oh, yes, and of course, dealing with pornography as well. Later, Aegis joined with domestic violence and half the magazine would deal with issues related to sexual assault, pornography, and the other half would deal with issues dealing with battering and domestic violence. ROSS: Did you get the sense that in the early years, the people at the Rape Crisis Center worked on other forms of violence that women experienced, or was it just gender-based violence? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It was gender-based violence. However, definitely gender based, although the Center did recognize that it was possible for a man to be raped, it was obviously not the primary focus, but there was certainly the acknowledgment that men could be sexually assaulted. You had individuals who worked at the enter who may have had involvement and ties into other movements around other issues, but the Crisis Center was strictly dealing with rape and had its hands full to deal with that, because in '72 and '75, I mean, the police, everybody, I mean, it was a battle. You know, if we ... it still continues to be a struggle, you know, but it was a battle. It was a war, you know, in terms of they didn't want you to have companions. I mean, all rape crisis centers, now you can have a companion with the woman at the hospital that's from the center. So, Oh, no, you couldn't do that. They didn't want you there because you impeded the investigation by being there. So then it was, like, the only way you could be there was if the woman requested that you be there. I mean, it was all these things, you know. Women asked for it. It was just horrendous. So they weren't just dealing ... they were not really making connections to anything else. They were dealing with the dynamics of gender, you know, and as time moves forward, began to ... around different issues, make connections, broaden out ... ROSS: OK. Now, you're saying that your working at the Rape Crisis Center affected your marriage. In what way did your consciousness that you developed at the Center cause you to re-look at your marriage? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It wasn't working at the Rape Crisis Center that caused me to ... I didn't need Rape Crisis Center. I mean, in all honesty, I didn't need the Rape Crisis Center to help me with that at all. When I was saying, working, I meant working in terms of the finances of it. You know, where if the man doesn't have a regular job or steady job and you do even just part-time, full-time, whatever it is, the dynamics that that creates. No, it wasn't a consciousness from the Rape Crisis Center. It was just the consciousness of, you got to go, because somebody's going to get hurt, OK. And so, I ain't fit for it to be me, so, and you're not leaving my child no place else, so you got to go\",\n",
       "  'TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, you know, we had the bookstore and I had Against Rape, and there was a book prior to Against Rape that was on the topic of rape. And in that area of Northeast, there had been a couple of assaults surrounding the neighborhood where we lived, or where the bookstore was, and we\\'d had a couple of meetings where women could come out and talk about it. ROSS: Who\\'s the \"we\"\\x9d? TOURÃƒÂ‰: We, meaning myself and a couple of other women were Save the People. ROSS: All black women? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: What year was this? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Seventy-four, late \\'73, maybe early \\'74. And as a result, I was on the radio one day, on WHUR, doing an interview and talking about rape and sexual assault, and some women at the Rape Crisis Center were listening to WHUR. Now that in itself is an intriguing mystery. ROSS: Why were these white women at the Rape Crisis Center listening to this black radio station at Howard University called WHUR? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes, it must have been because Michelle was there. So, anyway, yeah, because Michelle said she heard it, so they had WHUR on and they heard this interview, and they wanted to find ... Oh, there\\'s another black woman in D.C. talking about rape. We must find her. And I got a call from, I believe it was Deb Freidman at the bookstore, and asking me ... introducing herself, she was from the Rape Crisis Center, and asking if I would meet and talk with them about ... and I went and I admit, I was curious. I mean, the Rape Crisis Center. I was curious. I went. We talked. I met Michelle. Michelle asked me to go to American University with her and do a presentation. And that, sort of, was the genesis of the relationship with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. ROSS: So describe to me who Michelle Hudson was. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Michelle Hudson was the community education coordinator. She was black, she was the second ... the Rape Crisis Center started in 1972 and so, we are now up to \\'74, so it\\'s only been, like, two years. It\\'s very young. Nancy McDonald is the general administrator ... because we try not to be hierarchical, so we have don\\'t have an executive director, no executive director at that point in time ... the general administrator, who generally administrates. OK, so we had a general administrator, and the community education coordinator. And because Nancy, had ... I\\'m trying ... there was a reason, OK, the point was that the community education coordinator made more than the general administrator, because they based it around need and not just around title or hierarchy. So it was kind of collective sense of in the beginning, it was very interesting. This little tiny, two-room, upstairs, across from a junior high school, Lincoln Junior High School, up on 16th and Irvin Street. They were in a house across the street, upstairs. So that is how ... that is who Michelle was. She was the community education coordinator. She did a lot of the work of creating the first materials that were used for education and her job was to go out in the D.C. public schools and do presentations on rape and prevention, and that is what she did. ROSS: Did she go on to become the director? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No. She did not. Michelle actually left the Rape Crisis Center and she went to My Sister\\'s Place and became the director at My Sister\\'s Place, which was a shelter for battered women and their children.',\n",
       "  \"Wow. Well, first of all, I don't know if herstory can say it or history can say it or whatever. I know one thing is that in the 13 years that I worked at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, I served a lot of people and I helped a lot of people. And I still run into people sometimes who say, you know, I remember when you used to work at the Rape Crisis Center. You were my counselor. Or, You were the counselor for a friend of mine. Things like that. Because I counseled a lot of women when I worked at the Rape Crisis Center, and I feel good about that. Also doing the education in the schools, the program, I run into people who say, I remember when you came to my school. You came to Roosevelt. You came to Paul. You came to Hart. You came to Charles Drew. You came to my school. And that was really good. So I feel that I have touched a number of people's lives in a personal way that may not ever get broadcast, and sometimes I think about, What if I had not ever worked at the Rape Crisis Center? There would have been these people who wouldn't have got touched in that way that, you know, that you helped them to be able to heal theirselves and resolve their conflicts so their lives could be better. That's really good. Um, I think that the involvement of women of color at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, through the organizing for Anti-Rape Week and working with the people who organized the Take Back the Night marches and the very first Third World Women and Violence conference, national conference, held in this country, that though were only about 75 women or so that attended, it was a significant thing for the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence. I think that I played a significant role in helping to shape and develop a network and a movement of like-minded, feminist-minded, whatever, third world women and women of color in the metropolitan area in doing work in the area of violence against women, you know, kind of coming together to study and to expand around violence against women, because we were looking at sexual assault, domestic violence. We were looking at street harassment, you know, we actually tried to get D.C. declared a hassle-free zone, free of the hassle, sexual, verbal harassment and hassling of women. I worked on the interfamily bill to change the definition and way of dealing with domestic violence and battering, on the rape bill. Just the consciousness of women around being active in gender politics, helping to facilitate this idea that we had to end the silence in our communities, and I think that all of these third world women of color, African American women, women in the Latino community, and so forth and so on, but definitely in the black community, of pushing and making dialog happen in our communities around us when people didn't want to hear it, you know, and challenging people and their ideas about it. So I think, I believe I've made some contributions in that area, you know, maybe helping to extend how people look at violence against women, like [what] we did with the whole braid thing, when they were wanting to fire these women at the hotel because they were wearing their hair in cornrows, you know. And I said that that was a form of psychological violence against women, and even though I had to sort of struggle with the Rape Crisis Center, the Crisis Center was able to initiate and take the leadership to organize a major demonstration in front of the Marriott Hotel down on 14th Street, where we actually had the unions, a couple of the union locals involved, and had almost a thousand people out there in the streets, including Ras Michael out there in the streets to protest that.\",\n",
       "  \"we were together for seven years, from the time of being in the Party to the actual time of no longer being in the Party and [Save the People] and ending our relationship, was seven years, and it was just simply that I just simply could not deal with the drinking anymore, the kind of little disappearing acts, just all of it. And also, the issues that kind of go with ... when I started working at the Rape Crisis Center, you know, so one person is working in a job that's not a system job, but it's a job, OK, and you, the male, are not, OK. So then another whole set of dynamics went with that, and it was just ... it just took more energy than I could really deal with.\",\n",
       "  'But here in D.C., one of the larger churches and the minister was accused of sexual harassment. And there were four women, and they were really, really upset and traumatized. And they were directed to, not just the Rape Crisis Center, they were directed to me, to work with them and support them and sit in on some of their meetings and so forth and so on. And this guy was actually charged, you know, with sexual harassment. And in the church, he ultimately, even though it was kind of close, but he ultimately won. Oh, no, not ... you know. In the process, though, working with these women was just really ... it was horrendous. And because the case was in the newspaper and that sort of thing. I was getting criticized, you know, for bringing down a good man, for messing with somebody\\'s reputation or getting into the middle of something that wasn\\'t that serious. It\\'s not like he raped anybody, that sort of thing. And I can clearly remember one day, I was ... two particular occasions. One, there was a man and woman together somewhere up in Northwest, and he said, \"Aren\\'t you the woman at the Rape Crisis Center that\\'s working with the women?\"\\x9d \"Yes, I am.\"\\x9d \"How are you going to just tear a black man down?\"\\x9d Kind of went into this, right? And the woman, the sister who was with him, she kind of pulled him up, you know, she was kind of, like, Why don\\'t you leave her alone? She\\'s ... we\\'re out here doing, to go to the movies. Why are you doing this? kind of thing. Which was the first time that I sort of realized, my goodness, this is kind of bigger than I realized it was. And then, I was walking across Malcolm X Park, and this guy says, \"Aren\\'t you the woman who\\'s helping those women against John?\"\\x9d His first name was John, I cannot remember his last name. I could go back and look this stuff up because I know I have it somewhere. And I said, \"Yes.\"\\x9d And he said, \"Well, what\\'s wrong with you? Do you like men?\"\\x9d And I said, \"No.\"\\x9d And he said, \"Oh, because you\\'re a lesbian.\"\\x9d What I really meant was I don\\'t like men like you, you know, small-minded and aggressive and rude. So, he said, \"You\\'re a lesbian.\"\\x9d And so I just said something like, \"You\\'d better watch your girlfriend,\"\\x9d because he just pissed me off. I don\\'t know. But that was really stressful, and people at the Crisis Center really didn\\'t realize how significant this was that was going on. [The case of a woman suing a minister became a major polarizing issue in the black community.] Because this is, like, an out-in-the-open thing around sexual harassment, verbal sexual harassment stuff. You know, a little pat on the behind, this, that, and the other, that people had always known about in different places where they hadn\\'t come out like that ... ROSS: This was before Anita Hill. TOUR\\nƒÂ‰: Yes, oh, yes. You know, so this was kind of like, out there, so I had to put a lot of energy into it and it was very stressful.',\n",
       "  \"I had been thinking about this ... because I'm doing this work, because I'm organizing this program around rape as a weapon of war, it's got me thinking a number of things because of these places where these things intersect. We're talking about rape as a weapon of war, you're looking at all the various places where there is conflict in the world, on the globe, and what that means for women and children, and particularly, you know, what it means for women in these places of conflict and as it relates to globalization and imperialism and fascism, racism. It's very significant. We're in 2005, so we're at the beginning of the 21st century, and at the end of the 20th century, et cetera, so you've been looking at things like what happens with women in conflict, what happened with the women in Bosnia, Kosovo, what's happening in the Sudan, Congo, what happened with Rwanda, Haiti, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Nicaragua. Just sort of start naming places ... Korea, South Korea, Vietnam, the Civil War ... just start naming places, and see and look at the treatment of women and the treatment of children, you know. Why were they treated that way? They were treated that way because they were women. They were treated that way because, in society, all these societies where there's male chauvinism and gender male dominance exists, they're seen as property. So thus, they are used in that way as well to discourage a nation, to make men feel powerless because they were not able to protect part of their greatest treasures of things that they own, you know. That's where we get those sayings like, The hearts of people are not conquered until the hearts of its women are on the ground. That's where, you know, all these different ideas come from in terms of resistance to this, but you see and you know that it's true because, if not, why is it happening? When you talk about spoils of war, how is it that women, who are human beings, become a part of the spoils of war, do you know? That you demoralize a village by raping all the women in the village? That you have an idea that you can improve a race of people, lighten them up, make them more worthy, more acceptable by raping the women and having them rape ... like in the Sudan with the Geneina, where they're talking about, you know, You're too black and we need lighter people in the Sudan. You're black, you're ugly, you know. So you're systematically trying to genocide out a people and bring about a new people ... all of this through the wombs of women. I find this quite disturbing, quite terrifying, as a woman with a womb and a vagina. This kind of bothers me, you know. So you have all these places where these male-dominant attitudes prevail, not just on the level of conflict, but on the internal level within the society where these exist ... in places in Africa where people believe that if you rape a virgin, that it'll cure you of AIDS. It's like, whatever could you be saying? You know, it's this idea in India that if the woman does something she disgraces the whole family and she must be punished, so, you know, we can just set her on fire, because we have to avenge the honor of this family. What are you talking about? These kinds of conflicts that exist even on an internal level within the country, within the tribe, within the society, whatever, you know, women are the ones who are abused, the ones who are traded off and traded for. In a situation where a woman, her husband dies, in some societies where the husband dies so now the woman must marry again, and her family must find her a mate or the husband's brother must step forward and marry her. And all the property now becomes his, you know ... because she can't function on her own without her husband? She might be glad to have the first time to be able to roll without him. But here she is now being passed on. So she doesn't even count. It's her and her property gets taken over to this next person. All these kinds of situations, you know. So in that kind of an atmosphere, you're not necessarily ... not very likely there're going to be a lot of women's centers or battered women's shelters, rape crisis centers, you know, or even kind of support groups that are organizable in an informal way or organized in a more clandestine way, like the Jane Collective used to exist, you know, in different ways. So the idea of being able to have these women ... and then of course in some places, there are centers and there are things, and I guess a lot ... maybe they come out of areas where there are universities, where women have resources at the university level and where the women maybe have more education or something like that. But to be able to kind of work to bring some of that together, so people can create their own, in the way that it's going to work where they are, where they live ... to be able to do that, I think that would be a really good thing, interesting and exciting, whatever, very helpful, for sure. ROSS: So you see your future work helping women in other countries deal with the consequences of rape being used as a weapon of war? Taking your experiences from building the movement to end violence against women here and globalizing it from the perspective of women of color? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I see it as something to think about. I mean, the way you just articulated it, you made it sound so good. I mean, the way you articulated it, it sounded really, really, really good and it sounded really organized ... ROSS: Well, I don't want to put words in your mouth. I'm just trying ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, I'm saying, the way you said it, that's what it is, but I mean, I didn't say it like that. So I'm saying, you know, the way you said it, it sounds really good, the way you said it. It even sounds fundable, the way you said it.\",\n",
       "  \"TOURÃƒÂ‰: I left the Rape Crisis Center in August of 1988. To say burnt out is not adequate. It does not begin to describe ... I like to say I was nuked. I was nuked. I just could not ... it had been 13 years, and the last five years of that time had really been ... the last four years of it had really been a lot of battling. A lot of things had changed in the Crisis Center, in the women's movement, in the movement against violence against women. As organizations were striving for the dollars, for the funds, then out came the cry of professionalism. We must be professional. So the whole look and feel of the various centers and shelters began to change. The collective ... the idea of collective running and sharing of responsibilities and those sorts of things, were falling to the side, that seeming need to conform without seeing that at the time, the more we conform, the more we were required to conform, and the more we conformed, the more we were required to conform. And so, you had situations in some places where people who had previously been the executive directors were asked to step down because they were lesbian, they were too radical, they didn't fit the image for a professional. The boards of directors became more professional, and please understand me, there's nothing wrong with being [professional] organizers. It's a matter of what you define professionalism as being. When it becomes such that you are not just dealing with policy, but you are taking the policy in a direction that's basically the opposite of where it has been, or when you begin to micromanage staff, you begin to have problems. You have a lot of problems. ROSS: Would you define as being more or less feminist, the professionalism? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Less feminist. To me, less feminist. ROSS: Why? What would you define that? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I would say, because it became less political and more social-service oriented. You know, provide the services. And of course, there's got to be services. I mean, what's the ... you need a hotline. You need companions to go to the clinic or the hospital and be able to be there. You need the hospital to agree to allow you have a room there in the hospital where you all can function out of. But when, OK, during that time when more people and more ideas came into the Center -- you had asked the question earlier about making connections with other issues and other movements. That was a period of blossoming, when all that was the kind of ... those kinds of things were going on very strongly, like between '80 and '85, '86 [connections between community organizing, the involvement and leadership of women of color, links with other groups and issues]. But around '85 and '86, the connections begin to be disconnected. Stay in your area, you know, this is rape, you know, this is to provide education for the children, talk to people about incest, have incest-survivor groups, have rape-support groups. What does that have to do with the rape of women in Haiti? We're in Washington, D.C. We're in the United States. What does that have to do with the worker rights of women employees who clean buildings? I mean, connections were no longer made. They were not being encouraged. In fact, they were basically discouraged. They may not have been discouraged totally by saying, like, we're just not dealing with that. But if it doesn't get dealt with, if no one wants to talk about it, no one wants to plan around it, no one supports it, it's not getting dealt with. The connections are not getting made. And that was very much happening, that kind of moving away from making the interconnections. We are a service-oriented organization. We do education in the schools and we provide counseling. That's what we do, you know. And we go out and speak at the functions in the community, and raise the consciousness at other institutions, and when I'm saying raise the consciousness, what I actually mean is being made aware of the issues around sexual assault and how to deal with them. And that was pretty much becoming it. So, between board micro-management, not continuing to forge out and make those connections, losing many of the women of color because the issues that would keep the connections were not there, so we were coming to a place of ideological differences and being totally burnt out, because I worked like a Mississippi slave in a cotton field in those years when I worked at the Rape Crisis Center, that I served my community. I was just nuked. I just couldn't ... it was time for me to go.\",\n",
       "  \"just in the community in general, if I was working with people maybe around issues, something that had to do maybe with, if it had to do with housing, if it had to do with neighborhood safety, whatever it was, however it was that something came up dealing with women, it always kind of came up with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. That's the feminists. That's that women's movement. What are you for, you know, are you for the black movement? Are you for the women's movement? Are you for the people or are you for the women?\",\n",
       "  'My sexual formative experiences were not all that great, because I was raped, and when I was raped I was a virgin, so that didn\\'t put me off to a great start. ROSS: How old were you? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I was 16. To me, that made it even more devastating because it was, like, yo\\n\\'re supposed to be \"sweet 16,\"\\x9d you know, so I was really messed up. It was like this dude I was going with and he had joined the service and he had been away for his basic training. He came home in his uniform. He was drunk, and I was babysitting, and I let him come in. And I knew that my mother would\\'ve never approved of me having my boyfriend come over where I was babysitting somewhere. So, you know, that was a bad situation and I grieved that for a long time.',\n",
       "  \"OK. As I recall, there was, in 1970 or '71, there was this big women's speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the women's movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillen's apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My Sister's Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power. All the things that everyone criticized women for having as part of an analysis of violence against women ... who now, the mainstream themselves, embrace a large part of that ideology or that perspective, that politic, or that analysis, however you want to say it, about that, that they didn't do before, Post Traumatic Stress [Disorder], you know, rape trauma syndrome, just any number of things that the women were saying in '72, '73, '74 went on for so long, that the more traditional society, law enforcement, medical, social, was rejecting all of that, have now had to come around and embrace it. And not just embrace it, but kind of like take it over and claim it, like this was their thinking, their theory, all along and all the time, which was just so outrageous, such revisionist history. In that house, in that apartment on Q Street, and it stayed there in Jackie's apartment for some time. And from Jackie's apartment, the first place it went was to that small, two-room across the street from Lincoln Junior High School on 16th and Irvin Street. ROSS: OK. There were some feminist magazines, and wasn't there a group called the D.C. Area Feminists Alliance? TOURÃƒÂ‰: FAAR. ROSS: Feminist [Alliance] Against Rape. Tell me about FAAR and ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, FAAR was ... some of the women in FAAR were from the Rape Crisis Center who had left the Rape Crisis Center, wanted to do something else or do some things differently, and so there were people who were interested in publishing, and they got interested because there was also a quarterly scholarly magazine called Quest. Quest preceded FAAR, you know, because it was more scholarly, a quarterly and all that. So you had women who worked on Quest who were interested in putting some focus around rape and so forth, and you had women who had been at the Rape Crisis Center who had an interest in putting out written materials and educating in that way, so they got FAAR magazine. The thing I'm trying to remember, because it had two incarnations, as FAAR and as Aegis magazine. And actually, what I think is that they became FAAR the collective. The magazine was Aegis magazine, and it carried articles and information on sexual assault and theory around sexual assault, you know, all kinds of tips, this, that, the other, different stuff, stories, articles that had to do with empowering women and all of that. Later, Aegis joined with ... oh, yes, and of course, dealing with pornography as well. Later, Aegis joined with domestic violence and half the magazine would deal with issues related to sexual assault, pornography, and the other half would deal with issues dealing with battering and domestic violence. ROSS: Did you get the sense that in the early years, the people at the Rape Crisis Center worked on other forms of violence that women experienced, or was it just gender-based violence? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It was gender-based violence. However, definitely gender based, although the Center did recognize that it was possible for a man to be raped, it was obviously not the primary focus, but there was certainly the acknowledgment that men could be sexually assaulted. You had individuals who worked at the enter who may have had involvement and ties into other movements around other issues, but the Crisis Center was strictly dealing with rape and had its hands full to deal with that, because in '72 and '75, I mean, the police, everybody, I mean, it was a battle. You know, if we ... it still continues to be a struggle, you know, but it was a battle. It was a war, you know, in terms of they didn't want you to have companions. I mean, all rape crisis centers, now you can have a companion with the woman at the hospital that's from the center. So, Oh, no, you couldn't do that. They didn't want you there because you impeded the investigation by being there. So then it was, like, the only way you could be there was if the woman requested that you be there. I mean, it was all these things, you know. Women asked for it. It was just horrendous. So they weren't just dealing ... they were not really making connections to anything else. They were dealing with the dynamics of gender, you know, and as time moves forward, began to ... around different issues, make connections, broaden out ... ROSS: OK. Now, you're saying that your working at the Rape Crisis Center affected your marriage. In what way did your consciousness that you developed at the Center cause you to re-look at your marriage? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It wasn't working at the Rape Crisis Center that caused me to ... I didn't need Rape Crisis Center. I mean, in all honesty, I didn't need the Rape Crisis Center to help me with that at all. When I was saying, working, I meant working in terms of the finances of it. You know, where if the man doesn't have a regular job or steady job and you do even just part-time, full-time, whatever it is, the dynamics that that creates. No, it wasn't a consciousness from the Rape Crisis Center. It was just the consciousness of, you got to go, because somebody's going to get hurt, OK. And so, I ain't fit for it to be me, so, and you're not leaving my child no place else, so you got to go.\",\n",
       "  'ROSS: But there was a book called How to Start a Rape Crisis Center. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: These women in South Africa got hold of this book, and I seem to recall when I was at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center that these white women showed up from South Africa. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, the white women from South Africa. ROSS: Wanting to talk ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: ... to us about how to start a rape crisis center. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Right. ROSS: And they seemed to be a little surprised because they walked in ... this is my story, maybe ... and they looked at Barbara, who was the white women who was the counselor at the time, and they immediately went to her. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Barbara K ... [Kletzick]. ROSS: Right (laughs). And Barbara pointed over to me and said, \"Oh, you need to talk to her.\"\\x9d And you could see their jaws drop when they realized that they had to talk to this bevy of black women about how to start a rape crisis center. And I don\\'t think they were prepared to do that. And I think you were there at that meeting. That\\'s why ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yeah, I remember that now. But when you first said South [Africa], my mind immediately went to the indigenous South African people, and so I was like, what? But now, I do remember that, just as I remember that when we went to Kenya for the end-of-the-decade conference, that our rape reference, the one on the myths and the facts and everything, that we had had the logo done with the faces of women of color, that it had spread itself so many places, and that w\\nen we went, there were people who were somewhat familiar with it. But that once we returned, we just got all kinds of responses from people who had taken it back to their countries and were like using the logo and just using the information. And it was just amazing. It was so great.',\n",

So I'm pretty sure it was 1980 that NBUF was founded, and we had the conference at Howard University, which is where I met a lot of people who were good people, interesting people. One of the reasons that I made a conscious choice to go ahead and deal with the Black United Front was because what I had found, was that in the time I had worked at the Rape Crisis Center, I had really developed some negative feelings about men, and I found it kind of coloring my attitudes, you know, because I had so much rape and so much pornography and domestic violence, and harassment, you know. It was, like, put them all in a plane and send them somewhere by themselves, you know. And of course, it's like, OK, you know, your brother's going up too, your nephews are going, they all are going. It's, like, OK, send somebody else's father and husbands and OK, so I need to be able to be more consciously connected with men, with the other half of the planet, and engaged in how you work things out, because the solution is not for them all going to another planet, and I'm feeling pretty tired when I'm saying, just send them all to another planet, because I'm just tired.\",\n",

And it has a part in there where it talks about feminism, and it\\'s talking about, you know, feminism is about bringing about change, and a number of other things that are part of this idea of what feminism is. And so, it was one of those little retreat things ... I think Deirdre Wright was there, um, Solaria Catherine, Deb Freidman. It was, we were somewhere like up in, oh, Sperryville, Virginia, with this farm that [had] cows and the farmhouse set up on this hill, and you could see from the top of the hill where the house was, you could see down a mountain, and it was really deserted around there. And it was like all of us up there, women of color, lesbians, white women, we were all (laughs) up there together. And so we\\'re having this discussion ... I\\'m not sure, I think Judith Witherow [Native American woman from Appalachia who writes for Sinister Wisdom] might have also been there ... we were having this conversation about feminism. And so I say, \"Well, if feminism is defined as what I\\'m seeing here in this How to Start a Rape Crisis Center, then I guess I\\'m a feminist.\"\\x9d You know, that was pretty basic.',\n",
       "  \"TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, there were some exciting things, because I always looked at it that there was the overall women's movement and within the overall women's movement, there was the women-of-color movement, because over time, many of the women of color had found ways to network and get to know each other and meet each other and do things. One of the things that we were involved in before we were even really very much involved in NCASA [National Committee Against Sexual Assault] was NCADV, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which was much more radical in its thinking and its approach than was the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault. And within NCADV, they had those women of color caucuses, which was so very strong. All of the women, they had the black caucus, the Latina, the Asian, the First Nation, they had all of the ... women of color had caucuses. Well, you know, NCADV was a national organization, so most of the shelters of the country were members of it, and you could see that there were many women of color working in all these shelters, and in crisis centers, which was like something that people just didn't seem to know and didn't seem to get, that there was all this strength here, and [NCADV], they produced a newsletter, as well as doing a women's newsletter. Some of the shelters did their newsletters, and the women-of-color caucus had a newsletter, and it was very powerful. And what I always appreciated about them was how they could meet as individual groupings and then come back together strong as a women-of-color caucus. So women of color were involved in the shelters, in the rape crisis centers, in the health movement ... because they were also working in the health centers, working with women's health care ... there were a number of cases going on from the 70s into the early 80s that raised a lot of consciousness about violence against women, and those cases were raised and that consciousness was raised through women of color. You had Inez Garcia, who was the Latino woman who was imprisoned for killing a man who was trying to assault her. You had Yvonne Wanrow, who was a Native American sister who, her batterer ... she killed her batterer. You had Joanne Little. You had Dessie Woods, who was a case out of the South of a white insurance salesman who had picked her up to give her a ride who raped her and she killed him. These cases ... ROSS: And Joanne Little killed a prison guard, did she not? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, I said Dessie Woods. ROSS: But I'm saying ... Joanne's case. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes, yes, who tried to rape her when she was in prison, yes. So these four cases ... Dessie Woods, Joanne Little, Inez Garcia, Yvonne Wanrow, were cases that raised national attention and brought out a lot of the contradictions, the conflict, you know, was played out and so, it was a very educational process for people who were paying attention. And it was signi\\nicant that these cases, which did so much to further the movement, because it certainly increased ten-fold the dialogue around self-defense, you know, and the right of a woman to self-defense, all of these things. Women of color cases, bringing this to the attention of the nation and of the movement.\",\n",

That's very, very helpful, because I know it was definitely, it was pre- the Rape Crisis Center, but it was right after the Rape Crisis Center that, when you came to the Rape Crisis Center, right around that time, that you proposed me for the Study Group. ROSS: Right. So it's all kind of ... our stories are rather interconnected from then on, but, I'd be fascinated to hear the pre-1978 story of Nkenge. In terms of, well, you stayed at the Rape Crisis Center for 13 years until 1988. In that time you had a variety of jobs. Tell me about some of the more significant things that you did at the Rape Crisis Center. You certainly pioneered quite a bit.\",\n",

So whether you think of us as your children or your prodigies or whatever (laughs), never stop to claim the fact that you created a space for women that didn't exist before.\",\n",

       "  \"FOLLET: Yes, that's right. And she was telling me a story, that she came up to Vermont in the early '90s, maybe '92, '93, to a conference. It was for survivors of sexual abuse, the conference was, and there were 400 people there. And she offered a workshop on dealing with offenders. Not a single person came. A couple of years later, she was invited to give the keynote in Vermont to a conference sponsored by coalitions of rape crisis centers and services and victim advocacy groups, invited to give the keyno\\ne on her work in working with offenders. And because it was the keynote, of course, people did attend. But she said she was met with a kind of stunned silence, almost bordering on hostility. And she knew that Vermont, at the same time, had one ... nationally, one of the most recognized programs for treating, providing treatment to offenders as, I guess, part of the criminal ... WARD: It's the Department of Corrections. FOLLET: -- system, so very advanced in that respect, and yet the women who were survivors and organizations like rape crisis centers who were dealing with this issue were really not ready to touch working with offenders.\",\n",
       "  \"WARD: I think I thought, no wonder I'm so screwed up. (long hearty laugh). Really, I think I did. I thought, God, no wonder. No wonder this and no wonder that, after what I grew up in, you know. And you began to filter that through. This is an example. I remember Harold, all the time we were working I worked in Hanover and he worked in White River, and he would come over, and I would walk down from Hanover and sit on the New Hampshire side of the Ledyard Bridge at the Connecticut River and he would have to come over and pick me up because I wouldn't walk across that bridge. I was deathly scared of walking across bridges with water underneath them. It was all right if they didn't have water underneath it. And I never knew why, never could figure out why, and one time, I remember I came in and he had dropped me off in Vermont. And Harold said, Well, how are you going to get across? I said, Oh, I can do it now. Because I had remembered a time when my father tried to drown me when I was like a year and a half or so old. He was giving me a bath and he was fondling me and I was protesting it and so, he'd stick me under the water, stick my head under the water, and I almost ... I couldn't breathe. And once I remembered that and dealt with that happening and dealt with that fear, I can walk across bridges with water under them all the time now. And I said that to Andy. I said, You know, I wanted to just stand there, walk back and forth, back and forth across that bridge. And he says, Well, that probably would've been all right. They'd have just brought you here anyways. (laugh) And that's the different things that you learn that have stuck with you from what happened to you when you were a child, have come up and you deal with them, and then those fears go away. I could never figure out why I didn't want to stay home alone, and there were times when I would not. I would have someone come stay with me or I'd go stay with someone, and it was all because of the fear of what went on in the nighttime, which is when my father usually abused us. And now, you work through that and I can stay in fine by myself. FOLLET: Uh, huh. WARD: You know, you just work through those things. What it did at that time was [phone rings, voice in background], it allowed me to have respect for myself, to have empathy that I didn't have before, so that was good. FOLLET: Yeah. Um, - WARD: It was about that time, too, that we left from New England and started going cross-country on the trucks and it was after we had dealt with my father. No, let me think. No, that was '93. Oh, and see, we were on the road again, and that was when my niece revealed that she had been abused by my brother. And so during those years I had been doing all this research and so on and learning about child abuse and learning about families, incestuous families and so on (phone rings in background) and so again, the family all turned to me. But I had a good idea of what to do about it then. Much more than what they did, and I knew what needed to happen to help her, and what the rest of the family needed to do. Psychologically I knew. I knew about that. I knew about it being passed down through the generations and who abused who and those different kinds of things. I didn't know the law. I didn't know the law. I knew a lot of the psychological stuff I had learned on my own. I had learned about myself and about other people that went through it and so on.\",\n",
       "  \"It really did, because the stuff I was learning on my own, a lot of that ... some of it came from Freud, and Bowen is not Freud. It's the whole family, and so I began to understand that it wasn't just victim-perpetrator, that the whole family in some ways were involved. And what I mean by that is that one person in the family moves and it causes everybody else to move. It's like a mobile. You move one part of it and all the rest of it moves. And that was part of the reason why when my family ... it was at that time when my family still was turned against me -- my mother, my father, my brother, my oldest sister, and how wrong I was and that the reason that Richard was in jail was because I had put him there and it was a conspiracy because I was mad at my mother and father for what they had done and that I was a liar and I was crazy and I was nuts and I was making up all of this and nobody wanted to believe or accept or admit what I said was true. Um, and those members of the family and a lot of the extended family members, too, that were still all bound in this horror of child abuse and spouse abuse. One of the things I learned from Bowen is if I can just stay my own, eventually others in the family will change, and that did happen. It happened ... I mean, my younger sisters and so on, they believed what I said and added to it, what had happened to them. And eventually, my brother came around and said, yes, there were other cousins and nieces and nephews that said, yes, we've been abused, too, and eventually my older sister admitted it and my mother has and my brother did before he died. Now there are more people in the family that admit it and say, yes, this happened, than the other that say, no. I really have just one uncle left that still denies.\",\n",
       "  \"We have people come in that speak with them about the various issues that they want to cover and it's always domestic violence and child abuse. They want to cover that, and I do most of the education on that.\",\n",
       "  \"drive for us, and he couldn't drive for some reason, he was sick or something. So we were each operating a truck, and we had done that some, because we had three trucks at the time, so we took on a lot. We had a little trucking business of our own. And so, there were times when I would operate the truck by myself, and it allowed me to think, I think. You know, you're by yourself then and so on. And of course in '89, that was two years, I think, after my niece had revealed that my father had sexually abused her. And at that point in time, I still wouldn't admit even to myself that we had ... that I had been abused. I just said, it didn't happen in my family. Yeah, it happened to other people, but it didn't happen to me. It might have even happened to my older sister or whatever. It happened to some of the others, but I'm sure it didn't happen to me. And I just ... it was one of those things where if you don't allow yourself to think about it, you just say, I'm not going to think about it. I'm not going to think about, that it goes back further enough in your brain so that you don't think about it and you just ... it's like it's a cutoff there. And I say a cutoff, it was almost like there was a curtain drawn there, and yo\\n don't draw that curtain back. Because if you do, God forbid. And that's what it was like. And then, it was almost like when I started to look at what was behind that curtain, there was just like a flood of stuff that came out. And that was all the stuff that I had just stored back there, and had chosen not to talk about it or not even think about for years, since I had left home as a child, really since the time I had been 13 or so. I just, you just don't think about it. It was very easy to do all those years, I think, because there was so much else going on. Harold and I were married and we had his family to think about because his father died. And then my family expected me to solve all of their problems. Whenever anything went wrong, they came to Wynona to solve the problems, and the same with Harold's family. They came to him. So it was just ... you know, it was ... there was so much other going on. Then we had the trucks and we were on road and I ran the business, essentially. And I ran the business side of it and Harold did the mechanical side and ran that part of it. And then we shared the driving. So our lives were really, really hectic and busy. And at that point in time, I think I felt safe enough and secure enough, and was with Harold enough at that point in time so that I could be comfortable and talk about it, and really re-live some of the stuff that went on. And it was a hard time. But it brought Harold and I really close. FOLLET: It did? WARD: Oh, yeah. Because he was there. He was like my everyday shrink, someone that could ... was further enough away from it so it was like he could be almost an objective person about it. Not really, because in some ways, but in other ways he could be. In other ways, he could confirm things for me, too, because he'd known me since I was 13. FOLLET: Right. WARD: I remember when I went to the doctor about whether I had a learning disability or not and I came home and said she wanted me to think about back when I was kid, you know, where there some things I was behind in developing. And I said, You've known me since I was 13. What do you think? And he has this dry sense of humor, so he said, Well, you've always been a klutz. (laugh). And it's true. And it's more than likely because of the learning disability that I have, which was caused from domestic violence. My balance isn't good. It's never been good. And I have a hard time with that. And so it's things like that that he has seen and realized about me, that others wouldn't have known, because he's known me for so long. But at that time, yeah, that's when I really started thinking about it and studying about it and reading about it and realizing that this is what happened in our family. And of course, when my niece revealed that she'd been abused by my father and we went through that whole ordeal, then it was like my sisters and I were really close for a while, a period there, and then we just all pulled apart and went our own separate ways because it was so hard to deal with, so hard to deal with. And they had their families and I was on the road and all of that, and it was very, very difficult to deal with. And they didn't want to deal with it. Nobody wanted to deal with it anymore. Just the same thing as always had happened in the past -- put in on the back burner, it'll go away and it won't happen again. But I didn't let that happen. Instead, I delved into it, and I really wanted to find out what it was all about, and so I did a lot of research on my own. And this was before I was at Vermont College. Whether it was in a bookstore, because when we were hauling different loads, we were in the cities and so on and I could go to a bookstore or wherever and research a lot like that, or could buy books from on the road, and had time to read on the road, where they didn't and they didn't want to deal with it, and so I could pick up these books and read different books about it. I read Judith Lewis Herman's book Father-Daughter Incest. I read Carol Gilligan. I read her book and different books like that I was reading. That's when, I think, how I got my first look at feminism and women and that type of thing was through those books, through Carol Gilligan and Judith Lewis Herman, really. And they were on my own, when I was on the road at that point in time. And I wasn't doing it for school, I was just doing it for myself. The Courage to Heal book, I read that then. Other books about child abuse, and feminist books then, too -- Gloria Steinem and some of those things. I was picking them up and reading them on my own. FOLLET: You were. WARD: Yeah, while we were on the road. FOLLET: Do you remember any ah-hah moments of particular books or particular ideas that really hit home? WARD: Well, of course, Judith Lewis Herman's book Father-Daughter Incest was oh, my God, this is our family. You know, I really think I was at Vermont College before I really started talking about a lot of it. FOLLET: Hm. You talked to Howard, I mean Harold. Sorry. You talked to Harold and you did reading on your own. Did you seek any assistance or- WARD: When things got difficult and I was going through some of the childhood stuff, I saw a psychiatrist for about eight months or so, whenever I could. It was kind of once a week but not really. And just around the psychological stuff of what's going on and how do I handle this and I don't want to see my mother and father anymore and confronting them about what went on and so on, and saw him for about that length of time. And the rest of it was really on my own. I had a friend in California who had ... she had gotten a lot into feminism and that type of thing and so different articles and so on she would refer to me and I would read them, and really started researching on my own on it. FOLLET: At that point, as you started to come\",\n",
       "  \"WARD: When I was ... summer between my second and third year in law school, I worked at the attorney general's office and worked in their child protection agency team there. W had a conference and it was on internet child pornography and how they were prosecuting that. I think that was in 1997, the summer of '97, how we were beginning to be able to prosecute child porn and so on. And I think that it's really important that we realize that that's out there and that it can affect our children, and that it can be devastating for them, especially when you hear of -- whether it's older men or older women who will get on the internet with these young people and pretend that they're a young person and come meet me and then you hear of children being killed or raped or the circumstance that happens from that type of connection to pornography. In the same voice, -- and this stems from my law school education, I think, too -- in one of my last cases, it was brought up because he had porn in his house and he was an abuser, and we mentioned it, and that he was showing it to his 6year-old son as if this was an accepted way of life, and we brought it up as a fact that it was not an acceptable parenting skill, that that showed that he did not have any parenting skills. So I've used it that way as such, but I also realize that the Constitution gives adults the right to observe and look at porn as part of the Constitution. Do you see what I mean? And so you get that battle going back and forth. Personally, I feel that if women are looked at as sexual, their bodies are just looked at as sexual bodies, then you're not thinking about their mind, you're not thinking about their worth, you're not thinking about what they can give to society or a relationship, or, you know, that type of thing. So I think we could do without it without any problem. I wouldn't hesitate at all to use it in my cases if this was ... and I have already done it, that this shows an inappropriate parenting skill, if that's what was happening, if they were being shown to children. And I think as far as bringing children into that, and that type of thing, it's terrible and it needs to be stopped, just the same as child abuse needs to be stopped. Child porn is part of child abuse.\",\n",
       "  \"When we were growing up in the '50s, that's just how it was, and there wasn't a victim advocacy group. The only time anybody on the outside interfered was if, you know, someone was murdered or killed or that type of thing. But now people, I feel, feel more inclined and feel it's their responsibility to interfere and to help, although many still don't. And I think that's where we need to do more work, especially in rural areas, that it's not acceptable. I feel that child sexual abuse is just now where spouse abuse was probably twenty years ago. It's just we're really beginning to say it's not OK and we have to do something about it.\",\n",
       "  \"WARD: And it did. I remember when Stop It Now! first came to Vermont, it was not respected because they felt that, oh, here we have someone on the abuser's side, the batterer's side, and the whole idea of the domestic violence movement then was you get the victims out, including the mothers and the children, and you send the perpetrators to jail. And that's the solution. And when someone had a solution besides that, then it was wrong. But I think what a lot of that stemmed from was the fact that at that time it was still very common in the legal system and in society to blame the victim, and that it was the victim's fault. And so many times, even today, when I speak, a hand will raise and they'll say, Well, why doesn't she leave? or, Why does she go back? or, Why does she stay? SO I will logically go through all of the ... there is an actual chart that I have with a circle, like the power-and-control wheel, but it's why she stays, and around it will be the psychological reasons, the children, the economic reasons that we've already talked about it, the legal reasons ... he gets a pat on the hand and that's it and don't do that again, and the family reasons and the religious reasons and all of that, the logical reasons, and then I will say, and I'll flash on the screen with my Power Point and I'll say, But isn't the real question why does he beat her? Because when you're asking why does he beat her, you're asking for the batterer to take accountability for what he does, instead of putting the onus on her, that it's her responsibility to leave, it's her responsibility to get out, it's her responsibility to stop the violence. And so because that went on for so many years, and still goes on, I think, like in rape cases, where they blame the victim, they put the victim on the stand and abuse her all over again, which can happen in domestic violence cases, too, domestic assault cases. And because of that, there was that staunch feminist movement that said, What the solution to this problem is, is get them out and put the abuser in jail. But I think at the same time, as that was a solution at the time. That was one of the solutions at the time. But as society has looked at the whole problem and realized that, yes, that's part of the solution, but if you look at it from a family systems theory point of view, or from just a logical point of view, you take them away from that but then he's going to seek out others to do the same because you haven't done anything to change him. And so, I think the pendulum has swung now and that a lot of the domestic violence movement as such is to help the batterer, to get him treatment and so on.\",\n",
       "  \"WARD: I learned very early on, at the age of 2 or 3, that you don't talk about this. My mother and my grandmother both -- my maternal grandmother. When I speak of my grandmother, for the most part, it's my maternal grandmother. We had very little to do with my paternal grandmother because she lived at that time what we felt was a long distance away. It was about 40 miles away, so. Of course, that was a long way away then. But my maternal grandmother lived just two miles away. And they made it very clear to all of us that you do not talk about this, that this is shameful, that it's bad, that it only happens to you. We didn't talk about it to one another within the household, what went on, because it was supposed to be kept a secret and it was the divide-and-conquer, which is very common with incestuous families, what happens. So we never talked about it. We didn't discuss it. It was just understood that you don't bring friends home, and mothers in the neighborhood knew that, they wouldn't allow their children in our house. They knew what went on. I was welcome to go to other girls' houses and stay overnight but we were never allowed to bring friends home. And not because my mother wouldn't allow it, it was because other mothers wouldn't allow it. FOLLET: Because they knew. WARD: They knew. You just didn't discuss it. FOLLET: Did you have-? WARD: It was understood. It was almost like it was an understood, unspoken way of life. FOLLET: So you had exposure to other families or to other messages that made you think of your own family situation as having something wrong going on? WARD: Oh, yeah. Wrong or something that wasn't ... yes, it would have been wrong, not accepted by others, not OK with others, shameful, very shameful. So you hid it and you didn't discuss it. And it was like black and white. I've often said with children, what children learn, if a child grows up in a home and is told all their life that black is white and then they go to school and they're told, no, white is black, they're going to adjust and know that at school that they have to say white is black. But when they go home at night, they know that black is white and you just adjust. You go back and forth. It's no different than children that go back and forth between divorced families. You learn the rules at each place, and you learn, in a divorced family, you learn that at dad's house you eat at 6 o'clock, and at mom's house you eat at 8:30. And this is no different. You learn that you don't say this is school and you don't discuss it in school, and at home, you know, it's different.\",\n",
       "  \"But, in the same instance, I'll tell you that one of my nieces -- she will be here tomorrow, she's meeting a client here, a mutual client, and asking that I represent the children in the case where there has been child sexual abuse.\",\n",
       "  \"WARD: I think it's because I want people to realize. I recently said, and this is an example, to an opposing client who has finally admitted that he abused his wife and is going into a batterer's intervention program, and we were dealing with supervised visitation for this child, and I said to him, When you get into your batterer's group, you talk with your facilitator. I will be happy to come. Because he was trying to say that the child was only 2 when the battering went on and she didn't really see any of it. So I said, I remember back, vividly, when I was 2 years old and there was abuse going on in my family. And when you get into your group, you ask your facilitator if I can come and talk to you in your group so that you will know what it feels like to be a child and have your parents abusing one another, I said, or to have your father beating your mother. I said, I will be happy to come and talk to you about that and read to yo\\n some of my writings about what that experience is like. I said, Then you will know what it's like to be a child and know what it feels like to be abused and how traumatic and how frightening it is. Because I think that is the way, if I can reach people with that message, that they will realize that it has to stop, that it can't continue on, because if it does, then that's what we're doing to our future generations that we expect to take care of us and expect to take care of the world. So I think it's very important. I often say we will not stop street violence and we will not stop school violence until we stop violence in the home. Because as I said to you yesterday, even though things go on at school that you know are not acceptable at school and they're acceptable at home, deep down inside you learn that it's acceptable anywhere, and you can bring it from the home into the school and onto the streets and so if you can stop it in the home, I think that's the key to where it all starts. And, you know, if - the whole idea that women need to be equal with men and can be equal with men. One of the things that has always turned me against the Bible and against religion is that my father would quote from the Bible while he was, you know, the next minute abusing my mother or abusing one of his daughters, as if he were supported by the Bible for doing this, and would turn it all around. So for a long time I was against the teachings of the Bible, but now, I can look at it more objectively and realize that yes, it's very patriarchal, especially the Old Testament, which is what he would quote from, but now I can look at it and realize that that was the way he interpreted it. FOLLET: Did he quote actual passage to justify actual abuse? WARD: He would ... well, you read the Bible. Nowhere in the Bible does it prohibit father-daughter incest. It prohibits everything else ... brother-sister, um, mother-son, and everything, but father-daughter incest is not prohibited.\",\n",
       "  \"So if they come to me, I try to provide them with as much as I can, although I'm not a counselor, but I try to hook them up with and point them in the right direction to get the counseling that they need. We do provide some counseling in the Women in Transition group, the support group. It's more like an education and mentoring group, it's not run by a psychologist or a counselor. We have people come in that speak with them about the various issues that they want to cover and it's always domestic violence and child abuse. They want to cover that, and I do most of the education on that.\",\n",
       "  \"WARD: And I think, you know, that's what I thought about my own family, too. I'm not going to see the domestic violence or the child abuse stop in the world, but it's stopped so that my great nieces and nephews now won't [01:02:44: END TAPE 2].\",\n",
       "  \"WARD: By that time I had read about it and I knew what it was about, and when this happened, I said, This has to stop. I said this to myself. I said this to my niece, to my sisters, to Harold, to my sister's husbands, to anybody that I could talk to. This has to stop. It cannot keep going on. It happened to me, it happened to you, it happened to you, it happened to you. This has to stop now. [speaks with emphasis, points finger] And that's what propelled me into helping that case. The only way this is going to stop, I had researched that. I looked up a lot of stuff. How do I get help for Richie, my brother? He has to stop this. He has to get help. You know, I didn't see him as being a culprit or being a criminal. I know he was, there's no question he was, and there's no question my father was, but I saw it as a sickness. And everybody in the family did. And so I said, The only way he's going to get help, from what I've read -- I had read Salter, Anna Salter's book Treating Child Sex Offenders and Victims -- and the only way he's going to get help is to go to prison. That's where he's going to get help, and he's going to get in-house treatment that way. Otherwise, he's never going to get help. So I said, We have to put him in jail. And my sister wanted him punished, because he had abused her and then he had abused her daughter, and, you know, she really ... she wanted him to get help but at the same time, this is wrong, he needs to be punished. So that really propelled me after that to want to do something else. And we had this friend. Her daughter had been sexually abused. She had gone through SRS [Social Rehabilitative Services] and gotten a divorce, and she'd been sexually abused by her father and so through a mutual friend, we were talking, and she said she was working ... and she had gotten her BA and she said, You know, there's this is Vermont College. You can go there weekends if you want, but I think they've got something where you don't have to go but a couple of times a year, and you could finish then. So I said, Oh, all right. So I called and got information on it. She wrote me a recommendation. Another friend wrote me a recommendation, and I got in. And that's when ... when I went to Vermont College, I think that's when I really got exposed to feminism as such. I got exposed to more of Judith Lewis Herman, to more of Carol Gilligan. I did child development and started with some of the women's, the way women look at -- Mary Belensky, Women's Ways of Knowing. All of those books like that were written. Alice Eichholz, who was my professor and was about my age, a little bit younger, had me read all these books, (Harold's voice in background) and that's, I think, when my eyes opened up as to how unequal things are between men and women and how unequal they've been.

       "  \"WARD: Yes, a public spokesperson. My sisters speak openly, my younger sisters, about what happened to them and how wrong it was and how traumatic it was. And they talk amongst their friends or with me or other professionals or whatever. But they're not a public spokesman for it like I am. But they support me. They've heard me speak and listened and have participated in some of the efforts that I have made, whether it's interviewing with reporters or, you know, just giving information and so on. And so they've been helpful. But their lives focus around their children's lives. Where I've been more of a spokesman for it and said that this is wrong and it needs to change and this is how we can change it. And I think that's because ... I don't know if it's because they have children and that has to be their everyday focus. But, in the same instance, I'll tell you that one of my nieces -- she will be here tomorrow, she's meeting a client here, a mutual client, and asking that I represent the children in the case where there has been child sexual abuse. And so that niece is out there working. She works in a child psychology type position, a case manager position for one of the local mental health centers in the area, so she is actively out there and she has three children, but she's actively out there in this area. I have another niece who, in New Jersey, works with the elderly now in nursing homes and so on and does a lot to make sure that the elderly aren't abused. Now that's a niece that my nephew married. It's not a direct blood relation, but ... so there are people in my family that go into the social service area and I think a lot of that is because they see the need and realize ... as the generations come down, even though that generation was not abused, they're still affected by it. You know, just like you talk about the Holocaust. One of my best friends, she's a doctor in Ann Arbor ... her mother was a victim of the Holocaust. So she wasn't, but it affects her still. It affects the generations after that. And so I think that's something that even though my great-nieces and nephews will not be abused, that they will still be affected by what happened in their families\",\n",

They then formed what then became the original rape crisis center here and the Women's Health Collective, Durham Women's Health Cooperative we were, cooperative, we were not a collective. So that women from the two different groups came together and they re-divided so that one group was going to do the rape crisis and one group was going to do the women's health.

You know, we were being cooperative about our live. Until, and I remember this so vividly, in my third year of medical school when you start being on call and doing rotations I couldn\\'t eat with them every Sunday night because sometimes I was on call. . . . I had been on my surgery rotation and I was having dinner with them and I told them some of the things that had happened. And they said that is not true Margie you are making that up. . . . A Hispanic male surgery resident was chief resident who was obnoxious, absolutely horrible, mean, nasty to almost everybody, very very homophobic and one thing came after another and I don\\'t know the order in which things actually happened. There was a hairdresser who was very stereotypically gay who was in for a liver transplant and we were standing outside of his room on rounds and he said, \"I\\'m not going in there, he disgusts me. We shouldn\\'t be putting a liver into him.\" I remember being a livid and I remember saying, \"I don\\'t want you going into that room, don\\'t you dare step foot into that room. I\\'m going to take care of this guy.\" (She nervously laughs) . . . On this particular day a fairly young guy came in for emergency surgery that was clouting with everything bloody ( ), I don\\'t quite remember, we were on a ( ) team. I was, we started the surgery before an attending came so it was ( ), another resident and me. And as they were doing the stuff, you know pulling the retractions and other things, they were trying to make these guy\\'s blood squirt at my breasts. They were sort of being competitive in terms of who could hit me closest to my nipple and uhm. Yeah. JMD: And you were the only female in the room? MBS: Yeah I am but there had to be a nurse in there of something, but clearly of the medical team. And finally, you know there is sort of like nothing you can do, you know. An attending finally came and came in and the guy ended up dying. Uhm, they wouldn\\'t let me talk to the guy\\'s wife. This was sort of the first patient I had that had died and had me go off and do other things. I remember being angry enough that I talked to the attending. And he said it must have been accidental and I said no, this was literally what they were doing and saying. And he did say that that was unacceptable, and after that the guy made it really, really hard for me and I flunked that three weeks of surgery.

MB: She is now a Carrboro Board of Alderman. And Michelle was a volunteer at the Rape Crisis Center and eventually was on the Board and was on the staff for a while and she was very instrumental. I learned a great deal from her. She had given me some input, and she really helped us start a Diversity Committee and to think intentionally about how sexual violence intersects with other forms of oppression. Then when we did strategic planning probably either midway or a little more than that when I was at the Rape Crisis Center, we did a big strategic planning process. We ended up with a vision. I was sharing it last week because I was doing a training about a form of strategic planning and facilitating the meeting and I said oh when I was at the Rape Crisis Center our vision was a world free of sexual violence and all other forms of oppression. That may still be the vision. I haven't looked at it lately but very ambitious. And then we tried to focus in our mission on stopping sexual violence and its impact through support, education and advocacy. Thanks to the incredible volunteers like Michelle and Linda Brooks and some other folks, really we did try to focus on diversity in a really intentional way, not just one aspect but lots of different aspects. And we focused a lot on disability issues, we were very fortunate, there was a project going on with the state Office of Health and Disability, and they contacted us and said, we would like to provide you all with funding and support to improve your services for survivors of sexual assault with disabilities. And so they came in and did an assessment for us and helped implement a lot of things. Everything from a disability parking space to Braille on the door to helping us look at how our documents wouldn't be accessible to people with learning disabilities, all sorts of stuff. And they did trainings for our volunteers.\",\n",
       "  \"I became very immersed in doing this Helpline crisis intervention. One of the jobs of Helpline volunteers was we served as the first response crisis contact for the Orange County Rape Crisis Center. And for what then was the Orange-Durham Coalition for Battered Women. And so I think of that as my first introduction to the rape crisis center. I'm sure I knew about it in various ways when I was an undergraduate student. But that was my first time contributing somehow to the mission of the center. And it was also my introduction to crisis intervention as something that I really liked being involved in. So after a bit of time being a Helpline volunteer, I ended up going to law school, and I kept doing that volunteer work, and I had been doing it long enough at that point that they invited me to be one of the trainers for the volunteer classes. It was still a volunteer position but I felt like I was more part of that work. So that was my introduction to actually participating in the kind of really excellent volunteer training that I think Orange County Rape Crisis Center still does.\",\n",
       "  'I came back to a job as Assistant Dean of Students and Judicial Programs Officer at UNC Chapel Hill, which was really a huge dream job for me. And part of my job there was going to be training student leaders around how to handle hearings, disciplinary hearings and those kinds of things. Part of it was sexual assault issues and helping to do compassionate appropriate response to students who were survivors of sexual violence and also helping to draft and administer policies around sexual violence. So there had been a lot of controversy on campus around sexual violence at that time or soon before I started. So the issues for the Committee on Student Conduct and some other initiatives that I was involved in really did focus a lot on sexual violence, and in that role within my first year I had been to the Orange County Rape Crisis Center several times because I really wanted to build that relationship with the university. So I would go to the Rape Crisis Center and participate in the volunteer trainings and talk about the university\\'s response, help prepare the rape crisis companions, how, what they might expect if they were helping a survivor through the university discipline processes or other ways the university could support survivors. And that was a really important part of my job. I also was one of the people at UNC that would greet survivors of sexual assault and help them determine what their options were and--. So then seven years into that I was Associate Dean of Students and Judicial Officer. And I had a chance, the Dean of Students had retired, and I had a chance to partially fill in that role for about a year, a year and a half, and I reached a point where I thought I was ready to transition into something different. I had been on one or two non-profit boards and I decided that I was going to consider non-profit management, and I started telling my friends, \"Oh I would really like to work somewhere in non-profit management, maybe somewhere like the Orange County Rape Crisis Center.\" So I started quietly telling friends that, just for more of a long-term plan. I wasn\\'t thinking of it as short term. I remember telling one of my best friends, \"oh and I\\'m going to talk to Margaret Henderson who\\'s the director of Rape Crisis Center and see if I could ever maybe shadow her sometime and see what she does or maybe do even an internship there or something.\" And lo and behold, about a week after I start saying all this Margaret Henderson announced she was leaving. And I saw it literally in the paper, which was really strange. And I thought, \"Oh no, now this is something I have to think about and consider a little bit more quickly because obviously I had been very drawn to the work and to the organization and to non-profit work.\" And then all of a sudden there\\'s that opportunity there that I really was not--, not necessarily prepared for all aspects of it. I had not had a lot of fundraising or development experience. I had not had huge amounts of financial management experience. But I had been immersed in the issues around sexual violence, and I had done a lot of volunteer training and a lot of work with clients and survivors of sexual violence, and I knew the community and I was part of the system that cared for sexual violence survivors. So there was a big piece of it that I felt real confident about and then there was a big piece of it that I was less certain. And I remember they had a really intense interview process. I had to come and meet with three different groups during that summer, and I remember how supportive Margaret Henderson was when I told her that I was applying, and I\\'m sure she was probably supportive to everyone who was involved in it if there were other candidates. So after the intensive interview process where I had to write an essay or something--I think the essay was to tell people why I was interested in the job--I ended up getting the job. So that was how my career at the Orange County Rape Crisis Center began.',\n",
       "  'MB: It was primarily around how cases were handled by the student judicial system. So it\\'s much like some of the dialogue going on now and my memory, I have to be cautious because I don\\'t want to share things that would\\'ve been confidential obviously. That many years ago it\\'s hard maybe to separate, but there definitely was some public controversy because the Committee on Student Conduct was considering all the policies based on input they had gotten from the Rape Crisis Center as well as from some student groups like the Rape Action Project and the, what was the organization called? It might have been called Women Against Rape. WAR\" SB: WAR, yeah. MB: But I can\\'t remember. As [it] happens now a few student groups changed their names so it would be one acronym. It was ASAP for a while, Advocates of Students Against--, Advocates for Sexual Assault Prevention. That\\'s what it was. ASAP. SB: The Feminist Students United is the direct--, there\\'s a direct lineage from ASAP to the group. MB: And ASAP might have been the WAR first and the Rape Action Project. So all that was swirling around when I came to UNC, which ultimately helped. Over my years, the seven years I was at UNC I was not always the direct sexual assault person. There were other people in our office, mainly Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and later Don Appiairus because I was the Judicial Officer. So I tended to do a lot of sexual assault to help train about what it was like to go through the student judicial system. And because we would have gaps in coverage somebody would leave, and then it would take a while to replace, I was the direct person a lot of times, for sometimes as much as a year at a time. But I wasn\\'t always that direct person and so that was always something that stayed with me that that was an interest I was, I wanted to do more on, which was a big part of what led me to the Rape Crisis Center, bringing it back to OCRCC. And actually when I got to the Rape Crisis Center I do think it was good that I had those university relationships but probably for a good while I needed to focus more on building those community relationships. I look back and it\\'s hard to remember exactly, but I probably did less with the university but more encouraged other staff to partner with the university so that I could focus on building relationships with the County, with the Town of Chapel Hill, Hillsborough, Carrboro, and with other donors like the United Way. I remember spending a lot of time my first couple years with United Way because they were restructuring and you had to be part of several committees with United Way. We got some funding through a children and youth committee and some funding through what I think was a self-sufficiency committee for our client work. So it was interesting. I came from the university background, but I didn\\'t do as much with that once I was over with Rape Crisis because the County is such a huge entity. It was surprising to me because I having been on campus for a long time and then you think of the campus as such a big part, but then when you are in a position when you are serving the whole county you realize how much broader it is.',\n",
       "  'MB: I don\\'t think so. I mean I came in to--, because I was committed to being the Judicial Officer. That was my primary scope of work. I definitely came in to be -- neutral is the wrong word--, but objective. One of the things that brought me to Rape Crisis was the desire to be more of an advocate. When you\\'re a Judicial Officer, you can\\'t be an advocate. You have to be really balanced and you can support students who are in front of you and you can help them know what their resources are and where they can go, but you have to really balance that, if you\\'re the Judicial Officer, you have to see the whole picture and make sure everybody\\'s getting fair judgment. Honestly, wanting to be more overtly, do more overt advocacy was part of what drew me to the Rape Crisis Center. Because you\\'re always in different roles. SB: Interesting. It\\'s knowing the whole picture, coming to the Rape Crisis Center but you had to know what it was like to be a respond\\nng party within the system. That sounds like a really valuable set of experiences. MB: Yeah, I mean it was different. For me it was nice to have more focus on one issue. Sexual violence is obviously broader than one issue. So it\\'s very broad. But coming from UNC I was dealing with academic dishonesty; I was dealing with substance abuse issues, alcohol, sexual violence, student crises, suicide prevention, all of this wide range of issues. And so it was freeing to come and focus more directly on one issue that\\'s really important and that intersects with so many other issues in a lot of ways. And that\\'s one of the things I love about the Rape Crisis Center is that it stayed true to its mission and a really focused mission, and sometimes there\\'s temptations to bring issues together which you do to solve problems, but I think sexual violence especially lends itself to getting submerged if you don\\'t have something that focuses directly on it. So I\\'ve been really proud that the Rape Crisis Center has continued to have rape in the name for example. And that was a debate that every once in a while would come up in my years. I think it always does. \"Oh, should we consider changing the name? Should we make it broader?\" And ultimately folks would always go back to the sign on Estes Drive. We were the little house on Estes Drive my whole time there, which is exciting to be here in this nice space on Franklin Street. I still am just amazed when I come in here. And I thought the space on Estes Drive was really nice because the Center had been, I don\\'t know if Margaret Henderson talked to you about that. But they had been in this little old rickety house on Rosemary Street. And so getting the space on Estes Drive was a big deal when Margaret Henderson was there. I had visited there and gone to training. So keeps moving into cleaner, nicer spaces that is good, giving people more of a feeling of self-care, protection, whatever.',\n",

       "  \"Mary and I had the distinct experience of going to court at one time to try to keep Rape Crisis Center records private. So that felt like a historical moment. So I joke sometimes when people, people wonder if I can keep something confidential. And I'll say sometimes well, I went to court before to protect confidentiality. You can trust me. I'm not going to spill your secrets. So that was a big thing where we had been served with a subpoena to release some client records and there's a lot of media, and there was a lot of media coverage around that. Bob Epting, who is this fantastic local attorney who is also a pilot and flies small planes ( ). Bob came and represented us for free as we didn't think we should have to release records. So that was an important moment and we got recognized for that work by the NC Center for Nonprofits. Somewhere around here there's a little award from that. So that was good. That felt like we were doing something for other Rape Crisis Centers as well. We also had other board presidents like Shauna Hay and Shelley Golden and Elin Abercrombie and Amy Preble, just really great folks. Most of our board presidents while I was at the Rape Crisis Center came from the pool of volunteers. They had been trained in being a rape crisis companion or being a Community Educator and came at it with that strong training and then rose into being a leader, being a Board President type of leader. That was really important that folks have that grounding. One thing that really stayed strong and still is that commitment to strong training which is expensive if you think about it. It's really hard to do forty to sixty hours of training, and it's hard for people to devote that time. So that was a real commitment the agency had. I'm sure they've tried to stay as close to that as they can. But it got harder and harder because there were a lot of organizations you could volunteer for without having that much training.\",\n",
       "  \"MB: I don't stay up on it as much. There used to be more communication, public communication with the folks who were handling the policies directly than I perceive that there is now. But that's just a perception in terms of talking to media and things like that. It seems like over the last few years that's been concentrated at higher levels, and so there's not always as much as much direct communication about what really happens at the student level. So I think that's just a different way of running things than the leadership was running things when I was there. I don't mean the leadership, at the Dean of Students' level--. But seems like the higher levels, that there's less which is ironic because there's also so much social media and that kind of conversation. SB: Like you can follow someone who is head of undergraduate research on Twitter but not--. MB: But maybe not, maybe that person is not going to be empowered to talk to a reporter, which is a different thing. It's like, is social media causing institutions to control their communication more by not having it be a dialogue? I don't know. But we definitely were engaging a lot. Now that doesn't mean that we had everything solved, and there were lots of bumpy issues around sexual assault when I was at the university where we were starting [to] doing more training and things like that. And the Rape Crisis Center had been pushing for us to do a better job. By the time I got to UNC they were already pushing for that. That would be interesting research to look back at some of the cases, some of the around 1992, [19]93 you'd find some interesting news articles. SB: Yeah. Right when the student governments started adjudicating cases under the honor system of sexual assault. MB: Yeah, I don't know how far that went back, but yeah it probably went back to the late [19]80s, early [19]90s\",\n",
       "  \"MB: I should say that I, we had an incredible Dean of Students Fred Schroeder, and then Melissa Exum for my last year was the Dean of Students. Then there were always other Assistant Deans of Students. There was Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and Ron Binder did Greek Affairs and Judy Barter before Ron Binder, so there were a lot of people in the Dean of Students office. There was also a Sexual Harassment officer who did more of that Title IX because that was more the staff and faculty. So we networked a lot with that office. So yeah, I wasn't doing everything they are doing. I mean they've expanded. Thankfully they have expanded the Dean of Students' office staff, and they have more staff than they had when we were there. But it wasn't easy. It was always twenty-four-seven because there were so many students and so many different expectations. But we didn't have, it sounds so funny but we barely had the internet when I first started. We didn't have email. There was no Facebook. So there were certain things that take a lot of time nowadays that you didn't have then. You had, we were doing paper letters, those kinds of things. It was very, very different. That brings me to the thought when I started at the rape crisis center. Two people on the staff had email, Christina and the Orange County office. Christina in the northern Orange office had it because they had set up her office fairly recently,\\nin the last year and they wanted her to have email so that she could communicate easily with the staff in Chapel Hill, and Matt may have been the one that had it because he would copy messages for Margaret Henderson.\",\n",
       "  'MB: Well, I mean for me and maybe not for everybody, the Rape Crisis Center when I was working here it really was a family to me. It was, as you can imagine, pretty intense to work in sexual violence. You may work in it yourself. But it\\'s very intense and to do it you develop a lot of camaraderie and really love and support for the folks you work with. So it seemed normal. Maybe it wasn\\'t normal. But a Rape Crisis Center is not just your garden variety workplace. SB: In order to not have people dropping out every few years, which still happens for a number of great reasons you need to have strong, something other than a passion for ending rape because\". MB: Yeah, you need a lot of support and, but I do think that that\\'s part of what makes it hard to stay in for a long, long time. I mean eight years definitely seemed like a long time. It is that intensity of, intensity of the issue, intensity of the work, intensity of keeping a small nonprofit afloat. So kudos to Shamecca and everybody for keeping it going. SB: Forty years, almost. It\\'s amazing because I developed relationships or been friends with people who do this sort of work and this is a twenty year old but only have relationships with people who have done this, this kind of work. Was it strange going out of rape crisis work or--? MB: Oh definitely. SB: Yeah. MB: Definitely. Because, even now it feels strange sometimes during holidays and things where I\\'m not thinking about who might have the pager or should I have the pager or I\\'m not on\"I\\'m not thinking about who\\'s on call. But that is a big deal. When you\\'re working in Rape Crisis Center, you\\'re always aware that somebody is on call. I ran into last week because we have kids at the same school, a man who was a detective. And he doesn\\'t work in that field anymore either, but he was a detective who investigated sexual assault cases and we were reminiscing about being at the hospital in the middle of the night and never sure what the call was going to be and those kinds of things and so it does. It feels --I\\'m sure there\\'s a certain amount of -- well there\\'s really a great appreciation for those who are doing it.',\n",

I was also shocked that some of the things that I thought were over and done in the '60s were still happening on college campuses. I was really shocked. So the two things at once have really been important to me this year, about the kinds of issues that especially young women are facing&#8211;young people, but especially young women are facing&#8211;on college campuses. I just thought that was old history. [Laughs] SCB: To give the listeners some context, this spring, and last fall as well, several students have filed complaints against the university and now the university is in the process of revising its sexual assault policies to comply with Title IX and the Clery Act and other nondiscrimination policies, which leads me to another question. You've spent your adult life in a time when Title IX has been implemented, and you spoke just now about how it's interesting to see how we're still struggling with things that should have been over and done. Was Title IX a big event for you, having that in place? AC: Yeah, I was aware of it, but it didn't seem like such a big event. It seemed like part of a larger flow of things, a larger, huge change that I felt was so obvious. So clearly I was aware of that but less aware of the kind of backlash that was happening, less aware of the way things were sliding in a different direction, because in particular I felt like we had won these battles. That is, women had won these battles in the '60s about not re-victimizing survivors of sexual assault. It seemed like we had taught judges and lawyers not to re-victimize survivors in the courtroom and we'd taught even newspapers and mass media these important lessons, and all of a sudden&#8211;. That's why I was so shocked last spring to realize all around me, on a public college campus, these things that I thought were history were very current in terms of re-victimization, and re-victimization by the people I least expected, the university staff. So back to this question, Title IX's forty years old, right, and the Clery Act is twenty years old, so it seemed like those broader kinds of shifts and broader kinds of education that had happened around sexual violence and about re-victimization, it seemed so sad and shocking to me that&#8211;. And apparently on lots and lots of public campuses and private campuses this is happening, this epidemic of rape culture is happening, and being permitted by administrators who'd rather sell their brand and keep things quiet rather than actually protect all students. I don't know, it just kind of&#8211;. [Laughs] I'm still shocked about it. I still don't have a way to make sense of all that, other than that I need to be more historical. [Laughs] I need to develop a better sense of how history changes and how&#8211;.

       "  'I had a godmother, a black woman, who was very much in her senior years. At that time seniors would be more than willing to take care of neighborhood kids. At the same time there were certain things that, if they felt like they had trust of other people who were around them, they just did. This person that\\'s in their family, they just know they can trust them. They would think that the perpetrators would be living down the street or homeless or someone who may have a mental illness or someone who is a substance abuser. So I was very much protected by the outside community, but as we know, in 2011, oftentimes the perpetrator is not going to be that same stranger from down the street or somebody that you just come in contact with. Sometimes and oftentimes it\\'s going to be someone that you know and someone who\\'s been brought into the family. When you look at some of the stories that Anne Rice [author of the novel, Interview with the Vampire] created for the New Orleans area and you look at the entr&#233;e of the vampire, [for] the vampire to come into a person\\'s home, that person has to open the door. The person has to open the door, and the same thing happened with me. By virtue of me not having the protective systems in place, the door was open for the vampire to come in. When the vampire comes in then, they prey. That\\'s what they do. So that\\'s exactly what happened. I was eight years old and it went on continuously, with this one person who was a relative of my godmother, for the next two years. So I suffered in silence, and to be very honest, at that age, the way that I rationalized what was happening\"I knew it was wrong\"but when I looked at the situation at eight years old and saw how me and my grandmother were living, which was not extreme poverty but still very low income to where we couldn\\'t afford certain services or health care or a car or air conditioning or things like that. Because she had to work so much to try to take care of our rent and she was often gone, [I was] in the care of the landlord sometimes, and the landlord was the relative of my godmother, and they had a son that was considerably older than me. He was already a young man when I was only eight years old. So by my godmother thinking that this family member was going to be someone that she could trust and that we could trust, oftentimes when she turned her back she put me in the care of him and delivered me right into the hands of the vampire. So that meant complete and full access. But because his father was our landlord, I felt the responsibility for maintaining our house was bent on me taking the responsibility for providing for the needs that he had in mind. Even though they were wrong needs, I still felt like it was my responsibility to keep a roof over our head, and so that\\'s why I didn\\'t say anything. That\\'s why I didn\\'t tell. CGD: So what happened to stop the abuse at ten? SG: He finally moved away. It wasn\\'t going to stop on its own. I didn\\'t have the wherewithal to stop it and I was too fearful to tell the family. For one, for fear of us losing our home, and number two, for fear of them not believing me. I\\'m this little biracial child who has extremely low value in the community as it is, so what value do I have? This is my thinking at eight years old, obviously, and so the only reason why it stopped was because he went to college. That was the only reason why it stopped. That was the only reason why it stopped, and I didn\\'t disclose it to my family on my mother\\'s side until I was getting ready to graduate from high school. There was a mental blockage of it for some number of years. Sometimes when children go through extreme psycholog[ical] trauma they block things out. They block out memories in their mind, and they\\'re blocked out for so long. As I began my teenage years, becoming a young woman, I think the way that began to manifest itself was in substance abuse. That\\'s how it began to manifest itself. It didn\\'t manifest itself in terms of sexual promiscuity by any means. I was extremely selective and very protective about that. In fact after the first time that I had sex with someone I went to my dad immediately and told him that he needed to get me on the birth control pill like tomorrow, because I\\'d just started having sex last night. After my dad passed out\". [Laughs] CGD: How old were you? SG: I was sixteen. I was sixteen years old and I gained strength sometime during that time frame, as I mentioned to you before, to confront my perpetrator. I found the strength to do that after I had enlisted into the military and I knew what I was going to do with my life and I felt empowered somehow. I saw him on the street one day. He came back and I saw him and stopped him, and I very boldly announced to him, \"You\\'re not going to do this again. You had the opportunity to do it without any consent from me whatsoever, but I\\'m sixteen years old now. It\\'s been eight years; I dare you to try now. I dare you to try it now. I\\'m taking everything back and I\\'m not going to be silent anymore. I\\'m going to start telling people about it, and you can call me a liar if you want to but it\\'s the truth. I\\'m not going to allow you or any other man or any other person to silence me again and take my liberties from me. I\\'m going to always put that in the forefront of my agenda from now on, so thank you for that.\" Right after that is when I decided that I wanted to start having consensual sex, and so again the early feminist in me decided to choose my own partner. I chose my own partner. It wasn\\'t someone I was in love with, it wasn\\'t someone that I felt very intimately about or was in love with or had any kind of romantic relationship [with]. There was someone that I thought would be the best fit for me, no pun intended. So I went up to my male friend and said, \"I\\'m ready to have sex tomorrow, and if you\\'re ready, let\\'s get condoms and let\\'s go.\" He looked at me and said, \"Well don\\'t you want the sweet romantic stuff and the candles and the soft music and the Keith Sweat playing in the background?\" I said, \"Keith Sweat is not needed. I\\'m ready to have consensual sex and either you\\'re going to be my partner or I\\'m going to find somebody else,\" and he said, \"Okay, well I guess I\\'ll go ahead [Laughs] and get myself together.\" So that was yet again another instance of being sexually liberated, even outside of being a survivor of child sexual molestation. I was able to yet again find a way to empower myself and take control of my sexuality, and my health also by going to my dad and announcing to him very strongly and boldly, \"I need to be on the pill and I need for you to take me. You haven\\'t done anything else for me. I need you to do this. At least protect me from having children that I know I can\\'t take care of.\" My grandmother was completely against the idea of me being on the pill because she was Catholic and so she was very much a conservative[ly] minded woman from the standpoint of family planning and pregnancy prevention. So I went to somebody who I knew would say yes. I cornered him [Laughs] into saying yes. So that was my upbringing, coming up as a young woman.',\n",

Once they understand the intersection of all that and see that human rights is at the core of all of it, it makes sense for all of us to be on the same team. The opposition is not able to do that. For one, they\\'re basing their argument on a single issue situation, they\\'re basing so much of their messaging around abortion, but if you\\'re talking about leaving women with no opportunity to make choices, it\\'s not just about abortion. It\\'s about preventive means and having access to that. It\\'s about what happens if this is a young girl who\\'s been raped. What happens if this is a trans-woman who needs services? What if this is even a male who needs reproductive health services from a fertility standpoint? So SisterSong is a collective, and as our framework we really don\\'t look at any single sex issues. We look at all issues that are impactful, that means all reproductive health issues, so I look at what I call the trinity: Reproductive justice, in terms of the movement building, there\\'s reproductive health, in terms of making sure that reproductive health services are accessible, affordable, and available to women, and then there\\'s the reproductive rights part of it, to make sure that policy understates that.

You have to remember that even though we are a tribe and of a sovereign nation we live the same way as everybody else does under the same dominant Western values, and that to me I think is what is really difficult, because when you try to apply tribal ways and values and beliefs it's conflictual with Western values and beliefs. So either you adopt one or the other or you try to blend them together and it's very difficult and complicated in a sense. But we have a lot of our women that get sexually abused. We have a lot of domestic violence. When you look at the statistics it is two and three times higher than the national average. We can't even get the protection until President Obama signed the Tribal Law and Order Act, and that is so that more and more protection will be provided to the Native Americans. I don't know the exact statistics but I think when they did the ceremony, when he signed it, the woman that spoke and told a bit of her story there at the press conference, it's three out of five women will be sexually assaulted and raped throughout her lifetime and a high percentage will experience domestic violence. It's horrendous. I think Lyndon B. Johnson was the one that called us the invisible people. In my opinion it hasn't been until Obama came into office that we have ever been acknowledged on the national level by our President of the United States.\",\n",

They were not allowed to wear any of their traditional clothing, their hair was cut, and for many Native Americans that act alone is an indicator that someone has died, and so when they were forced to cut their hair then a lot of those children would mourn because they thought that a death had occurred. They were forced to wear uniforms. The mindset was that the indigenous people of the North American continent, all Native American tribes, were not intelligent enough to become professionals, so the females were taught to be seamstresses, maids, of that nature, you know, laundry workers, and of course the male students were trained to be laborers and carpenters',\n",

So we\\'ve addressed the law enforcement piece, but I think now it\\'s time to address the larger sort of social response to gender based Violence and start to ask a whole new set of questions.',\n",
       "  'And so it\\'s kind of amazing for me that this is 2013 and we\\'re fighting these battles over sexual Violence against women, physical Violence against women, women\\'s reproductive rights. I mean women are still by a sigm...\\x81cant portion of the population regarded as inferior to men, and I just wonder linguistically what do we have to do to address this. What\\'s it going to take? How many dead women do we have to pile up before we realize that we\\'ve got blinders up or we\\'ve got our fingers in our ears and we\\'re saying la-la-la or both? I guess after all these years working with battered women and seeing the challenges they face that are, the initial source is the abuser. But then the state and the various agencies and institutions that she has to interact with to try to get Interview number U-lOO4 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill Gruelle 12 help, it\\'s like they drive the getaway car. The abuser commits the act, and then the state allows him to get away with it. So I really don\\'t know what it\\'s going to take. I hope the film is going to make people stop and think and say, \"I wonder what goes on in my community. I wonder how battered women are treated in my court. I wonder how the prosecutors handle these cases. I wonder if law enforcement treat these crimes seriously. I wonder if DSS [Department of Social Services] is punitive towards the woman rather than towards the abuser.\"\\x9d',\n",
       "  'KG: Well, I\\'m a big reader too. But I think documentary film can bring people together. I know what a profound impact Eyes on the Prize had on how people thought about ciVil rights work. The film that just came out The Invisible War about sexual assault in the military had a big impact. So there have been, documentary films throughout my adult lifetime that--I don\\'t know there\\'s something about hearing something come out of someone\\'s mouth combined with sort of the contextualization of the issue in a way that people who don\\'t do the work can\\'t see. Like in Deanna\\'s case, the woman who\\'s in the film, you see her photographs because I take her pictures to the medical school because I taught at the med school for twenty-one years, and I would hold up Deanna\\'s photograph, and I would ask the medical students what they thought Robbie was charged with. And universally they said this is an attempted murder case. And when I\\'d say to them, \"No, actually he was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault on a female.\"\\x9d And it just made their jaws drop because people just don\\'t understand what our laws do and do not say about gender based Violence. So I think doing a documentary film is going to make people, they\\'ll see the images. They\\'ll see what the laws say. They\\'ll see how our state, how the state of North Carolina just shrugged its shoulders and continues to shrug its shoulders around this crime, and maybe it\\'s going to led to an honest and open discussion about patriarchy, about misogyny, about what our laws re...‚ect, which is patriarchy and misogyny. And then these legislators who claim to care so much about the fiscal health of this state will realize that when they turn their backs on battered women and children, we\\'re going to pay for it sooner or later. They\\'re going to pay for it horrendously, but we as a state will pay for it too. So that\\'s why to me documentary film, it\\'s just so, it\\'s so important to do it this particular way.',\n",

What\\'s interesting is that pre the RJ [reproductive justice] movement I think many of us who started to get our chops in activism and organizing start from anti-violence work, especially domestic violence and rape, because it\\'s really one of the only politicized spaces where you can really center women\\'s voices. But we\\'re also centered in the victim role, right, so it\\'s not really how we\\'re organizing and mobilizing proactively. However, I feel like the domestic violence and anti-rape work, there was always a part of, like not always responding to the immediate crisis but thinking, what are the things we need in our communities to end rape, and so I think a lot of us\". So I entered the world through domestic violence and anti-violence, especially domestic violence and ending rape work, and that\\'s still a really big piece of my passion [that] I think really connects to RJ like all the way, just a big connection.',\n",
       "  'PH: Right. I think several things become interesting around women\\'s bodies in general, is that people don\\'t understand what happens from, you know, dangerous contraceptives that are the choices people take in order to decide like how they\\'re going to protect themselves, to living in a rape culture where what we wear becomes the blame for what happens to us, to thinking that\"the idea that we\\'ve been socialized [to] all our lives, that prisons are here for a reason and bad people go to prison. I think because black folks in particular have been really hit with the explosion of the prison industrial complex and the over-imprisonment of our people, we know that that\\'s not the truth, that people are being locked up for social problems. Instead of social problems being fixed, prisons have become a solution to fix social ills when the fact is that when you have poverty and these systems of oppression of place and not the willingness to really deconstruct and smash them prisons will only be places to hold people, and it doesn\\'t work. I think it\\'s hard because it\\'s ingrained that prisons are for bad people. It do\\ns make it a hard story to have people understand, that no matter what people\\'s situations, no matter what they\\'ve done, people don\\'t deserve inhumane treatment. That we have to agree that a pregnant woman having a belly chain at nine months around her belly and around her ankles and wrists is too much. Women, when we\\'re telling our stories, you need to believe us, that, \"It hurts, it\\'s inhumane, it shouldn\\'t happen,\" should be enough. We are in the fifth year of this campaign to pass our bill. We finally got our bill introduced earlier this year. It\\'s HB653. We\\'re going to be pushing hard on it in the 2012 session to really get it passed and make Georgia one of the first Southern states to ban the practice. It\\'s super important that it happens because whether it\\'s a thousand or one it\\'s too many, and it\\'s so vitally important that women say no, that this is not okay. That should be enough, but unfortunately that\\'s not where we live. That\\'s not where we are.',\n",

I knew that I was stepping into something that I couldn\\'t come back from, but I didn\\'t know quite what it was. I called a friend who taught Sunday school with us and I said, \"You\\'re a deacon, you do something about it.\" He goes, \"Well, I thought it was all dealt with.\" I said, \"I\\'m sorry, you claim that you believe all this stuff in the Bible.

He said he wouldn\\'t do it again, but my husband and my friend\\'s husband were worried that we were going to get in trouble, we were going to get sued, and I can understand why they felt that way. So they asked us, in the incident that happened at that church, not to write about it directly, so we did a series called \"Leaving Wonderland\" and we wrote about what happened but gave names to the characters, like \"Alice\" and so forth. EF: Sure. DP: The church was mad at us, they actually got some lawyers, however Jeff Anderson, who is&#8211;. If you look him up on Wiki he\\'s the one responsible for most of the settlements against the Catholic Church. He heard about what we did and he called me, he called and talked to me on the phone, and he said, \"I just want to let you know, they can throw you out of the church but they can\\'t bring you to court. You\\'ve done nothing wrong. If you need me, I\\'ll fly in and tell them.\" So he then helped me to understand what I can say and what I can\\'t say. EF: Sure. DP: So we began writing, we wrote about that. Then Mark Driscoll&#8211;. EF: And this is the Wartburg Watch, right? DP: Yes, and we named it after the castle that they had Martin Luther in when the pope was trying to&#8211;. EF: And what year did you begin this? DP: 2009. EF: Okay. DP: And nobody read us at first, except for people affiliated with the church who wanted to see if they could get any dirt. EF: Right. DP: We were very careful about what we said. But we also didn\\'t like a lot of other people. Mark Driscoll was very famous, Mars Hill, and if you look at him, he just had to step down, but he was big. We wrote [about him and] we called it \"Brother Mark\\'s Traveling Sex Show.\" He came here to UNC campus and we wrote about&#8211;. I mean, he\\'s pretty gruesome, and I don\\'t&#8211;. It\\'s almost hard to talk about some of the things he said as well, about women, as really&#8211;. Well, I mean everyone\\'s written about it in the papers, in the New York Times. He called \"penis humps.\" EF: Wow. DP: Yeah. I mean this was stuff that was going on, and we couldn\\'t believe it because all of the Neo-Calvinist crowd, they were loving this Mark Driscoll who was into this manly stuff, and my friend and I, we\\'re no one. We\\'re just like average people. She has an MBA, by the way, from Carolina. We\\'re average people and we\\'re looking at everything we\\'re seeing, and we talked to some pastors at Southeastern, seminarians, and they\\'re saying, \"You don\\'t get it. We all support them and there\\'s something wrong with the two of you.\" Well, Mark Driscoll just stepped down, so maybe we weren\\'t so stupid after all. We\\'re average nobodies. So I said, \"Look, let\\'s get our thoughts out on the table. Let\\'s start writing.\" So the first year a few people trickled in. Well, we are still in absolute shock, because then people started sharing their stories. So we started posting their stories at this church and that church, and now, this morning, I had a little technical glitch and a guy in Perth, Australia said, \"I see your glitch. Here\\'s how you take care of it.\" I\\'ve got a guy in Perth, Australia, and there\\'s even a gal who works during the summer months in Antarctica who follows us, and we have people in England and Scotland who are regulars on our blog, and we continue to go after child sex abuse. This was a big deal for us and there are so&#8211;. Boz Tchividjian, who is Billy Graham\\'s grandson, he got into this too and he said that the evangelical church is in worse shape than the Catholic Church when it comes to child sex abuse, and he\\'s formed a group called GRACE which is exposing child sex abuse in the evangelical church. And he\\'s right, because if you look at the statistics you have like a billion adherents in the Catholic Church. If you look at it percentage wise we are higher than the Catholic Church when it comes to not handling child sex abuse, pedophilia, and so forth. EF: But Catholic abuses are much more in the media. DP: Yes, although it\\'s starting, because we now are&#8211;. We were very involved in exposing the Sovereign Grace Ministries sex abuse cover-up, which we believe is a cover-up, and it is probably the biggest lawsuit that has been brought against one entity within the evangelical population. We were writing about that right from the start as well. A group of families have brought lawsuits against Sovereign Grace Ministries and it\\'s going to be a long battle in the courts.',\n",

We should not have this man\\'s books in our bookstore,\" and he told them, he said, \"I\\'m not going to become a member of the leadership until you get rid of these books. I can\\'t in good conscience support this. To me child sex abuse is a horrendous blot on the church,\" and they said no, and in fact they push&#8211;. They quote C. J. Mahaney a lot in the services. So he said, \"That\\'s it, I\\'m out of here. I\\'m not going to be a member of this church,\" except he signed a membership covenant, and this is something that we talk about at length.

I was molested in the back of a church as a child by a person who then came out and spoke in tongues, and there was a message delivered. So you can imagine the stories that I told to myself, and this happened for a long time as a child when I would come here for summers. And yet something deep always wooed me to be healed. Whether it was walking by the rivers or just quiet. I say I am as comfortable in a Holy Ghost-filled church service as I am a camp meeting, as I am an ashram as I am with my Jewish friends at synagogue, as I am on my patio because it\\'s not about the process or the path to that place. It\\'s about the place itself. And so that\\'s what I find is so interesting about me then coming back here and helping build these bridges between in these different places. Because as I was going through my own healing process I can remember what it was like for me to break away from what I had been taught traditionally and how it was so deeply disturbing that many times I called out, \"Please help me to understand.\" Because some of the things I now believe I was taught back then were evil. And yet there was something deep inside me that was stirring me, and it didn\\'t feel bad; it felt good, and so I would cry out and again the chills of, \"Help me understand.\" The words of \"I am the same God\" keep coming to me all the time. They get dropped in my spirit. \"I am the same God. I am the same God.\" So I live and operate from that place and offer that to those who are open to hear it because there are some we know will never be swayed. There are some who are looking for help out of that thing because they\\'re having questions too. And there are some that are like, \"Oh yeah, I\\'m there.\" So I work in the \"Oh yeah, I\\'m there and I can be swayed,\" and the rest--that might be the next generation\\'s work or they may never be or they might be the thing against we have to push so we get our chrysalis muscle. I don\\'t know, but I try to stay in that space and have enough courage to speak my piece, but most truth and most love is really important to me versus taking a bat and trying to shatter people\\'s belief systems. Because I felt my own cognitive dissonance, and I was being wooed out of it because of my own pain.

Even now I feel I know I'm reckoning with things and that reckoning I use to have compassion and empathy for what others must be going through and at the same time know we can't stay stuck there. That is the path. That is the journey. That is the role, to continue to move beyond that in ways not just numbly, blindly saying it's okay. But finding deep forgiveness. And forgiveness does not have to mean restoration. We don't have to allow that to occur again but [we have] to move beyond the stuck places.

At the rape crisis center I worked with a woman who had been doing this for I can\\'t tell you for how long, and I mean she could tell some real horror stories about working with law enforcement and kept working at it and working on it. And when I left there, I was involved in several trainings with law enforcement where a domestic violence or a rape crisis advocate and police officer would co-train other police officers, which was huge to see that happening, and it wasn\\'t just I would get up and say, \"This is who I am and what I do\", but we went back and forth with slides and exercises and answering questions, so that was a huge step, but again I\\'m fortunate that I didn\\'t have to get to that point. I picked it up at that point. Again [I was] fortunate in Arizona because I worked for a police force that had a whole separate domestic and sexual violence unit, whole separate building, specially trained detectives, so court--, advocates were right there. Sometimes we went onsite when a crime occurred. If not when they brought the victim back to the center, we were right there. So definitely an increased opportunity to get involved early on rather than having to wait later and having an officer realize, \"Oh, I guess I probably should call someone.\" This is more, but even there, there were still officers that didn\\'t believe victims or didn\\'t understand why she didn\\'t want to report and or didn\\'t, would question why she stayed for so long. The positive part of me was it was a great opportunity to remind those officers about why someone would say or why they wouldn\\'t want to report or why they didn\\'t want to go forward or why they dropped protective order. All the \"why\" questions we could spend some time on.',\n",

They don't want to come forward and tell their story, and for law enforcement it's important to hear from the victim because that helps them to make their case to make an arrest and possibly prosecute.

       "  'I was lucky to be in Washington, D.C. that had a growing feminist movement. The D.C. Area Feminist Alliance was getting off the ground. The D.C. Rape Crisis Center was the first rape crisis center in the country and it was founded in 1972. So there was a feminist bubbling in the atmosphere in Washington, D.C. in those times so it wasn\\'t\"I mean we didn\\'t have Google to do our searches for us [Laughs] but if you paid attention and were conscious you could find stuff. CGD: And was that D.C. feminist movement\"? Did it reflect the racial diversity of D.C.? LR: No, because D.C. at the time was eighty percent black and there were those of us who\\'d go to the DCAFA meetings\"like I said, the D.C. Area Feminist Alliance, we called it DCAFA\"but we were never more than one, two, or three voices at a meeting out of say fifteen, twenty people. But at the same time I really admired the working class consciousness that the white women had. I mean the way we all got jobs at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center was that it was a group of six white women that founded it, out of a hotline basically, but they made a commitment that whenever they got their first grants to pay salaries they were going to hire women from the community, which meant black women, and even though they were working class white women themselves who needed jobs\". I mean they were not wealthy women. One was a carpenter, one was a telephone operator. They could have easily done what most cities did and reserved the jobs for themselves but they made a political and philosophical commitment to hire black women with their first grants, so Michelle Hudson became the first executive director of the Rape Crisis Center, then [Akinje 1:05:46] became the second, and I became the third. So the D.C. Rape Crisis Center just became a hotbed of black feminism because of that, so I\\'ve always felt that books should be written about those six white women, because they did something that no other group of white women in any other part of America did, which was grandmother and foment the leadership of black feminism as an intentional project. We were so lucky to be in Washington, absolute lucky. CGD: So it was Rosa Carpenter, and who else were some of the other women? LR: Rosa Carpenter? CGD: I thought you just said Rosa Carpenter. LR: No, I said one was a carpenter. CGD: Oh, okay. LR: She was a carpenter. Deborah Freeman was a carpenter. CGD: Oh, okay. Are some of those women still alive? LR: Mary Alice [1:06:36]. I don\\'t know if they are or not. I\\'m sure Deb Freeman is because I think I saw something from her on Facebook. [1:06:45 Akinje] would know because she stays in more frequent contact because she\\'s still in D.C. and I\\'m not, so she would know. She stayed at the Rape Crisis Center for fourteen years\"I stayed for three\"because even after she stepped down as ED she stayed on as program director under me and then under two more executive directors, so she would know more about it than I. CGD: So did working with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center help move you to later, like your work with NOW? LR: Yeah. Well that was my first formal job in the women\\'s movement.

       "  'My mother was extremely repressed sexually and I did not understand why, but what was commonly known was that my brother, her last child, was born in 1955 and she stopped having sex with my father then and they still remained married until they both died. We didn\\'t properly understand why and as kids you don\\'t actually peek into your parents\\' sex life, but when I got the job at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center\"and therein is a story\"that\\'s when my mother felt that I was the child to entrust her history to. I had been there a couple of years before she opened up to me, just surprisingly on one phone call. She just said, \"Loretta, I\\'ve never told any of y\\'all this but I need to share this with you.\" I said that we were a farming family and one of the characteristics of a farming family is that multiple generations live in the same house, and so my mother had been sexually abused\"and her sisters, by the way\"by an uncle, and for my mother it happened from age eight to age sixteen when she got married to leave home, and that created a lot of sexual trauma in my mother that she never had any counseling for and healing from. The uncle ended up being in prison in a mental institution until he died, and even before my mother told me the story we got this notice saying Uncle Eli has died, and all the kids said, \"Who is Uncle Eli? How come we\\'ve never heard of Uncle Eli? We know Uncle Jim, we know Uncle Eskie, we know Booker T.; how come we don\\'t know about Uncle Eli? How did we miss this uncle?\" My mother said, \"Oh, he was one of Big Mama\\'s children,\" and that\\'s all she said about Uncle Eli, and nobody went to his funeral or anything. So Uncle Eli was like the big mystery but we weren\\'t curious enough to try to follow it up. Well it turns out Uncle Eli was the uncle that sexually abused all the girls in the family. So Mama never had a healthy relationship around sex and sexuality, and then when I became pregnant through incest, through a cousin, my mother went ballistic. She actually beat me for being pregnant. She was not healthy around sex and sexuality. I could never under\". And she did some really predictable but what seemed to be bizarre things at the time, like every time my father would take one of his daughters out\"and me and my father were particularly close so I hung out with Daddy all the time. I was Daddy\\'s girl. Daddy was the light of my life and I loved him to death. I know I was his favorite child and he knows he was my favorite parent, so there was no ambiguity at all about our relationship, but my mother would get so angry. I knew the minute I came home whatever I did it was not going to be right, and they believed in corporal punishment, so if I didn\\'t wash the dishes good enough that night I was going to get a whipping. It wasn\\'t until years later that I put together her fear around an adult male having a child outside of her eyes. My big sister told me, \"She did the same with me.\" She was just paranoid and it wasn\\'t until she told us her story, after we were already in our thirties [Laughs] that we were able to put all the pieces together, because what seemed to be craziness was actually PTSD. CGD: Were you able to tell your mother about the incest? LR: I had to. CGD: Was she able to hear it and process it? LR: [Pause] I\\'m not sure, because she got terribly re-stimulated by it. She had blamed herself for her own so she blamed me for mine. We actually agreed that I would go to a home for unwed mothers. CGD: How old were you? LR: Fourteen. CGD: Okay. So, I\\'m thinking about Rickie Solinger\\'s book about unwed mothers, of course later time period, and the argument is that basically in the \\'50s there are very few homes for black unwed mothers, so what was your experience? LR: It wasn\\'t a black home but I was the only black girl at the home. It was a home run by the Salvation Army in San Antonio, near Trinity University, over on the other side of town. The Salvation Army ran a number of these homes across America. A little bit more skirt to the story, I had already received a scholarship to Radcliffe and, trust me, having Melvin baby, was not how I planned on becoming a mama. I was not planning on being a mama. He was supposed to be babysitting me and he thought it was a better idea to have sex with me, and he was a serial abuser. That was one of the things that I really challenged within my family, how multigenerational the incest was, and yet we couldn\\'t talk about sex and sexuality, and I challenged that. The minute I became conscious of it I started introducing this very awkward conversation into our family. [Laughs] Whenever I see a young budding niece I go have a conversation with their mama, with my brother, whoever it was needed to have a conversation, and they would dread me coming, because I would say, \"You know what happened to me, you know what happened to Mama; we got to stop this in this generation here, okay? I don\\'t even know how far back it goes but I know it\\'s going to stop in this generation, and I will kill any of you that lay a hand on anybody and I find out about it.\"',\n",

They are intensely uncomfortable, for the most part, with how black women claim and redefine feminism for ourselves, and we intersect it.

I've been there for weddings, I've given speeches from the pulpit, I've been there for lots of funerals, but I've not been there as a worshiper since I was fifteen years old with a baby and I was accused of being the sinner when a twenty-seven-year-old had incested me.

If I wanted to talk about rape as something white men did to black women I could have had the Ida B. Wells story, but talking about rape as something that black men do to black women, it\\'s airing dirty laundry. So long before I started publicly talking about abortion I was committing the social faux pas of talking about rape and incest in the black community as something black people did to ourselves. I mean I\\'ve gotten booed off black stages and stuff, I mean stages at black conferences and conventions.

So Pamela has done all this research on abortion in the 1900s, and she came to me because we were looking for what kind of instruments would they have had and used and how would the abortion have been performed.

In Madison you could take shifts, and they would, you could be home, and they would forward the calls to your home. I would take it when Rebecka was napping. I went to Southern California and I was already seasoned. I got together with the most amazing women, and I'm still friends with a lot of them. The San Fernando Valley Rape Crisis Center was so pure that we wouldn't take money from any local municipal government, nothing. It was great because we could decide what we wanted to do. If a man called in those days, we had the name of a psychologist, a man, who dealt with either men who were rape victims or men who were trying to deal with their significant other having been raped. But we wouldn't touch them. I was not talking to a man because a lot of times they were just crank calls. On the other hand for a woman we believed everything she said. Whatever she said we were going to believe her. We were going to start from that point and we were going to validate her feelings because whatever you feel is normal after something like that. And so I did that for many years. LL: Was it hotline and did you have a center as well where people would come? PW: No, there's never a physical space. It was hotline, and you could accompany a woman to court and the hospital. It was a great experience\",\n",

       "  'Yes, she was, they mostly came out of the sociology department. There were a lot of women there, and then we fought for a women\\'s studies department, and there was also a women\\'s services. And this was the great struggle between academic feminists versus women who really did the work out in the community and on the ground. They often could not talk to each other. It was rough. I, at one point at Northeastern, was the chair of both of those boards. And I was fit and determined to get everybody to work together. LL: Can you say a little bit more about the divide? The other department was called women\\'s services? PW: Mm-hmm. LL: So which faction did that represent? PW: That was the rape crisis center counseling and\\nthe returning women and things that were really service providers, and they of course thought the academics had their head in the ivory tower, which they did a lot. As an academic, a lapsed academic, I can criticize, and I\\'ve seen that over the years in my political work here, these academics who teach public policy and sociology and politics, they have no idea what really goes on, and they don\\'t talk to the people who are actually working. LL: So was this department\"the women\\'s services department\"I mean was that, could you get a degree in that? PW: No, no, no. LL: Or it was just like a center? PW: That was on the student services side. LL: Right. Okay. I see. So they were working the rape crisis center. They were sort of doing the direct services, so to speak. PW: So there was this struggle between academic feminists and service providers. There was also a huge struggle between lesbian women and straight women. I identified myself for years as a political lesbian. For years I didn\\'t wear my wedding band because it gave me heterosexual privilege. And I\\'ll never forget this women philosophy professor. She was very radical, and she once said to me, \"I can\\'t trust you\"\"this was in a big group of women, straight and gay\"\"I can\\'t trust you because ultimately you will protect a man when it comes down to it.\" And there is nothing to say to that. There is a lot of mistrust. As you may know, the whole rape crisis movement was started by lesbian women, so too the domestic violence prevention. So they always thought they were the real feminists, and it was an interesting struggle to be right in the middle of. I\\'d like to think that I bridged some of that.',\n",

       "  'I finally did. I started out with skirts and blazers and that type of thing. I think about the ladies and they d dress all over the board sometimes. There are a few ladies who never wore anything but suits, and some are a little bit more casual. I won t tell you her name, but there was a representative who was elected, and she came up there and would wear a blazer, but she would wear these horribly, horribly derogatory t-shirts. They were derogatory against men. They were horrible, and she would come over to us and give us these cartoons that she had copied off 18 Finchum Coleman somewhere. They were horrible, and she would give those to us and say, These are just for us girls. And I m just thinking, Oh my gosh, and I m so dumb I never shared it with any of the guys. After the first year or the first legislative session, she learned because after that she started dressing very professionally. There are a few other people that noticed that, but it was very, very inappropriate. She finally started dressing very professionally and I realized, I need some suits. I ve been told the chamber is always cold. Oh, it s freezing and I would gripe like crazy about those fans and everything, trying to get them to turn the fans down, turn the heat up. In fact, I can even remember I don t know why I keep remembering Kevin Cox, but he went out to his car one time and got a blanket. It was horribly cold, and I guess it s to keep you awake some of the time. One thing I would like to say, just for posterity I guess it was difficult being a woman. It s difficult being a republican woman in the minority. One thing people need to understand is there were some guys out there that were horrible male chauvinists. I knew not to ever get near them and there was one guy I should have filed a sexual harassment suit against once because of his off-color teasing. I knew who I could tease with and who I couldn t, you know. I knew who I could come up and pat on the back and who I couldn t. But women are no different. I m not going to say names, but there was one legislator, she was young and to get what she wanted, she would go to the back of the chamber and hop up on the desk. She wore these real cute little short skirts and she knew what she was doing. She used her sexuality, you know. The men go about it a different way, but the women use their sexuality. I saw this particular representative several times embraced with men. I called it bear hugged, and she knew what she was doing. I thought, You don t need to do that. Then this other representative, she would file all these bills and we d kill them. Then she d come over to the guys and start rubbing her hands all over their backs and saying, If you d just let me bring the bill up for reconsideration if you ll just vote if you ll just give in to my let me bring it back up, and I ll take it back to committee, and she d just rub all over them, and of course they did it. She never did come up with decent bills, I didn t think. I d sit there and watch this going on, and I d go over and I d say, You are so pathetic you are so pathetic that you let her come over here and do this. She managed to get her stuff through. Most of the other women I don t think really did that. There s always a little bit of that feminine thing because we re women and we deal with things differently, but I remember those two. 19 Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman And then there are always rumors but it was difficult being a woman out there because you weren t in the in-group. Like I said at the beginning, I had to go and search out information because they weren t going to give it to me voluntarily. I think that s probably true of most of the women. We had to really fight. But for all those guys that were just horrible, there were some really good guys. I just thought the world of them and they understood that we were all equal out there. Since this is about women I think people need to know, that it goes both ways.',\n",
       "  'Is there anything I should ask you before I ask my last question? Oh, let s see. Anything else you want to cover? Did you have to have a new wardrobe to do this job?',\n",
       "  'No, because once Charley Gray taught me about roll calling a bill, I never went to the floor unprepared. I knew where my votes were before I got up, and one of my best friends in the House was a guy named Jim Glover who was from Elgin, Oklahoma. Jim was about 6 4 and weighed about 240 pounds, and we became great friends. I always enlisted his help. There were times when we couldn t agree on positions, but if Glover and some of those guys could help me on bills if somebody started to harass me on the floor, they d just stand up and move to advance the bill or to cut off debate. That just comes from those personal relationships. In fact, when I retired, they gave me a little award that said that I was the only member of the House that Jim Glover was afraid of.',\n",
       "  'Oh, sure. I don t even remember what the content of the bill was, but 9 there was an old gnarly guy named Bill Bradley who was the head of Banks and Banking, and Bill was about 157 at that time and he introduced me and said, you know, There s this little woman from Tulsa County. We re gonna let her talk about her bill before we kill it. Yeah and of course they did, so there were those kinds of experiences. One of the lessons that I learned from my husband was that I was not so much interested in whether my name was on the bill, but on what happened, and so there were a lot of pieces of legislation that I handled on the floor or I did the roll calls on because I cared about the topic. I worked on th\\n bill that allowed for prosecution of spousal rape. People do things to each other that frankly I had never heard of or thought about before I went to the legislature. And I worked on a bill that was a, rape by instrumentation. There were lots of bills that I worked on.',\n",
       "  'Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It s a huge difference. For a lot of those guys, they had never worked with women before. If they d been ranchers or they d been farming, they really hadn t had a lot of contact with women. We know that people tend to stay with things that they re familiar and comfortable with, and so there were men there who thumped the Bible and who said that they had a biblical entitlement. I ll never forget a senator on the spousal rape bill saying that if he didn t rape his wife, he d probably never have sex. We were doing a child support bill and a guy in the Senate was saying, Does this mean that, you know, if you have a one-night stand you re responsible for the child? I just can t imagine that, and I thought, You can t be that ignorant. But a lot of it was based on what I clearly believe is misinterpretation of the Bible and ignorance. So when people tend to hang out with folks that are just like them, they re going to hang out with other guys and to throw a woman into that mix, they re really uncomfortable.',\n",

       "  'Did you notice any difference in the culture between the men and the women on the floor and outside of the',\n",
       "  'Did you present any bills that you worked really hard to get passed and then they didn t?',\n",
       "  'Are there any other special issues you want to go over or anything that s happened? Yes, why not? (Laughs) Go to it. You can all read about someday what I did accomplish. Of course, when I first came up here my first goal was to finish some things that my husband wanted to finish his last term. He had just gotten reelected in 2002 before he became ill. And so one of the programs that took me two sessions to complete was the graduated driver s license for teenagers. He had worked on that for a couple of years so I worked on that pretty hard and we got that done. The other one is a trucking bill that he had and this is one I had a hard time following. (Laughs) So I at least got some other senators involved in it and we were able to get that done. It was to help get kind of a one-stop shop for truckers to get licenses and other things in one agency instead of spread out over two or three, which was just costly and time consuming. So they did get that done. Another group did that. A couple that I haven t finished yet, is on driver s license programs in public schools. We had them for years and now we ve quit having them, then they started coming back and then they re gone again. And that s because of the money and the driver s license education fund. I m going to try to work on that again this year because it s a reimbursement program. If schools don t get reimbursed sufficiently, they re not going to carry the program, pure and simple. So I m going to look at that. Another one that I ve started that Keith did work on some was trying to create a aging department to consolidate all of senior s services because right now they re spread out over six or seven agencies. That just doesn t make any sense to me. This is something very high on senior groups lists your area-wide aging, your silver-haired legislature and other senior groups, AARP, this is pretty high on their list. And so I ve had that bill up there for a couple of years and I m still working on it. I think we re going to see a little movement on it this year, I really do. We ve got some additional groups involved and interested and some more legislators interested in it too. Another one is domestic violence. I ve got a real passion for domestic violence as far as trying to do something about it in Oklahoma. It just gets me that it s still a misdemeanor for a first-time offense. And if anyone knows anything about domestic violence, you know it s happened more than once before it ever gets to court, before there are 20 Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich ever charges filed. It is a violent crime, first and foremost and yet we are not making that first-offense a felony. But yet we re filling up our prisons with all these non-violent offenders. I have a real problem with that. One of the scenarios I use is in Oklahom\\n it s a felony to own a fighting rooster or fight dogs but it s a misdemeanor to hit your wife. I am hoping in the time I m here, that Oklahoma is going to stand up and say, Enough is enough. That We re not having any tolerance for domestic violence. And help me push that through the legislature and get that done. In addition to that, it s important to also give some economic security to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. That s another bill that I ve been working on.',\n",
       "  '. Well, my first committee assignment was as chairman of the CareerTech Committee. That was a great experience because I learned a lot about that system and what a jewel it is in Oklahoma and how it s recognized worldwide. We have subcommittees now under the new leadership and regular committees, so CareerTech has been incorporated into the Higher Ed Committee and currently I serve on that committee. I chair the subcommittee on Children and Families. I also serve on Human Services and serve on the subcommittee on Criminal Justice. And I chaired last year the task force to stop sexual violence. And then out of the task force you usually come up with bills to present? Yes, and last year we came up with a bill that actually passed and is current law, which I m real pleased with, dealing with the CLEET Council on Law Enforcement Education and Training hours, the CLEET training hours, the police hours. What we found in the course of the task force was that police officers were not sufficiently trained in rape and sexual violence cases, and many times felt a little insecure going to those kinds of when they had to be called in to go to those 12 Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum Peterson Finchum reports. And so we thought, Wow, we can certainly improve that system by increasing the CLEET hours for sexual violence training. So we ve got, I believe, six hours now in addition to the CLEET hours that we have for all police officers in the state. I think that s a positive change. And we tried to get a coordinating council. There s some ongoing things that we re looking at that we weren t able to implement right away, but as you know, it takes years to make changes. It s a process. It s a process, yes, and I think it s important to keep that perspective.',\n",

During the days I was with the NAACP, I almost could bet you money on that, if they arrested a Negro, they were going to take him out on the outskirts of town somewhere first and beat him up, and then bring him back and throw him in jail. And hardly anybody ever was put in jail that came out without being beaten. And they always said they (cont) sometimes would have to tie their feet and hands and beat them down and all that to subdue them. But I never could understand how a man with his feet tied and his hands tied had to be knocked around They have stomped men in the jail that were accused of rape. They have taken men and women out on the outskirts of town and beat them\",\n",

Most of the cases were rape cases where white people used to become dissatisfied and disgruntled about a thing. The best way they could do, some white woman would holler that she'd been raped by a Negro or ventured to rape, or something like that, and of course that meant a burned or lynched Negro. And so this happened down at Conroe. But we were able to get a lawyer - this was one of NAACP's first projects - and a lawyer that won that case in our favor. And the day of the trial when he was declared innocent and turned loose, they shot him right in the jail house, I mean right in the courthouse down in Conroe, that's in Montgomery County. Well, those things were so exciting to me, I did not know that people could be treated like people in Houston were being treated. Not only in cases like that, but in jail, prisoners generally, why, they would beat up people and anything they wanted to do and kill people. And NAACP then became the sole interest of mine\",\n",

       " 'Can tell you what I know. And I can tell you how others felt. Marian Anderson, my friend, was not a race person. There were some of us who always lived above race. If anything was ever done because of my color, I don\\'t remember it. But I do know the facts and I\\'ll give them to you. These are facts from friends whom I know. There were within the race different colors of people and, because I knew some things that came to me from somewhere, that didn\\'t disturb me. If a person was very bright or he wasn\\'t so big and fat, you saw those persons on stage and you saw them on programs, even little children. The ones that were fat and ugly and dark -by some people they were not called upon. But the little light ones and the little pretty ones were. Now that was within the race. And it was true of grown people. But I hasten to say what I found out. When I found it out, I don\\'t know. As we were removed from slavery, you don\\'t find as many bright colored people as you saw 70, 80 years ago. All mothers during slavery who had bright children were not raped. They knew that if their children had a white father and if those children were light, they would have better advantages in the world. Many of the white men during slavery educated their children. Many of the women who had children by those white men were house servants. They had charge of that man\\'s house, all the cooking, all the cleaning. They even nursed the white woman\\'s babies. The white women were ladies. They did nothing but sit in the front room and dress and sleep. It was not until white women rose up against that, and told their men they would not allow them to accept these black women any more, that that was stopped. Now those of us who remember that are not as mad as perhaps those who think that all black women were raped. They were not. There are many bright colored people who were as close to their white parents as we are to our black ones. I am going to tell you about one, something that I know. I\\'ll name the place and the people who lived there would not object to it because they talked freely. When I taught at Snow Hill, Alabama, I had a friend, a young man, a friend in Dothan, Alabama, who was from Beatrice, Alabama. Beatrice, Alabama, is near Snow Hill. A friend in Snow Hill said she would take me to Longmire\\'s home. Longmire was then in Washington studying to be a lawyer. She says, \"I\\'ll take you to Longmire\\'s home. You can meet his people.\" She took us to Beatrice, Alabama. And we stayed in a home where there was a woman, a dark woman, and several bright men and women. We heard one fellow say, \"I\\'m going to get up and go to the big house and look after my father.\" This was as late as ...I taught at Snow Hill in 1924. And I asked, I said, \"Where did he say he\\'s going?\" They said, \"His father is white and lives in that big house up there.\" And his mother had every convenience that she could have, but they never married.',\n",

I did not fire the chief of staff; I placed them on leave pending the outcome of the investigation. It went to trial, they won. In other words, the chief of staff was upheld that there was no sexual harassment and all that, and she was allowed to come back to her job. But the person, one of the people associated with this, was also associated with a group of people at Chicago State. So, when this thing came up, all of this came back. They said, \"Hey, here\\'s this woman who let somebody who was accused of sexual harassment stay on her job. And she didn\\'t fire them and she didn\\'t do this, and she had drivers... and she did this and that.\" And all of that came up, and so there was a big whole negative thing.

Again, I liked the school. I had good professors at BU. But Boston itself was absolutely the most racist environment I had ever encountered. And I wasn\\'t prepared for it. Because like people who had spent all of their lives in the South, we were expecting by the time we get in a place like that... some other kind of freedom that you never experienced, you know. Speaker 1: Boston is the home of the Kennedys. Speaker 2: Yeah, you think... all of those things, okay. And you don\\'t think that you\\'re going to end up with \"Nigger, go home\" signs pasted all over your door, and pictures of guns and rifles, and your neighbors telling you to go back where you came from, and all those things that happened to me when I was there.

I lived on a street called Hemingway across the street from Northeastern Illinois University. Because there was-- Speaker 1: In Massachusetts? Speaker 2: In Massachusetts. Did I say Northeastern Illinois? Speaker 1: You said Northeastern Illinois. Speaker 2: Northeastern University. Speaker 1: In Massachusetts? Speaker 2: In Mass... in Boston. It wasn\\'t the BU neighborhood, but it was close enough. I could walk if I felt like a long walk, or I could take the streetcar and it wasn\\'t very far. It was something that I could afford that was, I thought, near my school. No one told me that I was the first black person to live in the building. Because I had no trouble at all renting it, I didn\\'t expect any problems. I looked at the place and I said, \"This is fine.\" I filled out the application, gave them the money, they rented it to me. No warnings. So, it was a big shock to me to have that experience. There were other experiences that I had when I was there. And so it meant-- Speaker 1: What are some of the things that happened? Do you want to talk about them? Speaker 2: I was followed... lots of things. I had... my sister in Detroit [Michigan] had to send me mace, because it was against the law to have it in Boston. But I felt like I needed something, because I was always afraid. You know, you know when you\\'re a student and you\\'re late in the library, and you\\'re coming home late and all of that--it was scary. And the people in my building harassed me quite a bit.

He was an alcoholic; at that time the church which was almost like a small cathedral, they had installed a mic [microphone] system because you couldn\\'t hear the Mass if you were in the back of the church, and when he would receive the Blood of Christ (laughter), the altar boy would, would tip you know the little cup. I think they used to drink Mogen David wine, I don\\'t know, and he\\'d, you know, pour the, the wine into the chalice and the priest would always--Father O\\'Grady would always hit the pitcher so that the altar boy would pour more wine in, and then he would drink it and I, I don\\'t know why nobody ever told him that when you drink and if you, if you sigh, we\\'re gonna hear it all over the church. He would drink that wine down and he\\'d go (makes sound).

We were very young and it could have been consensual, but I did remember saying, \"No.\" But, I don\\'t think my life right now, I would be where I am now if I had gone through with that because you can really hurt other people and I, when I talked to his parents, his parents was, you know, it, it could have gone any, any way. It could, it could have been that I could\\'ve agreed just by going into the room. It\\'s just so many ways that you can look at it you know. And I know back in that day, you know, rape, rape is rape no matter what. But I do not remember saying to him, \"Let\\'s go to the next step.\" But I did go into his dorm, so a lot of that weighted on that, you know, in my decision. And when I dropped those chor-, charges, those charges being dropped was weighted on the fact that I could mess up his life and maybe mess up my life as well. So I weighed it on that and we both live good lives now, you know. I, I, went on to graduate from college, he graduated from college, he lives a prosperous life. But you know those things would not be there for him. I remember going to the c-, the jail in Greenwood [Mississippi] and seeing him behind bars, you know, that, that left a mark on me because I, I look at it now and look at how the systems are set up, you know, it, it\\'s gotta always be a place where we can come and meet and say, you know what, I made a mistake, you made a mistake. And I think at that time I wasn\\'t smart enough, but something inside of me was smart enough for me to recognize that I did not wanna mess up his life because a mis-, a mistake that the two of us had made. So when I moved from that point to there--and I later on went on to, to date a professor (laughter) at the university so, it\\'s, you know, I, I had a really good life as, you know, as a, as a, as a student at the university.',\n",

You don\\'t know who you are at th-, at that age; you\\'re just trying to find out who you are and just trying to establish a personality for me. I just lashed out at everybody.

Speaker 2: And when I walked in there was one part that had like a screen you couldn\\'t see, like there was like a foot of air, and you could see a man\\'s legs there.

Her grandfather was a free man, I've seen his picture, very handsome; he looked Italian. And the two of them, well he was free and she was white and they got married legally. But things were getting very tough interracially so they went to Mississippi. I used to always wonder why didn't they go north. But they went to Mississippi where things were a little bit better, for a short time, then they got worse than Georgia. Mississippi passed a lot of rules that they called the blue codes and they were against interracial marriage and so forth. They, they took away the power of Reconstruction they nullified it and so all of the accomplishments that had been given to blacks or freedoms or rights that came with emancipation got vitiated you know. These two went to Mississippi and had four children. And as I understand Kelly was the only one who remained a Negro. The other three passed, and that's my understanding. And so my mother came--Kelly was her father--and I don't know beyond that. She has talked about her mother side, her mother was the child of a teenager, whose parents were very distraught because I guess she got raped by a white man. And they brought up the child and the teenage daughter died and that was my mother's mother. So when Mattiwilda [HistoryMaker Mattiwilda Dobbs Janzon] was born, my mother put the two words together Mattiwilda, you know.\",\n",

I asked him, I said, \"I really wanna go home, is there any way I could work for you.\" And so he made me visiting professor, of visiting scientist and I worked there for seven years. Speaker 1: What was your job at the CDC, what was your job at the CDC? Speaker 2: Actually I did a couple of things. Speaker 1: What is a visiting scientist (laughter)? Speaker 2: A visiting scientist gets plugged into different areas. And my job was to help him try to get other facets to CDC, to look at violence as a part of public health. Violence I think is a part of public health. You have morbidity, you have mortality and we can trace it, we can measure it. He was ridiculed for this The Wall Street Journal took him to task. And said, \"That\\'s not a public health issue, the doctor should stay with his medical thing.\" And of course I\\'m interested in human sexuality and pregnancy, and pregnancy prevention and HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and, and the stop of HIV, as well as all the sexually transmitted diseases.

The Scottsboro Boys [nine African American teenagers falsely tried and convicted for rape in Scottsboro, Alabama] happened when my father was growing up.

       " 'Speaker 2: I saw it. I dealt with it. I mean everything. When I first [1973] came into the [National Urban] League, at the Washington [D.C.] Bureau, people would not pay me any attention. When I succeeded Ron Brown, \"Don\\'t mind her. She\\'s too young.\" Ron Brown was one month older than me. But I seemed too young. There were you know, things said and things done that I addressed even to the point of telling one individual that I was going to hurt him because of his aggressiveness. And he didn\\'t believe me but I made it real clear. I said to him, I said, \"How will you explain to the folks downstairs how you got all those scratches on your face? \\'Cause I will hurt you.\" You know, sometimes I could be more bravado than there really is. But I was serious. But the point is that that happens. And some women can handle it and some can\\'t. I didn\\'t need a lawsuit. I didn\\'t need a newspaper story. I just needed this turkey to get it straight. That he was not gonna hurt me. \\'Cause I was gonna hurt him. But the sexism in the Urban League was rampant. When I was in the Washington Bureau [starting in 1991] one of the things that I did start talking about to our execs was sex harassment. And what that meant, and what that could mean to them. They used to make jokes. \"How you know how that feels? How do you describe sexism?\" I said, \"I--let\\'s put it this way. If that person next to you had done that or said that to your mother, how would you have felt? If it was wrong for your mother, then it\\'s wrong. If you can\\'t accept the explanation, put your mother, your wife or your daughter in the category. And if they--you would be offended if this happened to them, then it\\'s wrong.\" And then it was shortly after that, we had a male exec sued. Several male execs were sued subsequently. But right after that conversation. And then we had a female exec sued. And I began to talk about the fact that, \"Ladies it\\'s coming to you too.\" And you know, they were sitting back there so few in numbers, they didn\\'t believe this. But one of our female execs was sued for a sex harassment. And unfortunately I would say to them that, \"You know, it\\'s not what you\\'re doing, but it looks like you\\'re doing.\" And she would always take these nice young looking guys out for a drink after work. She thought that was nice. That was fun. \"Don\\'t do that lady. You\\'ve got to be careful. Don\\'t do that man. You\\'ve got to be careful.\" We had one person, his story hit the newspapers right after that. He was dating some woman on staff. And he didn\\'t show the night before because the wife had priority. And the woman had fixed his favorite food, which was spaghetti. She came the next morning with a pot of spaghetti and dumped it on his head. And that was the beginning. \\'Cause everybody called the press. The people that he was mad at on the staff, they called the press and told it. But, you know, some of these guys didn\\'t get it for a long time. But now I think they got it. I think they know, even though some one will--some will push the envelope, they know that this applies to them to. Not just to Texaco [now part of the Chevron Corporation] and Coca Cola [Company] and some of these other companies. It applies to you as well.',\n",

I mean, I did well at it, but then when I got to the senior level and I'd look up in the higher ranks, and I said, you know, I had this feeling of, you know, doing deals and, and being this power player in some corporate setting, but it didn't feel like finance and that wasn't it. But I--it was what I knew. So I stayed in it for a while, did a stint in HR [Human Resources], got recruited out for the people skill stuff. Someone said, well maybe you'd do well--maybe you'll like it over here, and I said sure, I'll give it a try. Love the people, not necessarily muddling in people's lives, you know, investigation, sexual harassment, who said what, who offended whom, you know, so on and so on and so on, a bit depressing.

I'm sure there are people who are so good at investigating that at the end of the day, they are confident. But after hearing all the stories, I wasn't sure where I stood on it. So I stayed there. We started a, a diversity group at TJX called--they're the--they're affinity groups.

I, I called Percy Sutton to simply just ask him could I join and go down with the group, but he said, \"No we don\\'t want any coverage you know, you don\\'t need to go.\" So, I went of course. So, it was so ugly. It was so--the minute I got to this diner. It was a diner, this diner refused to serve blacks, so three men were behind the counter. \"Y\\'all can\\'t sit here, we don\\'t serve niggers.\" So, it, it, it\\'s, it\\'s still shakes you up. You, you hear about it, you read about, but every time it happens it shakes you up again and say I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing. I can\\'t believe this is now, this is today. I can\\'t believe this kind of hatred exists. All of this goes through your mind, but here it is these terrible people. They knew in advance, of course, that the, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] leaders are coming down there. They didn\\'t know a female reporter was going to be there, so I\\'m sitting there and I\\'m really frightened \\'cause I\\'m seeing maybe for the first time the worse kind of hatred and anger and, and possible killing. I\\'m seeing this vividly, vividly, just by the language, the way they insulted, the things they said and how they said, the men behind the counter of the diner, which was--to these NAACP leaders, who were trying to be served. They, of course, the leaders all anticipated this. This was all done on purpose. They wanted to be arrested. They indicated a little surprise at me being there. They--I was not known as an NAACP leader and it soon, and they soon realized that I was a reporter and so they said awful dirty things to me very loudly. And we\\'re all sitting there, these, these insults are going back and forth, but we are waiting for the police to arrive that\\'s why we\\'re just there to arrest all of us. That was, that\\'s the idea. Speaker 1: You included? Speaker 2: Yeah. Except when they came to arrest everybody, one of the policeman reminded another policeman that the law, I believe, he said says that when a woman is arrested she must be arrested by a woman cop, which may or may not be true. I\\'m inclined to believe it is, it was true because what advantage would it be for leaving me there. But, they arrested the men and I was left there with these terrible men behind the counter. I think there were five of them shouting insults to me that I cannot even repeat. I, I\\'ve never been that frightened in my life. I, I was, and, and I\\'m wondering if they\\'re gonna rape me, \\'cause that was suggested as part of the insults they were throwing at me. I said are these four men gonna rape me? Are they gonna kill me, or is, is this woman police person whose gonna arrest me is she really gonna come? And I prayed quietly. I didn\\'t, I, I just prayed quietly, and, and was so frightened wondering could I withstand what I thought was gonna happen to me, could I try to kill myself. It, it was not anger that I had it was just plain fear, just plain fear, the worse kind of fear. Story_ID: 372504 Speaker 1: The woman cop came sooner than I had expected, thank God. Her name was Ms. Kennedy [ph.], Officer Kennedy. She handcuffed me, took me to the car, took me to jail, and put me in there. In those--I, I, I don\\'t know if it was five minutes or ten minutes or fifteen minutes that I just, I just had to sit there and hear all these insults being hurl, hurled at me and wondering---I really, I really was wishing for a way I could kill myself because I was thinking the worse kind of things, but none of that happened. God intervened and going to jail was a piece of cake you know, it was heaven (laughter). And they, we had a trial the next day. Speaker 2: Did you have to stay overnight in jail? Speaker 1: Um-hm. Speaker 2: We\\'re you the only female? Speaker 1: Huh? Speaker 2: You were the only woman. Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: Were you-- Speaker 1: I just stood up all night in some little jail. Speaker 2: So you had a trial the next day, okay (simultaneous). Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because that whole thing was at night. I don\\'t think it was a long night. The sit-in had started at night, so I, I don\\'t think it was a long night. I do know I just stood, stood there and held onto the rails and had the trial the next day which lasted about five minutes and we were all found guilty and fined a hundred dollars each. Speaker 2: What was the paper\\'s [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] response? Speaker 1: Hm? Speaker 2: What was the newspaper\\'s response to your being arrested and fined one hundred dollars? Speaker 1: They just did a straight story on it. I didn\\'t want it dramatized or anything. I, I, with me I, I don\\'t, I don\\'t, I, I wanted, I didn\\'t get killed, I didn\\'t get raped, the worse did not happen. With me I thank God and we don\\'t need to dwell on my personal fears. That, that, that to me--and, and what I was thinking was, was that I didn\\'t want to sound like a cry-baby woman reporter, you know, you get it. Yeah, so, so I had a rough day, but you know it\\'s over.',\n",
       " \"Speaker 1: And we were going to talk about because you, you, you carried, covered so many stories, you said you don't remember the details of them all, but there is one in particular that you really remember, and that's the one, the, the sit-ins, when the students were sitting in, and you had (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.

       " 'Speaker 1: Now what was the biggest challenge I guess at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] when you were there? Speaker 2: The biggest challenge. I guess the biggest challenge was probably changing the image in that people thought basically as a black school and not necessarily as a very good educational institution. So, you know, there always would be little snippets in the papers. Little negatives about, you know, that would it occur at [College of] William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia] that would never even hit the papers. But always if it was something related to Hampton, the negatives got in, and very few of the positives. You know if say somebody raped someone. Well even though the student might not have--or the person may not have ever graduated from Hampton, if they ever went there, in their lifetime, then, you know, it was mentioned as, \"Hampton somebody some--,\" you know. And so getting rid of the negatives related to the fact that this is a black institution and it\\'s mediocre. To the fact that it\\'s a great college education. It\\'s a great university education. Changing really the image. The papers now give the positive things that are happening. The entire perception of Hampton over the last twenty years has changed significantly. And I would say if you\\'re looking at HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] among the ones that have great reputations would be Hampton or Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] or Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].

When I tried--before I would ask what was this and they would not, never tell you because one thing they didn't want you to be afraid--those were some strong people. I was in college when I found out about this. That night, what had happen there was a black boy they were looking for--claimed to have molested a white girl and they came to the community. Now I'm talking about fifty or sixty Klansman and they had torches and they came knocking on doors and my daddy happened to go to the door in his pajamas or whatever he slept in. They brought him out on the porch and they surrounded him and they--men with shotguns and these torches asking him questions. They had him with his foot out looking at the bottom of his feet to see if he had been out. My mother went out there, stood in front of him and started screaming and yelling why are you doing this, who is this, what is this, my husband has been here with us, you are frightening me and my children, what is this and she would carry on boy. They finally said no let's leave him alone. I remember seeing those lights; I remember the noise, as I said vaguely. For years I asked my mother and daddy who was that, what was going on because I didn't know but they would never tell me until I got grown. My brother didn't even wake up. But they, that kind of thing they just never talked about. Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing you should never forget either. Speaker 2: Oh you don't. Believe it or not, really believe this or not when I started--when I get sick or something in the back of my mind I can just see that, I can see the lights. Do you understand what I mean?

And apparently, the Dixiecrats were running for office and so, immediately I got hit by this, you know, overwhelming white political power structure. Some blacks had started, I think, probably in the early 1950s running for office, but it was just a thing that people did with no hopes of winning. I think Dr. [Joseph E.] Walker had run for the school board and maybe somebody had run for public office of some kind and what not. But there, we became, my husband [HM Russell Sugarmon, Jr.] and I became very involved in the political campaign and then also in the struggle for civil rights. Immediately, we joined the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], starting going to meetings, the NAACP was being overhauled, it had very old non-progressive leadership. At the time we got to Memphis, which was 1956 a lot of northern educated young professional blacks were coming back to Memphis. There was Jesse Turner, who was the banker, who came from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]. There was A. W. Willis who came from Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan]. There was Russell Sugarmon, my husband who was from Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. There was me from Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts]. There was [HM] Maxine Smith who\\'d gotten a Master\\'s at Middlebury [College, Middlebury, Vermont]. Suddenly, there was Vasco Smith, who had gotten his doctor, D. D. degree. So, there were doctors and lawyers and people who, we were supported by the black community, you know; any time you have dentists, and doctors, teachers, nurses, whatever. Our financial support came from the black community, so we felt like we could afford to step out there, we ain\\'t had no money, but we had lots of umpf, lots of energy and we got involved in politics. Immediately, let\\'s see, Maxine and I had our babies. The next summer she and I applied to Memphis State University [later, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee], which had no, this is, this is 19--, let me see, I went there in 1956; this is 1957. The Supreme Court decision was 1954 [Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas (1954)], this is three years later. She and I applied, oh it created a furor, ahh the people were really upset. Finally, they decided we were not qualified, (laughter) in spite of the fact that I finished Wellesley, she had a Master\\'s, she said, \"I didn\\'t even want to go there.\" It was just something that, you know, we had to do; so we were unqualified. In the meantime I was getting nightly calls from people who said they were on the football team and if I came out there, they were come and rape me. My husband and I lived on Lenow Alley [sic, Place, Memphis, Tennessee]. His parents lived on Walker [Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee] right across from the college [LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee] and his father, bless his sweet soul, built us a little one bedroom, tiny little house on their back property, which faced onto the alley. So, one night we woke up and there was a gunshot through the window, people fired onto the thing. So, we were not afraid for ourselves, but we sent our kids, I sent-\\'cause I had two babies at the time and we sent them, the little girl up to Saint Louis to stay with his sister for a good part of the summer cause we were afraid for the children. So, you know, there were threats and what not. But we kept on, we were completely fearless. Then, in 1959 Russell ran for the County Commission [Shelby County Board of Commissioners], and all of us were really active; I mean door-to-door, campaigning, up late at night, up early in the morning, speaking in churches, rallying, just, we really just became caught up. Now, in that race we really did think blacks had a chance to win. Unfortunately, he was defeated and the other two, one of them was [HM Benjamin] Benny Hooks, one of them was a minister, Reverend [Roy] Love and so the three of them were defeated.

We thought, god, we\\'re singing with the Temp- they were fabulous. I mean, they were all tall and their choreography and their singing--they were wonderful as far as, you know, being entertainers. But, you know, I guess they were lonely, too, for family members and for friends. So, they threw me a birthday party, and we weren\\'t really doing anything, you know, but sitting there laughing and talking. Speaker 1: Mrs. Powell wa- wasn\\'t gonna have it? Speaker 2: Oh, she wasn\\'t gonna have that \\'cause she said Berry would have her head. Story_ID: 656603 Speaker 1: But, looking back at that today, I feel good about that--Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] cared enough, you know. I had the opportunity to talk to some of the other female artists, The Dixie Cups and some of the other female groups from back in, in that--in the day, and one of the ladies said--at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [Cleveland, Ohio], we all got together in a--in a suite one particular night just reminiscing, and one of the girls said she was raped. Somebody broke into her room and raped her (shakes head). Speaker 2: Now, this is somebody with another label? Speaker 1: Yes, another label. So, thank you, Berry. He took darn good care of us. He made sure nothing happened to us; and I really appreciate that today-- Speaker 2: Now-- Speaker 1: --at my--at my age, looking back on that.',\n",

We did what we called sock hops to promote the record. And then The Temptations had asked Berry [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] if we could open for them; and we think, you know, now that we're adults, they had other things in mind. Speaker 1: Oh, I see. Speaker 2: But then Berry knew that, too, so he sent Mrs. Powell [HistoryMaker Maxine Powell] with us.\",\n",
       " \"Speaker 2: I really like all the stories I do. I don't usually take them on if I don't like them. I think that there is a pattern in which I look at issues that affect vulnerable people. The women at the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District [of Greater Chicago], for example, talked about being sexually harassed, there were bomb threats. There were all kinds of issues with them when they spoke out with me, but change occurred somewhat. And there was education that occurred, and women tell me that their working conditions are there are better. We went undercover there to prove that this was going on, and that there was a hostile work environment. We went undercover at Ford Motor Company [in Chicago, Illinois] when the women there came to me to complain that they were being treated in a hostile way, and we found evidence of quite a hostile work environment. Lawsuits were filed. The women recovered money. You know, so again working conditions hopefully are better as a result of the work that we did. And I get thirty calls a day from people who have real, serious problems or from whistle-blowers who want to tell about issues that are going on, and want to tell about how government isn't doing what it is supposed to do, or how they are being defrauded by the private sector.\",\n",
       " \"Right now, I have just exposed the story who is in her twenties who has been in a vegetative state and had been in a nursing home since she was three months old, and she cannot walk, she cannot talk, she is fed with a feeding tube, she has a severe seizure disorder and her mother called to tell me that the girl was seven months pregnant. I went to--(simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: --Wait a minute--wait a minute--she has been in a coma since she was three months old? Speaker 2: Three months old. Speaker 1: And she's pregnant. Speaker 2: She is now having a baby. We will be there for that and she is in a facility, that I looked up, that has had massive problems of neglect, and abuse, and children drinking detergent and one boy whose genitals were found cut and sliced, and the place seems to be a real hellhole for the most vulnerable, our children, and yet they get paid ten million a year from the government. Why is nothing happening to improve conditions there or close them down? That's my question--how can someone be seven months pregnant when the records show that the doctor was there every month to examine her? Where were the nurses\\nto check on her menstrual period? And who impregnated her? All a big mystery at this point, but I did the story, and then it was picked up by The Washington Post and nationwide because this is a story of the most vulnerable of us, and again she cannot speak, but I can. Story_ID: 156078 Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about the highlight of investigations here, and that, that serves as an unusual story (unclear). Speaker 2: It is, but I think it is not as unusual in occurrence as we might think. I just think that it's usually covered up or an abortion occurs, or something like that. Speaker 1: You did a positive thing. You uncovered it and possibly saved other people from this anguish and problems. Speaker 2: Well, look at the mother--the girl's mother who now has to think of raising a child, a baby, a child of rape. I mean there are just so many issues, and these issues are in our society, but this is a person who is very, very vulnerable and who was taken advantage of, who was raped. Legally, the investigators, the police are looking and hoping that through DNA, after the baby is born, they will find the person who sexually assaulted this girl. She can't speak.\",\n",
       " 'Speaker 2: Well, you know, basically when someone calls me, I check them out and there\\'s not very much that I haven\\'t heard of or seen and so I just know how to track things down very quickly, and I sometimes do not have any evidence. For example, the story that I just told you about happened at a place called the Alden Village Nursing Home in Bloomingdale, Illinois. Actually, three years ago, someone called me with a similar complaint of sexual abuse, but I couldn\\'t prove it. It never was proven, so I put it in my files, and when I got this call this time, I went straight to that file and I said, \"Now, this is call is pregnant. That\\'s real evidence.\" So the story I wasn\\'t able to do back then, now I can go and pick that up, and do it. In addition, I know how to gather the records from the Department of Public Aid, the Department of Public Health, and to find out what investigations have occurred from Medicare and Medicaid. All of these are public records that you can obtain from the Freedom of Information Act. Any citizen can do it, but I do know how to do that, and I fight with government almost every day to obtain records.',\n",

Catherine and Edda were two and four when I started in 1974, and they have certainly been very much a part of everything that I do. I use to drag them to meetings and never thought that they were paying attention to anything. And I was very surprised when Edda was at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia]--well Edda got to Emory because I had gone to Emory for certification archives administration. Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: And she--and they lived on Spelman's [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] campus. So when it was time for them to go to college, I just assumed that they would both go to Spelman. And Catherine didn't really care one way or another and so we got her application to Spelman and she was fine. The little one, no, I don't want to go there. I want to go to the other school that you went to. And I guess she thought I had gotten a master's [degree] or something there. She didn't know what I had done there but she knew-- Speaker 2: Right. Speaker 1: --I was there. Didn't want to go to the same school as her sister and so wound up going to Emory University. And the first two or three weeks that she was there, there was a rape and there was a racial situation and immediately she turned to the black students because both she and her sister were graduates of Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart, which was all-white in Coconut Grove [neighborhood in Miami, Florida]. Speaker 2: Oh. Speaker 1: So this was really--she had not had that much contact with black students in school. But this racial incident was something that really, really concerned her and she decided that she was going to find out more about black history because she hadn't been very interested before to put it mildly.\",\n",

       " 'Speaker 2: I think we\\'ve given women a voice. I think that we are not afraid to talk about spousal abuse. We talk about rape, incest, things that brothers have never touched. I think that the women preachers, the woman preacher, has brought to the forefront some issues that were pushed to the back in our writing, in our preaching, in our programming. I just had a women\\'s conference over in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. And I talked about--you know, we had classes on things like childlessness, raising children, overcoming divorce, getting rid of the anger, getting rid of the bitterness. I feel that ministry to women is what my generation in particular--Vashti [HistoryMaker Bishop Vashti McKenzie], Cecelia Bryant [Cecelia Williams-Bryant]--I think we have been very, we have been the trailblazers. And I hate to say it, because I\\'m not tooting my horn. But we have been the ones who have helped women deal with their issues, their feelings. We\\'ve not been afraid to talk about it, and we\\'ve not been afraid to deal with it, to help women to express themselves and hear what they need to hear in order to overcome divorce, in order to overcome years of rape or incest. We\\'ve not been afraid to do that. And I think that that has helped. One of my things about women\\'s ministry and the ministry to children--I wanted to do a real strong prison ministry. And I brought a man in from the prison system, and I don\\'t remember his name. But he said, \"If you really want to do prison ministry, you need to start at school. If you really want to do prison ministry, you need to deal with women.\" He said, \"Because if you can have children in a safe and positive environment, and then if you can help heal their mothers, then you will impact the prison industry, and it is an industry.\" So, that stuck with me. And I do feel that in healing and ministering to women, I\\'m helping the children. And I, of course feel that the Allen Christian School [Queens, New York] is an environment in which children are steered toward positive living and toward college. And so I think that those are two critical, critical, areas that my generation, especially with the--you know, I\\'ve been having women\\'s conferences for twenty-seven years, for twenty-seven years, dealing with those kinds of issues; helping women to heal, helping women to be focused, helping them to see themselves as overcomers and victors. And every year I get feedback on Facebook, you know, \"Life changing, I\\'ll never be the same.\" And that\\'s what you want.',\n",

       " 'In regard to DCFS, the Department of Children and Family Services, I was just at awe one day to realize how many children were coming into the system and were wards of the state [of Illinois]. Now mind you, when I was growing up, if \"Sally Sue\" wasn\\'t at home with her babies, it was just somebody\\'s responsibility on the block. We, somebody was going to take care of those kids. It was no such thing as calling somebody or sending some child away. It was a community effort to raise children. It was a village. It took all of us. But there appeared to have been a new-found method, in my opinion, of creating dollars to bring to the state and that was to get children, because drugs, drugs was becoming rampant in our community and a lot of families were falling apart and so we started reading about horrible things, women burning babies and throwing babies out the windows and father sexually abusing children and selling their babies for dope. It was just a horrible situation. But if that wasn\\'t bad enough, once they get into becoming wards of the state, they were once again in some cases sexually abused and misused and some kids were being sent to five and six and twenty different homes and each home they went to, it was worse than the other, they was further being, they were sexually abused at home with their biological parents and now there\\'s these foster families. They were being sexually abused and there were other siblings there, other children there, that is not of the same family and each is sexually abusing each other and it was just a horrible, horrible situation and it was making me sick. I looked at the system and I said to myself, \"Something is wrong here.\" There was no continuity. There was no way that families were really getting back together, there was no closure in what happened to the child. We were raising children to become greater predators. We were having them to leave DCFS [Department of Children and Family Services] and to become wards of the state again for the Department of Correction and it was a vicious cycle that, to me, that needed to be broken.',\n",

Or did you see, did you notice any difference in-- Speaker 2: Not in terms of the crime rate or the police department. Because remember, the city of Chicago is one city within the County of Cook. And so, the State's Attorney represents the County of Cook. And so, you're talking about crime across... over a hundred municipalities. So, the State's Attorney was always very strict in terms of the way the State's Attorney's Office was laid out. Only the first chair in a courtroom--meaning the most senior State's Attorney in a courtroom--could determine the level of plea bargains in certain kinds of cases--crimes of violence, murder, rape, home invasion. That was when the law changed as well, to make it a Class X, so those crimes got greater penalties and no probation, which meant those cases had to be tried. So, that whole law and order mentality made for a more tense time, because you had cases that suddenly--where maybe you could have plea-bargained for something less than prison time--now automatically carried a prison sentence. So, unless the State's Attorney was willing to reduce the charge, you were going to be going to trial on these cases, because there was really no alternative. So, you didn't sense a change, in terms of the way the police or the State's Attorney dealt with crime. You simply saw under Harold Washington a greater awareness about how it was impacting minorities.\",\n",

When I began my gender explorations, I actually began by looking at what feminist were doing--some of the issues that feminists were raising in theology. So I was looking essentially at feminist theology. But as I was studying the work of feminist, you know, tensions of theologians, you know, I was increasingly struck by the lack of me, the lack of my presence, you know, the lack of African American female presence as I studied feminist analysis, the whole notion that women's experience has been ignored historically in the doing of theology and in the doing of any other disciplines as well and the notion that women's experience really essentially has been defined by men and in the interest of men. I found all that to be true, but that's not the whole story. I was not finding African American women's presence in what women were saying. In other words I was studying white women's experiences as a source for doing feminist theology. So what that did for me then is that it told me that I needed to go and look someplace else. So that sent me to slave and ex-slave narratives to look at African American women's contributions in the area of defining African American women's reality and African American women's reality in our understanding of religion. In my research I was struck by a couple of slave, ex-slave narratives, and I really do not remember, I really need to look this up. I don't remember if these were two separate narratives or the same narrative. I think there were two separate narratives. But one narrative--in one narrative the slave--ex-slave was talking about the devotional life of the slave--of the mistress of the plantation. And she noted that the mistress would, every day at a certain time, she would sit in the parlor and read the Bible, do her Bible reading, devotional reading for the day. And then there's another slave narrative, I think the second slave narrative that I read where the slave or ex-slave was talking about having been beaten, having been ordered beaten by the foreman because the mistress had ordered the foreman to beat the slave, because the mistress had just discovered that the master of the plantation had sexually abused--had raped the slave woman. I call it rape; the text may not have used for the word rape, but it referenced sexual relation with the slave woman. Speaker 1: Who was she? Speaker 2: I call it rape because if you don't got freedom then you don't have the freedom to say no, you know, so it's rape. Well I couldn't reconcile those two narratives. One narrative talking about a woman sitting--a mistress sitting in the parlor reading the Bible as her regular devotional life, and the other narrative talking about the mistress on the plantation ordering the woman to be beaten because she got angry and upset and I guess in her disempowered state, she couldn't do anything to her husband, so she wanted the slave woman beaten. Story_ID: 187180 Speaker 1: And I kept asking myself, what was that woman reading in that Bible? What was that Bible telling her about what goes on outside that parlor that she was sitting--that parlor window that she was sitting in front of? What was that Bible telling her about how slave women, black are being treated on her plantation, even if this is a different (unclear), that's not the point. But the question what was the Bible telling her about slavery, about (unclear) slavery, how a people are systemically dehumanized, disenfranchised, disempowered, dehumanized day after day. What was that bible telling her? What that left me postulating then is that there's a radical difference between the experiences of the daughters of slaves and the experiences of the daughters of slaveholders.\",\n",
       " \"Well I was actually addressing from the same kinds of issues. When I began my gender explorations, I actually began by looking at what feminist were doing--some of the issues that feminists were raising in theology. So I was looking essentially at feminist theology. But as I was studying the work of feminist, you know, tensions of theologians, you know, I was increasingly struck by the lack of me, the lack of my presence, you know, the lack of African American female presence as I studied feminist analysis, the whole notion that women's experience has been ignored historically in the doing of theology and in the doing of any other disciplines as well and the notion that women's experience really essentially has been defined by men and in the interest of men. I found all that to be true, but that's not the whole story. I was not finding African American women's presence in what women were saying. In other words I was studying white women's experiences as a source for doing feminist theology. So what that did for me then is that it told me that I needed to go and look someplace else. So that sent me to slave and ex-slave narratives to look at African American women's contributions in the area of defining African American women's reality and African American women's reality in our understanding of religion. In my research I was struck by a couple of slave, ex-slave narratives, and I really do not remember, I really need to look this up. I don't remember if these were two separate narratives or the same narrative. I think there were two separate narratives. But one narrative--in one narrative the slave--ex-slave was talking about the devotional life of the slave--of the mistress of the plantation. And she noted that the mistress would, every day at a certain time, she would sit in the parlor and read the Bible, do her Bible reading, devotional reading for the day. And then there's another slave narrative, I think the second slave narrative that I read where the slave or ex-slave was talking about having been beaten, having been ordered beaten by the foreman because the mistress had ordered the foreman to beat the slave, because the mistress had just discovered that the master of the plantation had sexually abused--had raped the slave woman.

       " 'Speaker 1: But back to why grandmother [maternal grandmother, Amy Hawkins Williams] disliked whites so badly--see, Pappy [Gray\\'s maternal great-grandfather], as I told you, she said he was jet black, but he had this coal black straight hair. And as far back as I can remember, my grandmother was, she was a little lighter skin than you and she had reddish brown hair. Now mama [Millie Williams Armstead] says that, as a child growing up, that grandma had hair hanging way down her back, long hair hanging down her back. But I don\\'t remember her in that manner--I remember her as a child when I was about nine or ten. She had short hair, very much like an Afro, and folk weren\\'t even wearing them back there then. And mama said she guessed it was a nervous condition--said her mother used to just pick at her hair all the time. I\\'m sure it was nerves, but grandma said that when she was a girl, fourteen years of age, said Mammy [maternal great-grandmother] came and got her. And I can think, as being her child, what I said to my grandmother, you know, children, as, as Art Linkletter used to say, children can say some of the darndest things. And what I said to her--she, she said, \"Mammy came and told me that I had to go in and bathe. And she was going to take me up to the master\\'s house and say--I said, \\'Whatcha taking me up there for, Mammy?\\'--say, she said, \\'Well, we will see when we get up there\\'--said, \\'but the master asked me to bring you up there.\\'\" And when the master--I mean, when Mammy carried her up there to, to the master\\'s house, he told Mammy, \"You just leave her and go on, and you come back in about an hour, and you get her.\" And grandma said--she didn\\'t call it rape then. She said all the things that he did to me, and said I\\'ve got--I had an uncle named Edgar [ph.], and he was just a pretty man. She said all the things that he did to me--said that old no-nation son of mine, but she would call him that, but he wasn\\'t responsible for who he was--Uncle Edgar, my mother\\'s oldest brother. She said that she referred to him as an old, no-nation child--said that he\\'s the result of what the old master did to me. And she hated white people--she couldn\\'t stand them. And she was just fourteen years of age. And then Mammy brought up Uncle Edgar. And when he was a little boy about six years of age, the master told her, told Mammy to, \"Bring that boy up there to my house, and he\\'s going to be my houseboy\"--well, it was his child, see. And so, the master just about reared Uncle Edgar up there in his house--bringing in wood and splitting wood, and that sort of thing. I don\\'t know whether they let Uncle Edgar to go to school or not because he didn\\'t stay with grandma and grandpa, my mother\\'s mother and father, but that\\'s, that was a story that she told me.',\n",

Of course the children weren't allowed to go in the restaurants. Like now they can go wherever they want to, we couldn't because we knew the people who owned them and, and they knew our families. So it was off limits. But I think if I had to really describe, I would say that it was a safe neighborhood simply because everybody looked out for one another. The most horrible thing that I can remember during that time and, and, and which has caused me to have some feelings about rape and child abuse, is that when I was about eight or nine, I found a little girl crying on Fourth Street between some houses that had been sexually abused. And I picked her up. I did not know at the time what it was, I just thought she had fallen and hurt herself because she was crying. And I'm packing her around the corner to bring her to some of the women who, you know, lived there, cause they looked out--everybody looked out for everybody else's child. And it was many, many years later that I found out what had really happened to her because they quickly took her from me and, and, and took her to the doctor. We had a doctor that lived on Third Street, Dr. Wendell (oh.). And they took her, ran there and took her to him. And it was much, much later that I found out, you know what had happened.

People would move out, then the brick thieves would come in and start taking the thieves and the--and taking the bricks, and then you'd have a dangerous building. It was also, you know, these open buildings became safety hazard because people would be dragged into 'em and raped, and beat, and robbed and things of that sort.

Speaker 2: Well, well that during the Civil Rights Movement but even earlier than that there was a black man who was electrocuted after many years of appeals and they (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh right.

They said that when he was electrocuted the lights actually dimmed in the homes-- Speaker 2: Yes. Speaker 1: --and stuff. Speaker 2: Yes. I and because actually, and, it he, and I guess it was the first time that they had appealed for, it was a number of years from his actual arrest and trial to the execution. And probably the first time that a black man had ever been able to be processed even through the appeals system. But there was ample evidence that that it was not a rape but the fact was it was a black man involved with a white woman and it had to be nothing less than, than a rape. And so I remember when he was electrocuted for that. For me that, that was the first time I remember I understood the horror of segregation and Jim Crow. Speaker 1: And the interesting thing about that too is that, on some level and as crazy as it is, that's some kind of a victory that he actually got on trial, right? Speaker 2: It is. It is. And it (simultaneous)-- Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even an unfair trial. Speaker 2: Right. And even though people, blacks in Mississippi knew what the outcome would be and I guess I must have been five or six years old, I wasn't that old, but just old enough to understand that something wrong was happening here, something was going on. And I can remember the conversations between the adults, the fact that they would allow him even to appeal through the process was new because ordinarily, he would have just been hung on the site. And-- Speaker 1: Now-- Speaker 2: --and nothing would have been done about it.

I talked to him for about an hour, trying to get him to say anything. The only thing that he said, I said, \"If I could get you out of here, where would you want to go?\" And he finally said, \"Home.\" So I wrote on a yellow pad a temporary restraining order application, I served it on the warden, and then I appealed to him as a human being. I said, \"Look, you know, we can go and try to torture the judge into having a hearing, and, and do all this and get the lawyers involved.\" I said, \"But surely you don\\'t want a young man just to be viciously gang raped over and over again in your institution, under your own humanity. Won\\'t you please move him?\" And so they moved him, but listen to what happened. They moved him from the open ward, where he had been victimized, to the hospital floor, and they locked him in a cell so that nobody could get to him.

I learned about a week later when I came back to the prison, that at night the inmate orderlies had the keys to the cells, and that they had victimized this young man while he was up there in the hospital floor for his own protection. Now to me--we later got him sent to a mental hospital. And I hope that they were able to do something to restore him to sanity. But to me, that is a classic example of the kind of vicious inhumanity and disregard for people. And any system that would treat young people that way, or have a classification system like that, is an abomination. Story_ID: 611913 Speaker 1: So when we hear things about prisons and conditions in them, it may be to say, well, there are a lot of bad guys, there are a lot of bad guys, I\\'ve met a lot of them. But there\\'s so much more than that that is at issue and at stake, and it\\'s--not only the treatment of individuals, it\\'s the kind of society we insist up on having and we\\'ve got to fight back and push back because look at, look at what this is doing to black people, the increasing numbers of women, the disproportionate impact on our young men. It\\'s, it\\'s a vicious, vicious system. So that\\'s one example of the kind of suffering that I saw. Here\\'s another minor example, because I had just, I\\'ve, unfortunately a mind full of these stories, which is a terrible thing to carry around in your head to remember them. But I went and talked to, because there was an outbreak of tuberculosis and so we had filed to try to force the prison [Georgia State Prison, Reidsville, Georgia] to test everybody to see did these inmates have tuberculosis. There was one very handsome, tall, young brother whose name was Eugene X [ph.], he was a Muslim, and he was found with tuberculosis. And he had been coughing and hacking, he looked so pitiful and frail when I first met him, and they did get him some treatment. A couple of weeks later, I was talking to another inmate and I said, \"Well, you know, at least they got Mr. Barber [ph.] some care for his tuberculosis, and everybody has been tested, and so I feel better about that.\" And he looked me in the eye, he said, \"What?\" He said, \"I was his cellmate for a year, they never tested me.\" So you see the indifference with which human beings lives and wellbeing. I don\\'t think that we put these people in prison so they can develop tuberculosis or be gang raped. It\\'s, it\\'s, they may have done things that were wrong but there\\'s vicious cruelty.',\n",

Not to think otherwise. It's a very vicious system and the lack of quality representation and investigation means that a lot of people really are abused by the, the system. You know, after years of doing prison and jail litigation I've talked to a lot of people under sentence of death, people who are in--serving life sentences, people who are in and out, people who have been raped, people who have had mental breakdowns, people who are dying, people who have been stabbed, people who have been beaten, people who have been put in solitary confinement, it--it's a vicious, vicious system. And I don't know how we think that those who do get out are not marked for life in ways that often make them worse than when they went in. I know we've given up as a society on rehabilitation as a goal, but the lack of education, the lack of rehabilitative services, means that the recidivism rate, which is about two-thirds will continue unabated. And it's a tragedy all the way around for those who will be victimized by criminals in the future, and for people who might have, given a chance, been able to turn their lives around.\",\n",

I did have to walk three miles to school [Woodville Elementary School, Richmond, Virginia] and, and to church [Mount Tabor Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia] and I did it when I was six and seven and eight years old; which was unfortunate, because at eight years old I was molested once when I was coming from school, walking alone. But there was no transportation, you know, to, we had no school buses and the city buses didn\\'t run so the only way you got to school was to walk. Speaker 2: So, I would take it most of the time you\\'d try to walk with your brothers? Speaker 1: Yes, most of the time I\\'d walk with my brothers but for some reason that day I wasn\\'t with them and that was unusual and that\\'s--. And the guy that molested me was an older friend of one of my brothers of the family, and as they say, most of the time you\\'re molested by someone you know. And he threatened me if I said anything, he said that he would kill my brothers if I ever mentioned it to anyone. And so for many years I kept the secret and it was only after he was caught doing it to someone else and sent to reform school that I admitted that he had also molested me. Speaker 2: Okay, and that was still while you were in school and you were still school age? Speaker 1: That was when I was eight years old. Speaker 2: Eight, okay. Speaker 1: Yeah.

Maybe to themselves, they won't have an outward response but they're going to respond to it.

I remember her very well. Her family history is very interesting. She evidently had worked for as many, in many black families for, worked for a white household as a domestic worker, first in Louisiana, and then in Texas and she was raped repeatedly by the head of the household who was Irish. And so, my grandmother was half Irish and my mother of course has green eyes, and she's a very beautiful woman, she's eighty-nine years old, but that side of the family from my grandmother's side, you know has that history that so many African Americans don't really want to talk about which is a real dark side, I think in our history, but, that's my grandmother's side.\",\n",

And I, and I actually have done a number of lectures on sexual harassment issues because I have won a couple of big cases, very high-profile cases for my clients. But I, but the issue of sexual harassment is one that has really grown in the last 10 or 12 years, in part because people now are recognizing that the kinds of things that women--and by the way, I mean now, men are actually filing lawsuits for sexual harassment. But this is primarily been an issue of, of women and a lack of power that women have in the workplace. And so what I do is we, I do sexual harassment training so that we spend a lot of time at our clients\\' offices teaching people from, literally, from the C.E.O. to the person that empties the trash, about sexual harassment, about the responsibilities of the company, that the companies have, encouraging people to come forward to make a complaint. The way that the law has been developing in the Supreme Court is that a company really has to have a program, a procedure whereby a person who feels that they\\'ve been sexually harassed can make a complaint. If you have that procedure and you have trained your staff and people know that the procedure is there, then a person can\\'t show up at the courthouse door a year later, two years later and say, \"Well, I knew about the procedure, but I was afraid.\" And so what we\\'re really doing is educating the public, that if you feel like you\\'ve been sexually harassed, you need to complain to your employer. You need to make them do an investigation. They should do a prompt investigation, and if they find that there is sexual harassment, they need to stop it or else that company is gonna be on the hook for paying big damages to their employees.

The word got that y'all were gonna do this and you know the story of Forsyth County is that seventy-five years ago they had a white woman accuse a black man of raping her. They went through the town and packed up every--took people out of their houses, packed up every black person on the trucks and drove them to Alabama and dropped them off. I mean they left stoves burning, food cooking, they left all their belongings, they left everything. And there hadn't been a black person living in Forsyth County in seventy-five years. So that's the history of this place. But my father decided to go on. And so when we got further on down the road, we had to get off the bus and the bus had to shield us from the Klansmen that were throwing everything at us from manure to feces to urine, the bricks. They beat that--they broke every window in that luxury passenger bus with broom handles, with--I didn't hear any gunshots or anything like that and I saw little babies in Klan, that's the first time in a long time I'd seen like five years olds with the cap and the thing in the cross and everything. Just you know starch whites. So we had to get back on the bus and come back to Atlanta and in two weeks but it got on the news that people were beat. It got on the news that again here's Hosea Williams getting beat, blood being shed and the reaction causing a change in society. Here again he's playing that same role we talked about before and two weeks after that 35,000 people just swarmed on the city of Atlanta and we marched again. And we finished the march that day.

The men will look at young, attract--what they call attractive women, and they\\'re unfettered and free, and think that, \"Well, it won\\'t hurt for me to make a pass at her, or see how far this will go.\" Well, I had to deal with that like a young man would not have to do at that point. The female constituents of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] weren\\'t aggressive, and they weren\\'t reaching out to the young men in that sense, as it was. That was that duality of treatment. Still, the dual standard occurred there. And apparently, to them, I was a young attractive woman. So, I have been in some places, I awakened one night and to have a--I just happened--just woke up for some reason, and there standing over me was my host in the bedroom, in the guest bedroom.

But I was at Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] headquarters for a meeting, executive board meeting, and it was in 1960 and someone came in and told Dr. Jeanne Noble [Jeanne L. Noble], who\\'s also one of my mentors that something was happening and she just interrupted the meeting and she threw her hand up on her head and she said, \"Ah, oh my god, my god. We\\'ve gotta do something about that,\" she said, \"We--somebody call Dr. Willa Player [Willa Beatrice Player], the girls at Bennett [Bennett College, Greensboro, North Carolina] are having a demonstration in Greensboro [North Carolina] and they are about to close down the middle of the city, and we know that they\\'re gonna need FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agents and people.\" \\'Cause we thought then the FBI was supporting black people in the South. The Deltas had, they--we thought we had some agreements but any rate, we had a lot of agreements with women, white women and others in the South that when the black girls were being, the kids were being arrested, that they would go and do the bail for the black girls because they were being raped by the jailers at night. So there was all this heightened activity and Delta involvement so, I was saying, \"Well, what is this?\" I didn\\'t know nothing about Bennett at the time and they quickly explained that the Bennett girls were activists and the, that these sit-ins had not worked in February, so they were leading a civil rights march to the down--they were gonna sit down in the middle of Greensboro and stay there. And they were trying to get help there because it was a women\\'s college and there were about six hundred women and others involved, so, all of this flurry. So, that was really ho- and I, and, and in the chapters in the South with things going on and we were doing a lot of through Delta, in helping with the Civil Rights Movement.

She decided to take a job at one of the factories there, Ace Hardware. And they had not ever had a black woman working in that production line that they had there. So they hired her to be a maid, something she had done in their houses. So she was a maid. She joined the union though, and she didn't let that be widely known because that was a bit controversial if you joined the union. She joined the union, and she was convinced at a certain point that she should apply for one of those jobs on the floor in the production line because she could make more money on an hourly salary. She did, and because she had seniority built up as a maid, she was able to get ahead of some others who had applied for that job. She got the job, and there was resistance to her having the job because she was black, and she was a woman. And it got so bad that white men would spread feces all over the men's restroom, knowing that she had to clean it up. They did all kinds of things to harass her. So she complained, and her union rep and also the person that was the supervisor took my mother's side and told the men that if they continued doing that, they were gonna lose their job. Anyway, it was a big thing for mama to go from being a maid to being a person working in production in this Ace Hardware factory. So that was the kind of thing they were doing. It was very quiet kinds of things, the things that don't make headlines. But in their own quiet ways, they were challenging the conditions under which they were living and working.\",\n",

And there was a big search, and ultimately, her body was found thrown off the roof and sandwiched between two buildings, kind of thing. In any case, it was a big mystery. And a lot of people who attend the opera are people who either own or edit The New York Times (laughter) or have friends who were there. So it was a big story from the jump because it affected that part of society in New York [New York City, New York]. And it was my story. So I did a lot of interesting stories related to that trial, and my greatest achievement, I think, was when the--we knew when the trial was opening, we knew at that point that the defendant had supposedly confessed. The defendant was a stage hand. And apparently, he had accosted the violinist, and tried to engage her in a romantic liaison. Of course, she was having none of that. And he ended up raping and killing her. Well, we knew that the prosecution said that it had confession, a confession from him, but we didn\\'t know the content of the confession. So jump ahead, we\\'re there at the beginning of the trial, opening statements by the prosecution and the defense. And the prosecutor gets up and tells us what he\\'s going to prove. And he gives a narration of what happened from the time Helen Hagnes Muntiks, I think was the name, from the time she left the orchestra pit to the time her body was found. And as I\\'m listening to that, I\\'m thinking, he\\'s telling us the confession. Who else knew this stuff except whoever confessed?

And this I don\\'t like to talk about because I been to Chicago [Illinois] in \\'47 [1947], my mother had brought me on vacation to visit this aunt I\\'m tellin\\' you about and--I might as well put this on here--it\\'s something I really don\\'t like to talk about and I really--and I guess one of the reasons I haven\\'t written a book is a fella I used to go with--brother, we just went for a ride with two other friends, molested me. And I got pregnant and that was like--for my mother--that was like, oh my God--and I really--this is the first time I\\'ve ever talked about it to anybody--I mean outside--on screen or talked about it historically. I--when my mother found out then that was the first time I\\'d had a relationship--he took advantage of me and I got pregnant so instead of her--and thank God she didn\\'t now--have an abortion, that was just out because several of my friends and my best friend, who is Dr. Alma George, was the first black woman president of the medical association in Detroit [Michigan], somebody else you should interview. Her father, Dr. P.N. George was my, my doctor and she could have had an abortion but that was--my mother wouldn\\'t hear of that. So my mother sent me North to Chicago [Illinois] and all my friends went off to school and for about--oh boy--ten years of my life or longer--oh much longer than that, my mother never ever allowed that, until maybe--and I don\\'t know if she ever got over it. She always threw that up to me and I remember Mrs. George and several people sayin\\', \"We can give her an abortion or some--you know--she can go away.\" Oh, that was unheard of and thank God because Babitu wouldn\\'t be here--now when I think about it.

And, had three children after that by him and in between these children, was going to [Wilson Junior] college [Chicago, Illinois] and he would tear my books so I want to recite he would think, pay me some attention and this sort of thing and he physically abused me.

I was so affected by that, that trip to South Africa, not Johannesburg [South Africa], Durban [South Africa], Cape Town [South Africa], they just like being at home. Cape Town remind me of Charleston [South Carolina], but when you went out into the village, the villages where the schools were and when we visited the island [Robben Island, South Africa] where Mandela [Nelson Mandela] was imprisoned, you come back not with the feeling of legacy as far as your inheritance, but because of the struggle. That's how we connected to South Africa because of the struggle. But, to go in the village where there's no electricity, no running water it was unbelievable that people live that way today, and then South Africa is a developed country. It's not an underdeveloped country, but everything is centered on the city. And the whites there, you got the true meaning of no middle class. You're either upper class or you were lower class. And then AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] being rampant, the way women were treated. They didn't even frown against rape. They were just sort of making that a real criminal activity, rape, and the struggles of the children who were left without parents. So, I came back, went back to Links, I went to Links again for, I mean for Avery [Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina], went back to Links and told them what my heart felt and that I would like for them to call together, make a call for organizations that would be interested in doing something in Africa.\",\n",

I think we were doing some television work or whatever, but anyway, we were going to stay in the corporate apartment. I\\'m thinking I was the only woman and these three men, and I\\'m trying to figure out, okay, how is this going to work? So, the president made sure he gave me the master suite, basically, with the separate toilet, bathrooms and all that, but it also had a huge fireplace in the living room, so I was talking to the senior VP over at corporate affairs, human relations, human resources at the time, and he started rubbing my arm, the fireplace is going, we\\'re drinking schnapps or whatever, Courvoisier brandy or whatever. This was after dinner and after, you know, and he said, \"I want to talk to you.\" And it was very obvious what he was doing, and see by this time I could spell ha- sexual harassment and I knew what it looked like. I knew what it looked like, I knew what it felt like. Before I didn\\'t know what it looked like and what it felt like. I knew I didn\\'t want any part of it, and he said, \"Is this bothering you?\" I said, \"No, if it\\'s not bothering you; but I wish you\\'d stop.\" And so I got up and I went to my room and I closed the door and I thought, okay, there you go. You\\'re down the tubes. So, the next morning he would not even, he never spoke to me again after that, and he was the senior VP of human resources, and I don\\'t know whether he thought I was going to file a claim, I don\\'t know whether he thought I was going to file a claim. I don\\'t know whether he thought how dare I rebuff him? I mean, we had been very cordial before that, but he iced me out and actually I was glad.',\n",

He went to Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina]. Well, I went to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], okay?

So I was available to them for whatever their problems were; whether they were not making the right grades, whether they were being harassed by a teacher, or they thought they were being harassed by a teacher. But I also did it for white students as well. They came with similar problems. The major, one of the major functions of that position was to decide who would be considered in state and out of state. Because there is an immense difference in the, in the tuition of in state students and out of state students. And I developed a criteria for determining who was in state and who was out of state, and applied that--saw that that criteria was applied to every student about whom there was a question. So those were my two, were my three (gesture) major functions as, as associate vice president.',\n",

You didn\\'t see that many fair-skinned people that didn\\'t have fair--other fair-skinned people in their families. And so while I think rape was common during my mother\\'s day, I think many people aborted or did not have a child. But my mother did, and he was such a wonderful person. He was, he was so good that when he was living in the country, as he did with my grandmother [Annie Young O\\'Neal] until he was in the eighth grade--and that\\'s as far as the country schools went. Then, by then my father [Junius Reed] had left, my father. My biological father had left. And so I said to Mama, \"Why can\\'t we have Jay [James O\\'Neal] to come\" because I loved him dearly.

No one to help her, no one to guide her, no one to help her through all that pain and I wanted to let people know, you know that she had been dealt that hand. So, I think I have done a lot of that.

Speaker 2: She was never, ever, ever the same. The thing that we thought was that she would get over this, but this was a time when before people would talk about these things. So, everyone kept it really quiet. She never got the help that she was supposed to get to kind of help her get beyond it. So, Diane [Diana Ross] and I, and I\\'m speaking for Diane now only because I\\'m thinking she thinking the same way I did, was that we thought once we became famous and rich you know, Florence would be over it you know, but she never did. So, when little things started coming here, she doesn\\'t--she\\'s a very family--she was a really the kind of person who wanted to be with her family. So, now we\\'re never home, we\\'re always traveling and she wanted to be you know with her family and she felt, you know, this has kind of hurt her and then when she no longer could sing anything other than our, \"Oohs,\" or, \"ahs,\" that tore at her. So, every little thing started tearing at her and anytime something was not going the way we wanted it, her wanting it or whatever, then it would just, she would get deep depressed, depressed and pretty soon it just really, it really destroyed her.

I said, \"Make sure you leave it to me you know.\" And I remember sitting there thinking about that stole and, and how I had asked her to leave me that stole.

You know she would tell you, she could tell you, and you know people always could have the last, last say? Flo was that kind of way, she always could come up with the right thing would be the--whatever. She always was the kind of person, also was the kind of person who had this very hearty laugh. If Flo was happy, she could laugh and everybody would be laughing, she just had this Santa Claus, ho, ho, ho--kind of laugh, and she was just real. Florence was a real--I would say she was like a real black--have you ever seen a real black good woman? Flo was that woman (laughter), you know. She was that way, but she also had a great voice. I also--I always thought she sounded very much--she had the kind of style of Etta James style. So, she really had a good R and B sound and, and her voice was pure, she had a pure, pure voice, and I think the only thing that really made her--I won't say made her happy, but the only thing that she really--she loved to sing, that's what she loved to do. That was all--I think that was her biggest thing, and then once she was no longer singing, her children were her, the, the love of her life, her children, she loved her children, but singing was what made Flo, so when that was no longer there, she lost a lot of herself.\",\n",

And they\\'re like, \"We\\'ll get kicked off the team.\" So it was just like, it was (laughter) it was, it was not pretty. But I did date a guy and so of course he wasn\\'t on, he was, he had been an athlete, but he is now an engineer and he was older and my dad was just like (sigh) you know, so yeah. I will tell you this. I dated interracially and I still do because that\\'s the environment you grow up in. And my dad was very negative about me dating white men and that changed. But it\\'s funny they raised me to be open minded.

And, so, you know, and [maternal] great-granddaddy [Robert Scott] was half white and his daddy [Richard Hill (ph.)] was white. So, you know, what are saying? So it was like this challenge between my dad and I because he knew the story of his mother [Willie Mae McNeil Scott] being raped. He knew the story of, you know, other women as he would say, who had been raped and he was very afraid for me that something bad could happen and nobody would do anything about it.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's similar to Rosewood [Texas], yep, yep. So you've heard of this, yep and, so that's where all the blacks live now. The interesting thing is if you think about my mother's [JoAnn Scott Wilson] side of the family, it's more of a professional class, educated or at least aspirational to be educated. My father's side of the family was very working class. His father actually helped put the railroads down. Not working on the railroad train but, putting the railroad ties down across the State of Texas. So a working man, and, but Littig was--I actually--my dad--when I was a little girl drove, he drove us to this little town. He did a little turn off and what was left of their property was just a little water spout. And dad said this town used to be a bustling town, railroad depot, and then they rerouted the train away and the whole town died afterwards. Speaker 1: So it is now what they call a ghost town I guess. Speaker 2: It's somewhat--I mean--I think there, there are some development there with, you know, maybe fishing and spa and golf. But it's not owned by black folks like it once was. His, his stories are more harrowing and very sad, and very--dad doesn't ever really want to revisit that and his older brothers and sisters don't either. His family, so-- Speaker 1: Now he really isn't that old. He, he's like well, (unclear) (simultaneous)-- Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My dad is seventy. He'll be seventy this year. Speaker 1: All right. So he was born more like-- Speaker 2: So he was born on June 1st, 1940. Speaker 1: Right. Speaker 2: And he's the youngest, so his eldest brother was a guy named Doris [Doris Wilson]. Doris was actually very smart. He was the product of a rape, though. His--my grandmother [Pauline Ross Wilson] was very fair skinned again similar to my mother's mother [Willie Mae McNeil Scott], and how would I describe it, she was very elegant, classy even, you know, held herself with a regalness that, you know, but she was a housekeeper. But she still was, you know, did quilting and canning of perserves and almost I use--she was the ecofriendly guru to my life, right now if you think about it, she reused everything from aluminum foil to, you know, having a backyard garden. And I think that what I remember most about her is she was a very giving person, a very loving person. The--I'm bouncing around but I will simply say her first son was a product of a rape. She was raped by a black man, so her son turned our very dark skinned, and then all of the subsequent children after she married my grandfather are very brown skinned. So Uncle Doris--if you think about the timeframe when my dad was a little boy, Uncle Doris was in World War I [WWI]. So my father was a little boy and his older brother was in World War I.

But, my grand- her father was dark. It\\'s a funny thing in our race, and we\\'re getting back to it now, they still doing it in school. I have a lot of little mentees so this is another story for another time though. I had to go and see about a little girl who they were calling black because her skin color was, was dark. And, so, my grandmother was a beautiful woman but people--we had been, I guess, persecuted so long, we saw black as not being beautiful. We, we couldn\\'t conceptualize and therefore my grandmother went and ironed and my mother, her mother did not recognize she was--my grandmother was 5\\'2\", weighed probably ninety pounds or 100 pounds. And, she kept seeing that my grandmother\\'s stomach was getting a little full. You know, my grandmother was probably about six or seven months pregnant. And, she said, \"What is wrong with you?\" She said, \"I told you Mr. Allen--,\" and explained to him, her what had happened. And, so, she, my grandmother--all the boys I think were away. Like I told you my grandmother was next to the baby boy. All my grandmother\\'s brothers were in the [U.S.] Army. They were gone away. She went to this doctor\\'s house and told him she was gonna kill him. She had a hatchet. But, they ran her away and she went back home.

Speaker 1: --came and got my grandmother and took her out to a tree and tied her to a tree. And, during those days, my mama said my grandmother wore white cotton stockings, you know, they would do that \\'cause she work so hard and had had all those children. I guess she had varicose veins or something. And, she said that they beat her until the skin on her legs rolled down in the stockings. And, said, that--I get emotional when I think about it (crying). But, she told them, she was such a strong woman, she told them, say, \"You might kill me but you can\\'t eat me. You--Dr. Allen\\'s son raped my daughter and I entrusted him to go there.\" She was trying to help the family by ironing clothes and the, the boy who was my mother\\'s father drove up and said, \"Let her go.\" And, she had them put her in his car and he took her back to where she lived and, and treated her. But, when they took the stockings off the skin came off. But, she was bloody everywhere but they said that, and he told this story, said that, to my grandmother, said, \"Your mama is some woman.\" Even in the midst of about ten men beating her, they didn\\'t wanna just kill her. That was too easy. They wanted her to suffer. And, when they told her, she just said, the last thing she said before she passed out, \"You can kill me, but you cannot eat me.\" And, looked them right in the eyes, with the hoods over their faces.

If I were still alive, I\\'d be living in a trailer park in Greenville, South Carolina, with a bunch of kids, some of whom would be dead. Because that\\'s what I was raised to be.

The first woman to speak actually was the director of the Women's Center at the time, and she was drunk, which was a little bit startling to me. And I think it was the second or third woman that spoke that just killed me, because it was one of the secretary-looking women ... very well dressed, lots of makeup ... took hold of that shell like it was a life raft, and started talking almost immediately about, she needed help because, you know, she looked good, she was in control, everything was working. But she woke up in the middle of the night every night ... every fucking night ... wanting to get up and go drive to Georgia and kill her father. And then she said why. And no person in my life or anywhere in my imagination had ever said it out loud. I didn't think you could say it loud and still live. And that she was so different from me confounded it. It just changed everything. There's this thing that happens. I had gotten used to, as a kid, to moving a lot. I was used to the phenomenon of, land in a new place, present yourself. You always have a story. And I played, when I was young, with being different people when we ... because we moved every six months or less. So I was used to the present-yourself. I always had a draft of myself, and I designed the story I told about myself for what I wanted ... mostly to be taken seriously. But the moment she started talking, the self that I had been preparing to present, which was about looking good to that woman in that beanbag chair, disappeared. Everything disappeared, and it was like, I am not ready to talk about this, but I'm going to keep coming back and figure out how to talk about this, and how to make a difference. ANDERSON: How long did it take before you were able to talk about it in that group? ALLISON: Whew! Well, probably about the same time I started sleeping with the girl in the beanbag chair. A couple weeks, not long, not long. Although the way I talked about it was very careful, very careful. ANDERSON: What were you censoring? ALLISON: How complicated incest really is. I was actually censoring who I was, trying to present as middle class, because I had a college education and I didn't want to be my mother or my sisters, and doing fairly ... what I thought was a fairly good job of presenting as middle class. I had a job with the Social Security Administration. I did not wear high heels, but still, I could look like a secretary, and I was trying. It would be three years before I would ever really get to the place where I was talking nakedly. And it would be a decade before I could really ... before that stuff all cracked and I could really look at it and talk about it frankly. There was just no language. And all the stuff that was deeply complicated about ... was impossible to talk about quickly. Sometimes you have to wait for the culture to catch up with you. The thing that nearly destroyed me, both as a kid and as a young adult, was that being raped could provoke a sexual response, and that you could eroticize violence, which is exactly how I survived. I understand a lot of it now ... I'm 58 years old ... but I did not understand it back then, and I could not have articulated it. But it does inculcate an enormous amount of self-hatred, and that's dangerous to talk about. And even when you can talk about it, I talked about it in very structured, abbreviated ways. And let's be frank, the early women's movement was a movement of slogans and simplicity, and I was not simple and I hated slogans. ANDERSON: Yeah. ALLISON: Yeah. ANDERSON: Yeah. But you still broke the silence for the first time around (inaudible) that CR group. ALLISON: And that's, I think, what triggers a lot of energy and empowerment, and then the long, slow process of actually sorting through all that stuff and starting to make changes in your life. That takes a lot ... ANDERSON: Yeah. ALLISON: A lot. The women's movement was ready for a lot of what I was ready for, but there were some things I was ready for that the women's movement was not yet ready for. (laughs)\",\n",
       " \"And there was just such a horror, especially since, at the same time, I was working in the anti-rape movement and in the shelter movement, but in the shelter movement was where I would find women who could talk about it, and who could talk about falling in love with somebody who would slap you. And that sometimes a slap feels like a caress, and to actually begin to have those conversations. That's where I began to have those conversations. I couldn't have them in my academic, literary feminist world. Nobody would talk about it, and they didn't have ... or if they had the feelings, they were not going to admit they had the feelings, or that they had the experience.\",\n",

I\\'m like, All right, what is really going on here? Why? And especially after I started interviewing people about fetish and all of that eroticization. I was like, Okay, what if I organized my sex life the way I organized my political life? Could we really make this a little safer and saner? And that was the whole premise of the Lesbian Sex Mafia, which is, what if we really just tried to make it a little safer and saner? Some of it was just about getting information. \"How Not to Get Killed\"\\x9d was one of our early workshops.',\n",

But they do not have the immediate access to resources and support that we put in place in our bookstores, in our women's centers, in our rape crisis centers. Fuck, they don't even have the support that the gay men put into place in the bars. They have the illusion of it.\",\n",

How would you monitor that? ALLISON: Oh goodness. One is that ... My ideology, my conviction, is to honor all perversion, which means, you know, the girls that want to come and just watch get just as much respect as the ones who want to put on a show. A lot of people who go to parties ... it\\'s about exhibitionism and honoring that, but trying to make it so that no one was being harassed or forced to do stuff they didn\\'t want to do. That gets very complicated. And to a certain extent, you\\'ve got to know the people and know what\\'s going on. It can pretty easily step over into being ... what is it? ... matronizing.

It\\'s really profoundly complicated to have a feminist sex party. (laughs) Some of it is simple. You make sure there\\'s food, you watch the consumption of liquor. You make sure there are no drugs, because then you get busted. You make sure there are no people underage, because then you get busted. You make sure nobody\\'s got a camera, because then people can get blackmailed. And you watched ... you have certain rules for how parties proceed, which means you can ...

And they were talking about class in a more serious, connected-to-your-real-life-everyday-life ... which was at a distance from talking about ... You can talk about theory, and the women's movement talk theory about class really well, and we did that in Tallahassee. We could talk theory. But up in Vermont, all of a sudden that dorm, with people talking about language and what made you uncomfortable. And all of a sudden it was like another light came on in the room, and I could see another corner that I hadn't really been paying much attention to, but which I had been dealing with for years. But all of a sudden it's like all of these points where I panic, where I back up, where I start pretending and hiding, almost all of these are class-based or incest-based sex stuff. That deep sense of shame that I was born with, I did not actually have to continue to carry. I could actually use it to batter the people about me, and I did.

The same thing happened with a lot of the rape crisis stuff. So a lot of things that we developed, we ... feminist activists ... created, got taken over by much more conservative, socially acceptable, heterosexual organizations. It was just so relentless. Pretty depressing. ANDERSON: Yeah, and then it became the service industry and the social change movement. ALLISON: Exactly. And there was this constant struggle about whether it was radical or whether it was reform. ANDERSON: Right. ALLISON: Some of that is coded ... I always thought ... was a coded argument, because the real argument is ... (chuckles) ... the real argument was, who was career making and who was trying to change the world? And, you know, both can happen at the same time. A lot of these organizations became conservative because people were career making and they couldn't risk their careers, so they had to keep their respectability quotient. So they couldn't do real radical stuff. It's like, right back to the waitress union. You know, they'll let you do a whole lot of things that look radical, but when you actually begin to deal with genuine economic issues, they'll shut you right down. Or you'll suddenly be in danger in ways you haven't been before, which is some of what happened in the rape crisis and shelter movement in D.C.

I think in part I got the Women's Center invested in it because I had pushed for it. And it blew up completely because, in fact, the university threatened to shut the Women's Center down. Now there was a lot of stuff that we had done that they had let slide, but that union-organizing effort ... they were going to shut the Women's Center down. We had to pull it out of the Women's Center or lose the Women's Center. And that was one of the times when I thought, Okay, class is the biggie here, because that's exact ... You know, all this other stuff ... rape crisis, childcare ... now, these are cross-class issues. But when you talk about a waitress union, you're talking about a working-class issue, and you're talking about working with black women, and that was where both the university administration and a lot of people in the Women's Center panicked.\",\n",

And by the time I got old enough and strong enough to counter that and more or less stop it, I found a place of safety, which was to be asexual. But that doesn't stop desire or fantasy or lust, so that a lot of my erotic fantasies centered on being trapped with girls in terrible situations in which I alone could rescue them by performing acts of enormous suffering. So then a lot of that became a lot of my erotic charge for most of my teenage years. I would fall in love with girlfriends, and I tended to fall in love with the more butch girls, although I did not have a language. I didn't have the word lesbian, except that I read constantly, and gradually ... And then I discovered my stepfather's porn, and that's where I found lesbians.

So next, Lillie moved it up to the big area, outside area, in the big hallway, in the walk path. So it was huge. And it was really there that I think we really started to understand that we are the ones we were waiting for, like June Jordan said, and that the answers are in our stories, and it's in the process of telling our stories that can set us free and put us on the right path. So it was such a gift, and it was such a wonderful way to learn about our health issues, to learn about how much violence that we were living with ... be it domestic violence, be it sexual violence ... to know that so many women have been raped, that so many women have been victims of sexual abuse, and have had no way to talk about it, to heal, and how when women do it in isolation or when it's done to us in isolation, we think that we're the only people having it happen, that nobody else in the world is having it happen. But what we learn in the presence of other black women, that this is happening, we understand that we have an institution of sexism that's going on in our lives that tends to oppress us, and that the only way we can get out from under it is to learn how to unhook. And that was the gift that Lillie brought to the black women's health movement, is how do we unhook, and the value of storytelling.\",\n",

We connected, and she was very influential in helping me think about reproductive health ... helping me work through things about rape, about abortion, about a lot of the hard issues and things that I really had never talked to anyone about.

And so, we went, first to Johannesburg. We started in Jo'burg, and we taught the women the Self-Help. But we asked the women ... it was very interesting ... we asked them to get us a cross section of women. We didn't just want the ones who were the professionals, we also wanted the regular women, you know. Of course, the Johannesburg people only brought in the professionals, because they didn't think the other women were ready. So, we trained them in Self-Help. But what was so wonderful, one of the women, Mankubo Manelepe(?), lived in Lenenye(?), in the Northern Transvaal of South Africa, and she was a smart woman. She brought a band of 16 women from Lenenye to the Johannesburg meeting. And so, they were there. They were rural women. They were there among the training that we did. We taught them Self-Help, we talked about our issues, we focused in three areas. These were the areas that were identified by the women in South Africa, and each of us ... there were five of us ... and each of us were paired with a South African woman.

       " \"I think that, though, one thing that I must say that stands out crystal clear to me was probably the most important thing I did was ask the question, What's the difference between black women's health issues and white women's health issues? Mostly because that placed an emphasis on looking at us based on our ethnicity, our culture, our subculture, the way we were reared, the things that go on in our life and how that affects our health, and the fact that we as black women have a different perspective. I was really perplexed by, when white women got together, really the most of the things they only wanted to talk about were reproductive health issues. But when black women got together, and we started talking about health, we started talking about different things. We started talking about things that had to do with psychological well-being. We started talking about issues that were affecting our lives ... violence, sexual abuse ... and also, white women were talking about these things, but they were not priorities. And reproductive health ... black women would use reproductive health services but they were not priorities. And so, the whole thing that makes our health issues unique to us depends on looking at what are our specific priorities that have been influenced by who we are and our ethnicities. I\",\n",

We took a delegation of 25 women and one man to Africa to the Women's Conference, and that was ... just getting people there and back was an experience in itself. But then the conference on top of that was just incredible ... and to have it in Kenya and to have those African women with their congas made special for the conference and to have all the hundreds of workshops and the daily newspapers. And a film was made of us called It's Up to Us that was made by a woman from Connecticut, Bea Milwe. She followed us around and we found this women's group out in the rural part of Nairobi and they raised cows and we went and spent a whole day with them ... dancing, learning about their lives, us telling them about our lives, and learning how different our lives were. And then, not a whole lot that was very similar, that they really lived very different lives from what we had. It made a lot of us a lot more appreciative of our lives. And then, in a lot of ways, they had things that were a lot better than what we had ... that we introduced the word incest to them, that they had no word for it. But we were trying to explain incest to them. And explain rape, which they had kind of vaguely heard of rape happening in Nairobi, but certainly not where they were. And then for incest, they had to do a translation. There was no one word for it. And I sort of was sorry we introduced the term. But then, on the other hand, there was such a reality in our lives to leave there without having them understand that, I think, would've been not being our true, authentic selves. We also collected money and we bought two cows for them and left them with two cows, which was really, really good. I think about those women sometimes and wonder how much has changed, you know, in these years between their lives and our lives.\",\n",
       " \"LYTHCOTT: Well, we moved there in 1961 and left in 1969. And I can say to you that it helped me to realize that African people could be anything that we wanted to be. It led me to feel very close solidarity with African people, wherever we are, and it resulted in me getting involved in the pan-Africanist movement, something that was very vital to me. Thinking about ... and almost having this ... I'm a very concrete thinker, and so, I almost had this vision in my head of pieces of a puzzle coming back together, as African people from all around the world would pull back together again, with the different strengths and weaknesses that we have based upon the different places of the diaspora where we were sprinkled ... or raped and robbed or whatever. And pan-Africanism became very important to me.\",\n",
       " \"AVERY: I think it's very important for younger women to gather as many of the cross-cultural reproductive health experiences of women that they can, because they need to show that this is not just something ... like, being in charge of your fertility, your reproduction, it's not just something for American women, European women, that across all the cultures from the beginning of time, this has been something that has been passed from women to women, and that we need to know how do Asians handle it, how do Southeast Asians handle it, how Indians handle it, how everybody handles it, so we have in our psyches a legend of how women have handled reproduction throughout the ages. And sometimes that will be what will give us our courage and give us our strength, because as we look back, we find out that these women ran into difficulties, that they ran into backlashes, that they ran into antis, but that they also ran into people who were grateful for the help that they were able to give them. That it is important to learn about the life of the grand midwives in the South, and how they took care of women who had babies, how they helped women who had had far too many babies and didn't want to have other babies, how they handled women who had been victims of rape, how they handled women who were victims of incest. How they worked with everything in a nonjudgmental way, that, I think it is really, um ... there's a lesson in there for all of us. So, I think, do your homework. Talk to other women. This is not necessarily something you get from books. Go up to women. Start the conversation. Have them talk to their relatives wherever they are, so that we can stop having us think that this is something unique at this time that's going on. It's been going on throughout the ages, and will continue.\",\n",

Or women who are survivors of cancer are the women who have started the major cancer movements in this country, and so forth. And that we now have a movement of women living with AIDS who are in leadership in the movement ... are some of the most inspiring voices that keep me in this work.',\n",
       " \"DIXON DIALLO: The incidence of violence coinciding with the incidence of HIV, and the prevalence of them both over time, from an anecdotal standpoint, are real clear. But we still don't have ... at least from a U.S. standpoint. Internationally we have a lot more data to actually quantify, you know, the impacts of HIV and violence on each other, the bicausal effect, the bidirectional effects. We have less data inside the United States. But what we do know is that for women who are in violent situations or even abusive relationships ... so there may not even be physical or sexual violence happening yet, but even if there's emotional and mental abuse going on, is that the diminishing of their own sense of power and capacity to effect change in their own relationships will also diminish their opportunity to negotiate safer sex, to get tested, to know their status, or to disclose their status once they're aware. If they are HIV-positive around disclosing their status, that means that they are less likely to engage in accessing health care. They're less likely to ask for help or be seen asking for help. And so the presence of violence actually disempowers a woman to do anything about HIV that she thinks might be her right or the right thing to do to protect herself. And from the other standpoint, because of the stigma and the discrimination associated with HIV and AIDS, for a woman who is positive, she has an increased risk of violence in a lot of ways, and the notion of ... if we talk about structural violence, that the criminalization of HIV has actually been increasing. So knowingly having HIV, or not knowing her status and putting other people at risk ... that's a constant burden that a woman or people with HIV walk with. And that increases violence if someone finds out and has not been informed about that HIV status. The fact that in relationships where most times ... most times ... women are monogamous. And partners, male partners, are more than likely not, especially those who are violent, may ... are more than likely are not monogamous, right? So you have women in monogamous situations who think they're in monogamous relationships and are not, with men who are in denial about the risks that they're bringing home to their family. So a woman who ends up HIV ... and this has happened over and over ... who confronts a partner about their HIV status ends up being battered, brutalized, or even killed because their partner is in such denial that they blame the wife or their female partner for that.\",\n",
       " \"So you've got the violence against women, you've got the HIV situation, and then you combine that with this third leg around an untouched area of mental health needs that we have. I would include substance abuse in that, but the mental health status, meaning how healthy we already are in our belief system. How we feel. How stable are we? How much trauma are we already surviving as women based on some of the other social injustices that happen to us? Rape, incest, child molestation, just neglect, being treated differently because of skin color in the family. I mean, all of these are critical issues for women of color that play into not only the decisions we make in terms of HIV but what might happen or us or what might not be available to us because of all of those other conditions.

And who is speaking out and who is crying about this? We also used it to say sexist violence should be considered a hate crime. We were among the first to say that. And what made it so powerful was we would say, What is it about this that's not the same as acts against people of color or acts against religious minorities? So we did a lot of national work, taking that local evidence. Then we did a lot of just consciousness-raising, and we still do that. It's kind of gotten [to be] a popular thing now, but we would put tombstones out on our front lawn with a bio of the woman ... this was around 1990 ... and call press, and the families would come and lay flowers next to them and you would see the picture of this woman and read this heartbreaking story of why and how she was killed, and often, what didn't happen to the perpetrator.\",\n",

       " 'PHARR: Well, here I was, one of the people who formed that group, and I kind of mark that moment where I regain my integrity [because], after a couple of meetings, it was very clear that if we were going to talk about our lives, we have to talk about our lives. That for me was the first time ever I had said in a public space, \"I am a lesbian.\"\\x9d And I did it with trepidation in my heart. Because, as far as I knew, all of these women were heterosexuals, and I knew that I couldn\\'t be authentic and it\\'d be a meaningless group. Everybody else would be having this experience of telling the truth about their lives, because that\\'s what consciousness-raising groups were all about. They were for many people, for the first time ever, saying, This is what happened. This is how it felt. This is my experience. And to understand that the authenticity of one\\'s experience is what gives us genuine politics. If you could get those genuine experiences from a large number of people and if they cut across race and class and age, then we would have a politic that we could live with. It was also in that time when we all began doing hotlines, not just for women to call in to talk about general things, but particularly for violence. And then there was anti-rape work that came out of that.',\n",
       " \"We would take on really, really hard issues. An example would be at the University of Arkansas, it had a great winning basketball season. They were heading to a tournament. And the basketball players, who happened, that year, to be African American, took home to the dorm a young ... I don't know how young, maybe college-age ... white woman, who was very drunk and dancing on the tables and that sort of thing, and all raped her. And it was a huge, huge thing in the press because it was going to take them out of the tournament. That was what the primary press was about it. We jumped in the middle of that. And it was fierce. It was really fierce. We thought that this was what our job was, that we had to jump in the middle of that and talk about both race and gender. ANDERSON: So did you have differences of opinion with other feminist organizations and leadership? PHARR: The feminists were furious with us, and the African American community was furious with us, and the sports community was furious with us. Eventually I think people came to understand what we were talking about. But we did a gender analysis about rape, and we did a racial analysis about sports and African Americans and the use of African Americans and tossing them away, out of the school. We put those two things together. We gained someone here. We would lose someone there, but gosh, we were attacked in the newspaper. We received hate mail, all kinds of things. But we thought that this was our work. The work was not to lay back and say, Well yeah, you know, she was drinking. She deserved to be raped. Well yeah, you know, these African American men, it doesn't matter that they were poor young men in southeast Arkansas who were recruited to play basketball and are not given an education while they're there, and the second they have an injury are tossed out and back in poverty. We're not going to talk about race and class, we're going to talk about all of that. So that was our work.\",\n",

So there was all this literature floating around out there defaming him in one way or another, right? I remember my father calling me into the living room. He was sitting in his rocking chair, and he had some of this literature. It's the only time my father ever talked about sex to me. And what he did is he told me that Dr. King had been molesting young girls, and this proved it, right? And I don't know what else he said, you know, whatever, this is why these people are terrible. This is, you know, whatever his line was. I just remember that part of it very distinctly, and I remember feeling that something was terribly, terribly, terribly wrong that my father would be talking to me like this about sexual matters ... that something was really, really wrong, that he would be doing that, that it was across all appropriate boundaries, that it was just ... wow, this is bad, bad, bad.

Like I remember my lover Cris after she was raped and how I went and took her bloody clothes and washed them and mended them. I've even written a poem about it. And I knew that the reason Cris was raped was because she was a butch lesbian. I knew all this stuff, but I hadn't put it in a larger context of the history of lesbians and butches and the bars and the women's movement. I just hadn't put it ...

We called it a week, but it was really a weekend because ... and then it actually grew to being able to be a whole week of activities and so forth and so on that included the march. It included so many different aspects of sexual assault, and it's how we were able to pull in so many women of color to work on it. And that, you know, it grew, and that the Rape Crisis Center, they changed to Rape Awareness Week, and then Rape Awareness Week became Rape Awareness Month because of NCASA, the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault.\",\n",

There was no movement and there was no focus on housing or anything like that. But when I was at the Center, I met this woman named Emma D'Angelo, Puerto Rican sister named Emma D'Angelo, who was working at the Center, and she was doing housing work. She was real interested in doing housing work. And I had some, you know, but we had been working on that survey in neighborhoods, like the safety of neighborhoods, the attitudes about it, so I had come to be able to see more safety issues around housing and stuff like that. But Ami had asked me to go to a ... I think she asked me to go to a tenant meeting with her, yeah. Because also, two other women, Maureen and BJ, were working on housing at the Center, on the neighborhood stuff around housing, and so from that, they had somehow, they had also gotten into using that as a way for the people to help organize tenants, just safety issues so they don't get raped and stuff like that.\",\n",
       " \"But around '85 and '86, the connections begin to be disconnected.

What does that have to do with the rape of women in Haiti? We're in Washington, D.C. We're in the United States. What does that have to do with the worker rights of women employees who clean buildings? I mean, connections were no longer made. They were not being encouraged. In fact, they were basically discouraged.\",\n",
       " \"First of all I would say, to me at this point in my life, 2005, age 54, age 54, that I think that on certain levels, feminism is an ideal. It's an idea and it's an ideal. It's an ideal in terms of what a woman might be aspiring to. She's aspiring to be a feminist. She's aspiring to exist within a feminist world, a feminist reality. It is, um, ideas in regard to what kinds of freedoms, opportunities, how that woman is going to be able to live, what's available to her, you know, what she can access and in what ways, how she's seen and viewed in society, and how that view affects really all aspects of your life and your being. So you are striving for that ever so-called thing freedom. You want to be free as a woman, free as a human being, you want to have no limitations on you as a woman in regard to what you can do, what you can do. You don't want to have limitations on you in terms of what your rights are within the society, how you are viewed, OK. So then from there, it's like, but in reality, this is an ideal because we don't have these things, and these are things that we are struggling for in real basic ways, from how my body is being dealt with, how I have control or lack of control over my body, to what kind of contracts, et cetera, I can enter into without having to have a male force there guarantee whatever the particular situation calls for, to how I am perceived and used in that society in regard to things like conflict and aggression in places where women get caught in the middle, as in rape as a weapon of war. All of these different things are things that women are struggling and endeavoring to change, to bring about the justice in that area, the fairness, the equality in those areas.\",\n",
       " \"I started formally working at the Rape Crisis Center, I believe it was something like October of 1974, because Kianga was born in March of '75, yeah, so it must have been ... make sure I don't have my child's dates wrong ... yeah, I think it was October of\\n1974 that I began working at the Rape Crisis Center. And at first, I was just sort of doing all kinds of things, you know, doing a little hotline stuff, a little community education stuff. It wasn't all ... and really, I think they were sort of preparing me for Nancy's job, the general administrator, because she was going to leave, and after she left, I became general administrator. ROSS: OK. What was going on in your thinking about black women and the women's movement at the time? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh, child, a lot of things. First of all, I mean, I was very passionate about the issue of rape and sexual assault and women being helped. I was very disturbed by what seemed to me to be the lack of a presence of black women and women of color in the movement. But certainly many of our clients were black women. So what was going on in my mind was one, how to serve women and two, how to get more women of color involved in the Rape Crisis Center and get the Rape Crisis Center more connected with the community, beyond what it was. It was also, initially, in the beginning, it was a learning time for me, you know, to learn exactly what is feminism. You know, how do people define feminism? What is the scope of feminism under that definition? Learning more about pornography, because I'd never really thought about pornography ... you know, nasty men read pornography at night when nobody's looking, or something. I mean, in terms of thinking of it as an industry that disempowered women or, you know, devalued or objectified, all of that. Those were not really words in my vocabulary or concepts, you know. So my first months at the Rape Crisis Center, first year, was a learning process for me, too. Learning more about feminist thinking and what the issues and the politics of it was. And always trying to see how it fit and integrated in my community, because I certainly saw the urge to try to make people split and choose. If you're black, you can't be a feminist. If you're a feminist, you're not black. If you're for the women's struggle, then you can't be for the people's struggle. If you're for the people's struggle, then how can you isolate out just the women. All that craziness, you know, just trying to navigate my way through it, figure out what the heck was going on. ROSS: Name some of the black feminists who may have influenced your thinking, you may have encountered in the mid-70s. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Oh. I mean, certainly people who I was reading, that came more toward, I guess ... I'm trying to think. When did I first read something from bell hooks and something from Audre Lorde? I don't think that I knew a lot of black women, because I hadn't really ... in the rape crisis movement at that time, hadn't really come across, you know, hardly any other black women. I mean, I knew about New York Women Against Rape and so I knew some of them had to be something, somebody had to be black or Puerto Rican or something like that. But I didn't really know a whole lot about who the women were. Of course, I mean, I heard of like the star feminists at the time, you know, Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan and, um, Bella Abzug and Flo Kennedy, you know, I'd heard of, but I didn't really know a lot about that. ROSS: So at the time, we're talking about '74, '75, '76, what was the Rape Crisis Center doing vis-Ãƒ -vis black women in terms of outreach to or work with or ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Talking about it. Even though they always made a concerted effort to bring black women onto the staff, they really felt that going into the schools or education should be a black woman, because that's mainly who was going to be in those schools, that that was in the staff, there should be black women. There was really a problem recruiting. There seemed to be a problem to recruit black people onto the board of directors, you know, who came or who actually stayed. So for the most part, most of the time, for a really long time, the board was always ... basically, it was white, as was, now, in '76, when we went with CETA and VISTA, you know, and CETA was the concentrated employment program [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act], so that brought us quite a few women of color, and then VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, that brought us ... so that was the time when we had the largest women-of-color staff. We had Latino women, because we wanted to do work in Addams, which was a predominantly Latino community, to assess the attitudes about rape and what kind of services and what people did there, and the same in the black community. So, we had, like, three or four Latino sisters and about six black women that came on specifically through CETA and VISTA. I think the main way that the Rape Crisis Center at the time was reaching the black community was through the services provided for clients. They were just always aware that they were very lacking and very short in terms of the relationships and the networks et cetera to be a crisis center in the District of Columbia.\",\n",
       " 'One of the reasons that I made a conscious choice to go ahead and deal with the Black United Front was because what I had found, was that in the time I had worked at the Rape Crisis Center, I had really developed some negative feelings about men, and I found it kind of coloring my attitudes, you know, because I had so much rape and so much pornography and domestic violence, and harassment, you know. It was, like, put them all in a plane and send them somewhere by themselves, you know.',\n",
       " \"So I was very much centered in, staying in, things that had to do with women and children. At the same time, I was moving more into, within the social service realm, in terms of nonprofit but in terms of funding and ways that people looked at things that were much more systematized and much closer to where politics began to get more and more vacuumed out of the conversation, you know, out of the programs, really, in many ways, out of the expression of the staff. The freedom to really hook the work aspects, the political aspects and the organizational and everything, as I did at the Rape Crisis Center, was not there. At the Rape Crisis Center, I practically did whatever it was I needed to do to advance the work of women, to advance the work of the Center, period, you know. So it didn't have restrictions on being able to go to this conference or work in coalition with this group or do this or do that.\",\n",
       " \"So that is how ... that is who Michelle was. She was the community education coordinator. She did a lot of the work of creating the first materials that were used for education and her job was to go out in the D.C. public schools and do presentations on rape and prevention, and that is what she did. ROSS: Did she go on to become the director? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No. She did not. Michelle actually left the Rape Crisis Center and she went to My Sister's Place and became the director at My Sister's Place, which was a shelter for battered women and their children.\",\n",
       " 'TOURÃƒÂ‰: I did do a lot of things at the Rape Crisis Center, speaking with all humility and truth. Once I came back, I became the director for community education. That\\'s the job that I held. That\\'s the position that I held until I left. I brought Anti-Rape Week into the Rape Crisis Center, something I\\'m really proud of, because it exists today under a different name, but ... ROSS: What was Anti-Rape Week? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Anti-Rape Week was a massive education week where there were all kinds of workshops, seminars, film showings organized, and we advertised and people would come out to events. So it was to build education to raise prevention awareness, and to recruit people into an awareness of, and hopefully support for, the Crisis Center and to take a look at and become advocates for the issue of sexual assault, rape. So we did Anti-Rape Week, and then the women who were a part of FAAR, Feminists Against Pornography, if that was the right name, organized. The Rape Crisis Center had actually worked and organized the first Take Back the Night march in D.C., which I think was in 1978. I think it was in 1978. And then, the following year, I organized Anti-Rape Week. I don\\'t think we had a march that year. Then the following year is like when Feminists Against Pornography picked up and decided that that was going to be one of their major things that they would do every year was organize a Take Back The Night march and the Crisis Center would work with them, so we coordinated so that the Take Back the Night march became a part of Anti-Rape Week, either the beginning or the end, you know, a major activity. [As a member of Feminists Against Pornography, Marty Langlen, a white woman, was central to this organizing effort. She also became a member of the Rape Crisis Center board of directors. Another woman with Feminists Against Pornography who did a lot of work was Clarisse.] And Anti-Rape Week evolved into Rape Awareness Week, and then as the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault took up rape awareness, and ultimately had Rape Awareness Month, which the rape crisis centers across the country pretty much observed and organized for that in their communities. The hassle-free zone. There was a lot of street harassment going on in D.C. There was a sister named Linda Leaks, not was, she is, who was in school at the time and she was making a film on street harassment, and she was so impassioned about it ... ROSS: She is a black woman. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Linda Leaks is a black woman who was making a film on sexual harass[ment] ... street harassment, and Linda was so impassioned about it that she also created a t-shirt to stop violence against women, you know, verbal abuse of women. Well, at the time that she was doing that, dealing with the street harassment and kind of strategizing around how to combat it and how to respond to it, white women were also doing some organizing and they had come to the idea that they wanted to make Dupont Circle ... in D.C., Dupont Circle was, is an area that is sort of a hub area for the commercial district downtown and people come there and they eat lunch and walk through, and then, it\\'s part of the social life at night. So there\\'s a lot going on in Dupont Circle and around Dupont Circle. So you can get harassed walking through there or sitting in there and trying to eat your lunch, and all of that. So a group of white women had decided they wanted to be able to not be hassled in Dupont Circle, so they wanted that to be, you know ... My idea was that they could not take Dupont Circle and single out Dupont Circle as a place not to be harassed, that if we were going to try to have a campaign, we needed to wage a campaign to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. So that you would have the right, wherever you were, not to be \"Hey, baby, hey, mama,\"\\x9d all of that kind of nonsense ... \"What\\'s your sign? What\\'s your name?\"\\x9d ... all of that, that you wouldn\\'t have to deal with it. So, we [joined forces and] entered on a real struggle to make D.C. a hassle-free zone. We met with the police, you know, because we wanted to have penalties. We wanted to have it written in law somewhere, you know, penalties around this whole thing. And we worked on it for about two years, but we just couldn\\'t really make it happen. It was too big. But in the process, there was a lot of education. We used to have what were called speak-outs, and we\\'d just be different places, at a Metro stop on a Friday, in Dupont Circle on a Wednesday, maybe down at the Federal Triangle on a Monday, Easter Market, various places, to do rallies, where people would speak out about street harassment, sexual harassment on the streets, and we would make the interconnections between street harassment and pornography and rape, you know. And we did a lot of consciousness-raising and a lot of great organizing as a result of that in those two years that we worked on that. Also, doing the organizing of the Take Back the Night marches and the Anti-Rape Weeks that we did for a number of years, that is one of the ways that I was able to bring a lot of women of color into the Rape Crisis Center, that came to work and organize around these different issues for Anti-Rape Week. More women of color than the Rape Crisis Center had ever seen collectively in all the years prior to that. Women came in and it was a very exciting process. They volunteered to be on the hotlines and as a result ... and that was all, that was really good stuff. ROSS: Describe, if you don\\'t mind me backing up just a little bit, what was going on that caused the 1980 conference to happen, or am I going too far? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, no. You\\'re speaking about the first conference on Third World Women and Violence. It came about because there was that need to pull women of color together, to acknowledge that violence existed in our communities, to talk about the forms that it took, the kinds of responses that we got to it, the attitudes that existed there, and what needed to be done. It also came about because women of color who were doing this work desperately needed to know each other. We needed to network. We needed to build and consolidate a network. And so, though that conference brought about 80 women, you know, in total, however, they came from a lot of different places, and we were able to find out about, like Fatima Cortez, with that little rape crisis center up there in New Bedford or someplace in Massachusetts. We had the New York Women Against Rape come down, that\\'s when we had the great honor to meet and develop our first relationship with Sandra Comacho, Ch\\nrrÃƒÂ\\xade Moraga, and those women from New York. The women from Boston came, and so we first met ... not Barbara ... I\\'m trying to remember ... Barbara Bullette was there. It was the woman who was the therapist, Ruth something [Ruth Hall]. But a few women came from Boston. We all ... that was the start of the building and continuation of a network. Those were the first steps towards that. So that was really, that was really a great, a great conference. And it was really exciting. It was part of ... we made it a part of Anti-Rape Week and it was great, and it was where we got ... I believe it\\'s where we got our famous logo. ROSS: Tell me about that logo. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Our famous logo which represented ... the Rape Crisis Center had this beautiful logo that ironically, it was done for us by a brother named Malik Edwards, who used to be one of the artists for the Black Panther Party, who drew the pictures for the Panther Speaks newspaper, and we asked Malik if he would develop ... wait, let me back up for one second. I\\'m running two thoughts together. I\\'m running this thought ... no, I know what it is. The Shanti Dolls. I was getting ready to run it in with ICAW [International Council of African Women] and the Dolls that Beverly did for us. OK. Put that on the side. Malik, who had been in the Black Panther Party, we asked him if he would develop a logo for us for our conference, the Third World Women and Violence Conference, and he drew for us ... he came back with four fertility dolls, one looking Asian, one African born in America, one First Nation, and one Latina, and it was the details on the fertility dolls that determined the ethnicity of each of them. And so these four together represented women of color, and made an extremely powerful statement. So it became the logo for the Third World Women and Violence conference. And then our very next edition of the Rape Crisis Center publication that dealt with myths and facts about rape, we used that logo on it. And it was just ... what can I say? It was a success. Anyone whoever looked at it loved it. Of course, there did come a time, somewhere down the road, where there was conflict when someone said, \"There\\'s no white doll, you know, there\\'s only four, there should be five dolls.\"\\x9d Why? \"There\\'s no white woman.\"\\x9d Well, the logo didn\\'t change. It didn\\'t expand, you know, under the creator\\'s vision. That was his vision of what we had asked him to do for that conference, so that was that. So that is how the Third World Women and Violence ... it\\'s called the First National, because it actually was the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence, and we were honored to be the people to put out the call for that. [Deirdre Wright, who worked at the Rape Crisis Center at the time, was conference coordinator.]',\n",
       " \"TOURÃƒÂ‰: OK. As I recall, there was, in 1970 or '71, there was this big women's speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the women's movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillen's apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My Sister's Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power. All the things that everyone criticized women for having as part of an analysis of violence against women ... who now, the mainstream themselves, embrace a large part of that ideology or that perspective, that politic, or that analysis, however you want to say it, about that, that they didn't do before, Post Traumatic Stress [Disorder], you know, rape trauma syndrome, just any number of things that the women were saying in '72, '73, '74 went on for so long, that the more traditional society, law enforcement, medical, social, was rejecting all of that, have now had to come around and embrace it. And not just embrace it, but kind of like take it over and claim it, like this was their thinking, their theory, all along and all the time, which was just so outrageous, such revisionist history. In that house, in that apartment on Q Street, and it stayed there in Jackie's apartment for some time. And from Jackie's apartment, the first place it went was to that small, two-room across the street from Lincoln Junior High School on 16th and Irvin Street. ROSS: OK. There were some feminist magazines, and wasn't there a group called the D.C. Area Feminists Alliance? TOURÃƒÂ‰: FAAR. ROSS: Feminist [Alliance] Against Rape. Tell me about FAAR and ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, FAAR was ... some of the women in FAAR were from the Rape Crisis Center who had left the Rape Crisis Center, wanted to do something else or do some things differently, and so there were people who were interested in publishing, and they got interested because there was also a quarterly scholarly magazine called Quest. Quest preceded FAAR, you know, because it was more scholarly, a quarterly and all that. So you had women who worked on Quest who were interested in putting some focus around rape and so forth, and you had women who had been at the Rape Crisis Center who had an interest in putting out written materials and educating in that way, so they got FAAR magazine. The thing I'm trying to remember, because it had two incarnations, as FAAR and as Aegis magazine. And actually, what I think is that they became FAAR the collective. The magazine was Aegis magazine, and it carried articles and information on sexual assault and theory around sexual assault, you know, all kinds of tips, this, that, the other, different stuff, stories, articles that had to do with empowering women and all of that. Later, Aegis joined with ... oh, yes, and of course, dealing with pornography as well. Later, Aegis joined with domestic violence and half the magazine would deal with issues related to sexual assault, pornography, and the other half would deal with issues dealing with battering and domestic violence. ROSS: Did you get the sense that in the early years, the people at the Rape Crisis Center worked on other forms of violence that women experienced, or was it just gender-based violence? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It was gender-based violence. However, definitely gender based, although the Center did recognize that it was possible for a man to be raped, it was obviously not the primary focus, but there was certainly the acknowledgment that men could be sexually assaulted. You had individuals who worked at the enter who may have had involvement and ties into other movements around other issues, but the Crisis Center was strictly dealing with rape and had its hands full to deal with that, because in '72 and '75, I mean, the police, everybody, I mean, it was a battle. You know, if we ... it still continues to be a struggle, you know, but it was a battle. It was a war, you know, in terms of they didn't want you to have companions. I mean, all rape crisis centers, now you can have a companion with the woman at the hospital that's from the center. So, Oh, no, you couldn't do that. They didn't want you there because you impeded the investigation by being there. So then it was, like, the only way you could be there was if the woman requested that you be there. I mean, it was all these things, you know. Women asked for it. It was just horrendous. So they weren't just dealing ... they were not really making connections to anything else. They were dealing with the dynamics of gender, you know, and as time moves forward, began to ... around different issues, make connections, broaden out ... ROSS: OK. Now, you're saying that your working at the Rape Crisis Center affected your marriage. In what way did your consciousness that you developed at the Center cause you to re-look at your marriage? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It wasn't working at the Rape Crisis Center that caused me to ... I didn't need Rape Crisis Center. I mean, in all honesty, I didn't need the Rape Crisis Center to help me with that at all. When I was saying, working, I meant working in terms of the finances of it. You know, where if the man doesn't have a regular job or steady job and you do even just part-time, full-time, whatever it is, the dynamics that that creates. No, it wasn't a consciousness from the Rape Crisis Center. It was just the consciousness of, you got to go, because somebody's going to get hurt, OK. And so, I ain't fit for it to be me, so, and you're not leaving my child no place else, so you got to go\",\n",
       " 'TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, you know, we had the bookstore and I had Against Rape, and there was a book prior to Against Rape that was on the topic of rape. And in that area of Northeast, there had been a couple of assaults surrounding the neighborhood where we lived, or where the bookstore was, and we\\'d had a couple of meetings where women could come out and talk about it. ROSS: Who\\'s the \"we\"\\x9d? TOURÃƒÂ‰: We, meaning myself and a couple of other women were Save the People. ROSS: All black women? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes. ROSS: What year was this? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Seventy-four, late \\'73, maybe early \\'74. And as a result, I was on the radio one day, on WHUR, doing an interview and talking about rape and sexual assault, and some women at the Rape Crisis Center were listening to WHUR. Now that in itself is an intriguing mystery. ROSS: Why were these white women at the Rape Crisis Center listening to this black radio station at Howard University called WHUR? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes, it must have been because Michelle was there. So, anyway, yeah, because Michelle said she heard it, so they had WHUR on and they heard this interview, and they wanted to find ... Oh, there\\'s another black woman in D.C. talking about rape. We must find her. And I got a call from, I believe it was Deb Freidman at the bookstore, and asking me ... introducing herself, she was from the Rape Crisis Center, and asking if I would meet and talk with them about ... and I went and I admit, I was curious. I mean, the Rape Crisis Center. I was curious. I went. We talked. I met Michelle. Michelle asked me to go to American University with her and do a presentation. And that, sort of, was the genesis of the relationship with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. ROSS: So describe to me who Michelle Hudson was. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Michelle Hudson was the community education coordinator. She was black, she was the second ... the Rape Crisis Center started in 1972 and so, we are now up to \\'74, so it\\'s only been, like, two years. It\\'s very young. Nancy McDonald is the general administrator ... because we try not to be hierarchical, so we have don\\'t have an executive director, no executive director at that point in time ... the general administrator, who generally administrates. OK, so we had a general administrator, and the community education coordinator. And because Nancy, had ... I\\'m trying ... there was a reason, OK, the point was that the community education coordinator made more than the general administrator, because they based it around need and not just around title or hierarchy. So it was kind of collective sense of in the beginning, it was very interesting. This little tiny, two-room, upstairs, across from a junior high school, Lincoln Junior High School, up on 16th and Irvin Street. They were in a house across the street, upstairs. So that is how ... that is who Michelle was. She was the community education coordinator. She did a lot of the work of creating the first materials that were used for education and her job was to go out in the D.C. public schools and do presentations on rape and prevention, and that is what she did. ROSS: Did she go on to become the director? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No. She did not. Michelle actually left the Rape Crisis Center and she went to My Sister\\'s Place and became the director at My Sister\\'s Place, which was a shelter for battered women and their children.',\n",
       " \"Wow. Well, first of all, I don't know if herstory can say it or history can say it or whatever. I know one thing is that in the 13 years that I worked at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, I served a lot of people and I helped a lot of people. And I still run into people sometimes who say, you know, I remember when you used to work at the Rape Crisis Center. You were my counselor. Or, You were the counselor for a friend of mine. Things like that. Because I counseled a lot of women when I worked at the Rape Crisis Center, and I feel good about that. Also doing the education in the schools, the program, I run into people who say, I remember when you came to my school. You came to Roosevelt. You came to Paul. You came to Hart. You came to Charles Drew. You came to my school. And that was really good. So I feel that I have touched a number of people's lives in a personal way that may not ever get broadcast, and sometimes I think about, What if I had not ever worked at the Rape Crisis Center? There would have been these people who wouldn't have got touched in that way that, you know, that you helped them to be able to heal theirselves and resolve their conflicts so their lives could be better. That's really good. Um, I think that the involvement of women of color at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center, through the organizing for Anti-Rape Week and working with the people who organized the Take Back the Night marches and the very first Third World Women and Violence conference, national conference, held in this country, that though were only about 75 women or so that attended, it was a significant thing for the First National Conference on Third World Women and Violence. I think that I played a significant role in helping to shape and develop a network and a movement of like-minded, feminist-minded, whatever, third world women and women of color in the metropolitan area in doing work in the area of violence against women, you know, kind of coming together to study and to expand around violence against women, because we were looking at sexual assault, domestic violence. We were looking at street harassment, you know, we actually tried to get D.C. declared a hassle-free zone, free of the hassle, sexual, verbal harassment and hassling of women. I worked on the interfamily bill to change the definition and way of dealing with domestic violence and battering, on the rape bill. Just the consciousness of women around being active in gender politics, helping to facilitate this idea that we had to end the silence in our communities, and I think that all of these third world women of color, African American women, women in the Latino community, and so forth and so on, but definitely in the black community, of pushing and making dialog happen in our communities around us when people didn't want to hear it, you know, and challenging people and their ideas about it. So I think, I believe I've made some contributions in that area, you know, maybe helping to extend how people look at violence against women, like [what] we did with the whole braid thing, when they were wanting to fire these women at the hotel because they were wearing their hair in cornrows, you know. And I said that that was a form of psychological violence against women, and even though I had to sort of struggle with the Rape Crisis Center, the Crisis Center was able to initiate and take the leadership to organize a major demonstration in front of the Marriott Hotel down on 14th Street, where we actually had the unions, a couple of the union locals involved, and had almost a thousand people out there in the streets, including Ras Michael out there in the streets to protest that.\",\n",
       " \"we were together for seven years, from the time of being in the Party to the actual time of no longer being in the Party and [Save the People] and ending our relationship, was seven years, and it was just simply that I just simply could not deal with the drinking anymore, the kind of little disappearing acts, just all of it. And also, the issues that kind of go with ... when I started working at the Rape Crisis Center, you know, so one person is working in a job that's not a system job, but it's a job, OK, and you, the male, are not, OK. So then another whole set of dynamics went with that, and it was just ... it just took more energy than I could really deal with.\",\n",
       " 'But here in D.C., one of the larger churches and the minister was accused of sexual harassment. And there were four women, and they were really, really upset and traumatized. And they were directed to, not just the Rape Crisis Center, they were directed to me, to work with them and support them and sit in on some of their meetings and so forth and so on. And this guy was actually charged, you know, with sexual harassment. And in the church, he ultimately, even though it was kind of close, but he ultimately won. Oh, no, not ... you know. In the process, though, working with these women was just really ... it was horrendous. And because the case was in the newspaper and that sort of thing. I was getting criticized, you know, for bringing down a good man, for messing with somebody\\'s reputation or getting into the middle of something that wasn\\'t that serious. It\\'s not like he raped anybody, that sort of thing. And I can clearly remember one day, I was ... two particular occasions. One, there was a man and woman together somewhere up in Northwest, and he said, \"Aren\\'t you the woman at the Rape Crisis Center that\\'s working with the women?\"\\x9d \"Yes, I am.\"\\x9d \"How are you going to just tear a black man down?\"\\x9d Kind of went into this, right? And the woman, the sister who was with him, she kind of pulled him up, you know, she was kind of, like, Why don\\'t you leave her alone? She\\'s ... we\\'re out here doing, to go to the movies. Why are you doing this? kind of thing. Which was the first time that I sort of realized, my goodness, this is kind of bigger than I realized it was. And then, I was walking across Malcolm X Park, and this guy says, \"Aren\\'t you the woman who\\'s helping those women against John?\"\\x9d His first name was John, I cannot remember his last name. I could go back and look this stuff up because I know I have it somewhere. And I said, \"Yes.\"\\x9d And he said, \"Well, what\\'s wrong with you? Do you like men?\"\\x9d And I said, \"No.\"\\x9d And he said, \"Oh, because you\\'re a lesbian.\"\\x9d What I really meant was I don\\'t like men like you, you know, small-minded and aggressive and rude. So, he said, \"You\\'re a lesbian.\"\\x9d And so I just said something like, \"You\\'d better watch your girlfriend,\"\\x9d because he just pissed me off. I don\\'t know. But that was really stressful, and people at the Crisis Center really didn\\'t realize how significant this was that was going on. [The case of a woman suing a minister became a major polarizing issue in the black community.] Because this is, like, an out-in-the-open thing around sexual harassment, verbal sexual harassment stuff. You know, a little pat on the behind, this, that, and the other, that people had always known about in different places where they hadn\\'t come out like that ... ROSS: This was before Anita Hill. TOUR\\nƒÂ‰: Yes, oh, yes. You know, so this was kind of like, out there, so I had to put a lot of energy into it and it was very stressful.',\n",
       " \"I had been thinking about this ... because I'm doing this work, because I'm organizing this program around rape as a weapon of war, it's got me thinking a number of things because of these places where these things intersect. We're talking about rape as a weapon of war, you're looking at all the various places where there is conflict in the world, on the globe, and what that means for women and children, and particularly, you know, what it means for women in these places of conflict and as it relates to globalization and imperialism and fascism, racism. It's very significant. We're in 2005, so we're at the beginning of the 21st century, and at the end of the 20th century, et cetera, so you've been looking at things like what happens with women in conflict, what happened with the women in Bosnia, Kosovo, what's happening in the Sudan, Congo, what happened with Rwanda, Haiti, Afghanistan, El Salvador, Nicaragua. Just sort of start naming places ... Korea, South Korea, Vietnam, the Civil War ... just start naming places, and see and look at the treatment of women and the treatment of children, you know. Why were they treated that way? They were treated that way because they were women. They were treated that way because, in society, all these societies where there's male chauvinism and gender male dominance exists, they're seen as property. So thus, they are used in that way as well to discourage a nation, to make men feel powerless because they were not able to protect part of their greatest treasures of things that they own, you know. That's where we get those sayings like, The hearts of people are not conquered until the hearts of its women are on the ground. That's where, you know, all these different ideas come from in terms of resistance to this, but you see and you know that it's true because, if not, why is it happening? When you talk about spoils of war, how is it that women, who are human beings, become a part of the spoils of war, do you know? That you demoralize a village by raping all the women in the village? That you have an idea that you can improve a race of people, lighten them up, make them more worthy, more acceptable by raping the women and having them rape ... like in the Sudan with the Geneina, where they're talking about, you know, You're too black and we need lighter people in the Sudan. You're black, you're ugly, you know. So you're systematically trying to genocide out a people and bring about a new people ... all of this through the wombs of women. I find this quite disturbing, quite terrifying, as a woman with a womb and a vagina. This kind of bothers me, you know. So you have all these places where these male-dominant attitudes prevail, not just on the level of conflict, but on the internal level within the society where these exist ... in places in Africa where people believe that if you rape a virgin, that it'll cure you of AIDS. It's like, whatever could you be saying? You know, it's this idea in India that if the woman does something she disgraces the whole family and she must be punished, so, you know, we can just set her on fire, because we have to avenge the honor of this family. What are you talking about? These kinds of conflicts that exist even on an internal level within the country, within the tribe, within the society, whatever, you know, women are the ones who are abused, the ones who are traded off and traded for. In a situation where a woman, her husband dies, in some societies where the husband dies so now the woman must marry again, and her family must find her a mate or the husband's brother must step forward and marry her. And all the property now becomes his, you know ... because she can't function on her own without her husband? She might be glad to have the first time to be able to roll without him. But here she is now being passed on. So she doesn't even count. It's her and her property gets taken over to this next person. All these kinds of situations, you know. So in that kind of an atmosphere, you're not necessarily ... not very likely there're going to be a lot of women's centers or battered women's shelters, rape crisis centers, you know, or even kind of support groups that are organizable in an informal way or organized in a more clandestine way, like the Jane Collective used to exist, you know, in different ways. So the idea of being able to have these women ... and then of course in some places, there are centers and there are things, and I guess a lot ... maybe they come out of areas where there are universities, where women have resources at the university level and where the women maybe have more education or something like that. But to be able to kind of work to bring some of that together, so people can create their own, in the way that it's going to work where they are, where they live ... to be able to do that, I think that would be a really good thing, interesting and exciting, whatever, very helpful, for sure. ROSS: So you see your future work helping women in other countries deal with the consequences of rape being used as a weapon of war? Taking your experiences from building the movement to end violence against women here and globalizing it from the perspective of women of color? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I see it as something to think about. I mean, the way you just articulated it, you made it sound so good. I mean, the way you articulated it, it sounded really, really, really good and it sounded really organized ... ROSS: Well, I don't want to put words in your mouth. I'm just trying ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, I'm saying, the way you said it, that's what it is, but I mean, I didn't say it like that. So I'm saying, you know, the way you said it, it sounds really good, the way you said it. It even sounds fundable, the way you said it.\",\n",
       " \"TOURÃƒÂ‰: I left the Rape Crisis Center in August of 1988. To say burnt out is not adequate. It does not begin to describe ... I like to say I was nuked. I was nuked. I just could not ... it had been 13 years, and the last five years of that time had really been ... the last four years of it had really been a lot of battling. A lot of things had changed in the Crisis Center, in the women's movement, in the movement against violence against women. As organizations were striving for the dollars, for the funds, then out came the cry of professionalism. We must be professional. So the whole look and feel of the various centers and shelters began to change. The collective ... the idea of collective running and sharing of responsibilities and those sorts of things, were falling to the side, that seeming need to conform without seeing that at the time, the more we conform, the more we were required to conform, and the more we conformed, the more we were required to conform. And so, you had situations in some places where people who had previously been the executive directors were asked to step down because they were lesbian, they were too radical, they didn't fit the image for a professional. The boards of directors became more professional, and please understand me, there's nothing wrong with being [professional] organizers. It's a matter of what you define professionalism as being. When it becomes such that you are not just dealing with policy, but you are taking the policy in a direction that's basically the opposite of where it has been, or when you begin to micromanage staff, you begin to have problems. You have a lot of problems. ROSS: Would you define as being more or less feminist, the professionalism? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Less feminist. To me, less feminist. ROSS: Why? What would you define that? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I would say, because it became less political and more social-service oriented. You know, provide the services. And of course, there's got to be services. I mean, what's the ... you need a hotline. You need companions to go to the clinic or the hospital and be able to be there. You need the hospital to agree to allow you have a room there in the hospital where you all can function out of. But when, OK, during that time when more people and more ideas came into the Center -- you had asked the question earlier about making connections with other issues and other movements. That was a period of blossoming, when all that was the kind of ... those kinds of things were going on very strongly, like between '80 and '85, '86 [connections between community organizing, the involvement and leadership of women of color, links with other groups and issues]. But around '85 and '86, the connections begin to be disconnected. Stay in your area, you know, this is rape, you know, this is to provide education for the children, talk to people about incest, have incest-survivor groups, have rape-support groups. What does that have to do with the rape of women in Haiti? We're in Washington, D.C. We're in the United States. What does that have to do with the worker rights of women employees who clean buildings? I mean, connections were no longer made. They were not being encouraged. In fact, they were basically discouraged. They may not have been discouraged totally by saying, like, we're just not dealing with that. But if it doesn't get dealt with, if no one wants to talk about it, no one wants to plan around it, no one supports it, it's not getting dealt with. The connections are not getting made. And that was very much happening, that kind of moving away from making the interconnections. We are a service-oriented organization. We do education in the schools and we provide counseling. That's what we do, you know. And we go out and speak at the functions in the community, and raise the consciousness at other institutions, and when I'm saying raise the consciousness, what I actually mean is being made aware of the issues around sexual assault and how to deal with them. And that was pretty much becoming it. So, between board micro-management, not continuing to forge out and make those connections, losing many of the women of color because the issues that would keep the connections were not there, so we were coming to a place of ideological differences and being totally burnt out, because I worked like a Mississippi slave in a cotton field in those years when I worked at the Rape Crisis Center, that I served my community. I was just nuked. I just couldn't ... it was time for me to go.\",\n",
       " \"just in the community in general, if I was working with people maybe around issues, something that had to do maybe with, if it had to do with housing, if it had to do with neighborhood safety, whatever it was, however it was that something came up dealing with women, it always kind of came up with the D.C. Rape Crisis Center. That's the feminists. That's that women's movement. What are you for, you know, are you for the black movement? Are you for the women's movement? Are you for the people or are you for the women?\",\n",
       " 'My sexual formative experiences were not all that great, because I was raped, and when I was raped I was a virgin, so that didn\\'t put me off to a great start. ROSS: How old were you? TOURÃƒÂ‰: I was 16. To me, that made it even more devastating because it was, like, yo\\n\\'re supposed to be \"sweet 16,\"\\x9d you know, so I was really messed up. It was like this dude I was going with and he had joined the service and he had been away for his basic training. He came home in his uniform. He was drunk, and I was babysitting, and I let him come in. And I knew that my mother would\\'ve never approved of me having my boyfriend come over where I was babysitting somewhere. So, you know, that was a bad situation and I grieved that for a long time.',\n",
       " \"OK. As I recall, there was, in 1970 or '71, there was this big women's speak-out in New York, where all these women came and they talked about feminism and sexism and chauvinism and all of those kinds of things. And were kind of assessing, I guess, in a way, assessing the women's movement and identified violence against women as a really big issue, you know, not just ERA, for the equal pay thing, or the right to have an abortion, but violence against women, and out of that, the women who participated in that session, a couple of them came from D.C., and so they decided that they were going to start a rape hotline. ROSS: Do you remember their names? TOURÃƒÂ‰: They started the rape hotline in Jackie McMillen's apartment on 17th & Q Street Northwest, here in the District of Columbia, down in Dupont Circle, with this mustard-yellow answering machine. ROSS: Who was the other woman? TOURÃƒÂ‰: Took training. There was Lois Yankowski, Jackie McMillen, Deb Freedman. She came fairly early on, I believe. Val Jones, who worked with the Women's Legal Defense Fund, very instrumental in getting the first My Sister's Place started and all of that. It was a group of women like that, trained themselves to be able to work on a hotline and take the calls and they developed a very strong political analysis about rape and its relationship to power. All the things that everyone criticized women for having as part of an analysis of violence against women ... who now, the mainstream themselves, embrace a large part of that ideology or that perspective, that politic, or that analysis, however you want to say it, about that, that they didn't do before, Post Traumatic Stress [Disorder], you know, rape trauma syndrome, just any number of things that the women were saying in '72, '73, '74 went on for so long, that the more traditional society, law enforcement, medical, social, was rejecting all of that, have now had to come around and embrace it. And not just embrace it, but kind of like take it over and claim it, like this was their thinking, their theory, all along and all the time, which was just so outrageous, such revisionist history. In that house, in that apartment on Q Street, and it stayed there in Jackie's apartment for some time. And from Jackie's apartment, the first place it went was to that small, two-room across the street from Lincoln Junior High School on 16th and Irvin Street. ROSS: OK. There were some feminist magazines, and wasn't there a group called the D.C. Area Feminists Alliance? TOURÃƒÂ‰: FAAR. ROSS: Feminist [Alliance] Against Rape. Tell me about FAAR and ... TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, FAAR was ... some of the women in FAAR were from the Rape Crisis Center who had left the Rape Crisis Center, wanted to do something else or do some things differently, and so there were people who were interested in publishing, and they got interested because there was also a quarterly scholarly magazine called Quest. Quest preceded FAAR, you know, because it was more scholarly, a quarterly and all that. So you had women who worked on Quest who were interested in putting some focus around rape and so forth, and you had women who had been at the Rape Crisis Center who had an interest in putting out written materials and educating in that way, so they got FAAR magazine. The thing I'm trying to remember, because it had two incarnations, as FAAR and as Aegis magazine. And actually, what I think is that they became FAAR the collective. The magazine was Aegis magazine, and it carried articles and information on sexual assault and theory around sexual assault, you know, all kinds of tips, this, that, the other, different stuff, stories, articles that had to do with empowering women and all of that. Later, Aegis joined with ... oh, yes, and of course, dealing with pornography as well. Later, Aegis joined with domestic violence and half the magazine would deal with issues related to sexual assault, pornography, and the other half would deal with issues dealing with battering and domestic violence. ROSS: Did you get the sense that in the early years, the people at the Rape Crisis Center worked on other forms of violence that women experienced, or was it just gender-based violence?

You know, if we ... it still continues to be a struggle, you know, but it was a battle. It was a war, you know, in terms of they didn't want you to have companions. I mean, all rape crisis centers, now you can have a companion with the woman at the hospital that's from the center. So, Oh, no, you couldn't do that. They didn't want you there because you impeded the investigation by being there. So then it was, like, the only way you could be there was if the woman requested that you be there. I mean, it was all these things, you know. Women asked for it. It was just horrendous. So they weren't just dealing ... they were not really making connections to anything else. They were dealing with the dynamics of gender, you know, and as time moves forward, began to ... around different issues, make connections, broaden out ... ROSS: OK. Now, you're saying that your working at the Rape Crisis Center affected your marriage. In what way did your consciousness that you developed at the Center cause you to re-look at your marriage? TOURÃƒÂ‰: It wasn't working at the Rape Crisis Center that caused me to ... I didn't need Rape Crisis Center. I mean, in all honesty, I didn't need the Rape Crisis Center to help me with that at all. When I was saying, working, I meant working in terms of the finances of it. You know, where if the man doesn't have a regular job or steady job and you do even just part-time, full-time, whatever it is, the dynamics that that creates. No, it wasn't a consciousness from the Rape Crisis Center. It was just the consciousness of, you got to go, because somebody's going to get hurt, OK. And so, I ain't fit for it to be me, so, and you're not leaving my child no place else, so you got to go.\",\n",

But now, I do remember that, just as I remember that when we went to Kenya for the end-of-the-decade conference, that our rape reference, the one on the myths and the facts and everything, that we had had the logo done with the faces of women of color, that it had spread itself so many places, and that w\\nen we went, there were people who were somewhat familiar with it. But that once we returned, we just got all kinds of responses from people who had taken it back to their countries and were like using the logo and just using the information.

One of the reasons that I made a conscious choice to go ahead and deal with the Black United Front was because what I had found, was that in the time I had worked at the Rape Crisis Center, I had really developed some negative feelings about men, and I found it kind of coloring my attitudes, you know, because I had so much rape and so much pornography and domestic violence, and harassment, you know. It was, like, put them all in a plane and send them somewhere by themselves, you know. And of course, it's like, OK, you know, your brother's going up too, your nephews are going, they all are going.

       " \"TOURÃƒÂ‰: Well, there were some exciting things, because I always looked at it that there was the overall women's movement and within the overall women's movement, there was the women-of-color movement, because over time, many of the women of color had found ways to network and get to know each other and meet each other and do things. One of the things that we were involved in before we were even really very much involved in NCASA [National Committee Against Sexual Assault] was NCADV, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, which was much more radical in its thinking and its approach than was the National Coalition Against Sexual Assault. And within NCADV, they had those women of color caucuses, which was so very strong. All of the women, they had the black caucus, the Latina, the Asian, the First Nation, they had all of the ... women of color had caucuses. Well, you know, NCADV was a national organization, so most of the shelters of the country were members of it, and you could see that there were many women of color working in all these shelters, and in crisis centers, which was like something that people just didn't seem to know and didn't seem to get, that there was all this strength here, and [NCADV], they produced a newsletter, as well as doing a women's newsletter. Some of the shelters did their newsletters, and the women-of-color caucus had a newsletter, and it was very powerful. And what I always appreciated about them was how they could meet as individual groupings and then come back together strong as a women-of-color caucus. So women of color were involved in the shelters, in the rape crisis centers, in the health movement ... because they were also working in the health centers, working with women's health care ... there were a number of cases going on from the 70s into the early 80s that raised a lot of consciousness about violence against women, and those cases were raised and that consciousness was raised through women of color. You had Inez Garcia, who was the Latino woman who was imprisoned for killing a man who was trying to assault her. You had Yvonne Wanrow, who was a Native American sister who, her batterer ... she killed her batterer. You had Joanne Little. You had Dessie Woods, who was a case out of the South of a white insurance salesman who had picked her up to give her a ride who raped her and she killed him. These cases ... ROSS: And Joanne Little killed a prison guard, did she not? TOURÃƒÂ‰: No, I said Dessie Woods. ROSS: But I'm saying ... Joanne's case. TOURÃƒÂ‰: Yes, yes, who tried to rape her when she was in prison, yes. So these four cases ... Dessie Woods, Joanne Little, Inez Garcia, Yvonne Wanrow, were cases that raised national attention and brought out a lot of the contradictions, the conflict, you know, was played out and so, it was a very educational process for people who were paying attention. And it was signi\\nicant that these cases, which did so much to further the movement, because it certainly increased ten-fold the dialogue around self-defense, you know, and the right of a woman to self-defense, all of these things.

And then she was fearless when it came to any situation. My father kept very good guns all the time. Once the family was with him in Arkansas and they fired into the home down there because they didn't want to work under him as a black foreman, but he always had guns. Ever since I have known him, he had good guns. And so, when we moved to the country, the whites would just walk up to a house and insult a black woman or tell her to come go with them and the husband couldn't do anything about it and all that kind of thing. They didn't come up to our house, unless they were way down in the field and they would keep hailing and hailing until they knew that you heard them. Then they would come up to the house. But they didn't trust my mother or my father with those guns. I'm very different. I don't touch a gun. And one of my brothers doesn't bother with guns, but the other one, the physician, he keeps his guns. I had a friend that died and had a very nice gun, I gave it to him. Because I wasn't going to use it. JACQUELYN HALL: What did your father say about the guns? You knew what they were for? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Well, he hunted a good bit. He never had a pistol, but he had a Winchester rifle, I think what they called a Sixteen Shooter, I know that it had a lot of cartridges in it. Then, he had a shotgun, a very fine one. JACQUELYN HALL: Did he use them to protect your mother, to protect you all from being MODJESKA SIMKINS: No, that was never said. That's what it was for if necessary. Because the night that that mob came to the house in Arkansas, one of them eventually was shot. I was quite a little girl, but I remember it just as though it happened last night. And when that one was struck, the crowd dispersed immediately. You don't have to hit but one of the fellows in a mob.\",\n",
       " \"MODJESKA SIMKINS: I don't know, except that they realize, as the women in the old Interracial realized, that &#8230; you see, back there, when they first started that Interracial, it was not only against lynching, but fundamentally it was against the white men telling that lie all the time that they had to protect their women just as though the women didn't know when to say no and when to say yes. JACQUELYN HALL: And that came up in the meetings? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Yes, that was understood. That's one of the things, if you look back into the establishment of the old interracial movement here in Atlanta and some white women in other places &#8230; you see, white men always said that they were protecting white womanhood and they wanted to keep them pure. And they cloistered their women. Even in slavery, they would cloister their women, but they would go out and have babies by the slaves. And then, often these men in these prominent white families had their black paramours that their families knew about, because they didn't want to violate these young white women that were in those families. And even during slavery, some of the most beautiful black slaves, mulattos, were sold into the slave markets of New Orleans where they were bought to be mistresses of a number of sons of these masters. And of the masters themselves. And Thomas Jefferson had two or three daughters sold down there as slaves. JACQUELYN HALL: In the meetings of the Interracial Commission, did the white women talk about this situation? MODJESKA SIMKINS: No, it was known. They didn't talk about that. I don't remember that coming up, but I do know that when you look back into the history of it, that's what started it. They became incensed because the men were always talking about them just like they were helpless, you know, snivelings. And they knew that a lot of times, they were lying. And then, some of them felt that it was a reflection on their intelligence. And then, a number of them knew that their men were lying. Many times, when they did this and were going on like that, they realized that &#8230; although I never heard this said in a meeting, I've had it expressed to me otherwise, that a lot of this thing that men were talking about protecting them from black men was because they knew how they were violating black women and they just thought that the shoe would turn the other way. JACQUELYN HALL: Did you have that expressed to you in private conversations? MODJESKA SIMKINS: Just talking like we are now, or maybe two or three people together. And very often, as in the case that I told you about my grandfather, it was known by the whites around there that he was going with these black women. And at the same time, they wanted to kill a black man that went with a white woman. And although prior to, I think it was 1895, when Ben Tillman started &#8230; with Ben Tillman's regime in South Carolina, there was no Jim Crow on the trains. Blacks and whites went to dances together. I've had an old white woman tell me that she had been to dances many nights where Negroes were with whites. They would visit each other's homes out on the plantation like that during Reconstruction and after Reconstruction. And then, they brought in these Black Codes.

After freedom, his mother worked as a nursemaid in a white home there in Columbia. And she became pregnant by the father of this family and my father was a result of that union. And he never, although he should have, he never fully forgave his mother for that. The result was that my mother, who was the daughter-in-law, naturally, of his mother, she understood her better and my grandmother was devoted to my mother. My father never was abusive to her, but yet, he was cold. He was a man that had very high principles, clean-cut, honest, and very high principles. And he just, although the girl being a teen-ager was evidently the victim of circumstances, he never quite got over it. And so, although we were born in the city, my father early decided to take us into the &#8230; to buy some land on the outskirts of the city, which has now just about come into the city and is very valuable, you know, as the city has moved out. Because, at that time, he said that there was nothing for a young girl to do if she had to help the family out, except work as a nursemaid for white families. And he said that he wasn't going to have his daughters working in one of those homes. You see, that stayed with him. And so, he bought this farm land outside of Columbia and he said that he wanted his children to learn how to work and to know the value of a dollar, but he was not going to have them working in a white home. I've never thought that he hated whites, but this particular thing stayed in his mind.\",\n",

       " 'MODJESKA SIMKINS: I can\\'t fully assess it. I could just say that I don\\'t think the South would be the same without what they did, because they opened the eyes of a number of people. The thing that the political power structure had against the organizations of that kind was the fear that they would bring the black and white mass together. And the power structure has always feared the combining of the forces of black and white masses. I can remember the first meeting of the Southern Negro Youth Congress I went to in Knoxville where there were miners, people in brogan shoes, overalls, just like they wear jeans around here now. The average person didn\\'t think of wearing them then unless they were going to the field or going to the mines. And those fellows came out there with brogans, and overalls, and sunhats, and all of them were working and planning together. Well, the first thing they did when they got a chance was to red smear and disrupt the movement. Now, I think if the Southern Negro Youth Congress, for instance, could have gone on, there would have been a very great change in the South because the younger people would have worked together better. But the power structure doesn\\'t want that. They don\\'t want poor whites and Negroes getting along together. There\\'s always been the effort, either obvious or subtle, on the part of the reigning element to keep the forces of blacks and whites apart. But they built it on the sex angle. They always say, \"They\\'ll rape your women. They want to marry your daughter.\" But they weren\\'t thinking about that. They didn\\'t care any more about a poor white than they did about a Negro. And they still don\\'t. They just give them a little more deference because he\\'s white like they are, but they don\\'t give a damn about a poor white. They\\'ll exploit him just like they will a Negro. I\\'ve seen it. I know what I\\'m talking about. So that was their affair. Why do they have to worry about Negro men and their women? If they hadn\\'t power enough to hold their women, if somebody could take their women from \\'em,, why, they ought to take \\'em. You see? Just like I hear people say sometimes if a woman can\\'t hold her husband why would she want to get mad with somebody else for taking him? She ought to be able to hold him, treat him right, give him good food, take care of him. You never find, for instance, as I heard an old preacher say once, you\\'ll never find a dog leaving home and going to stay at somebody else\\'s house if you\\'re treating that dog all right at your house. He\\'s not going anywhere else. Well, when you find the dog trotting over there every time you turn around, somebody\\'s throwing him a bone over there. He never gets a bone over here, just gets some dry bread and maybe a kick in the fanny, you know? [laughter] So, they use that sex thing. And they have used it as a social equality angle. They wanted to keep those forces apart, and they wanted to see that Negroes wouldn\\'t take your job. When the unions come in, they try to tell whites if you get a union, the Negroes will take your jobs. They\\'ll be making much as you make, or they\\'ll bring your salary down to theirs, and all that kind of stuff. It\\'s to divide the forces.',\n",

       " 'THELMA STEVENS: The afternoon before, late the afternoon before, somebody - I don\\'t know now, I don\\'t remember now who it was,- had come by the teacherage and had called the principal out. It was his house, their house, you see, that was the teacherage. The other teachers just had rooms rented in the house. And they called him out and said a little girl, that was maybe going home from school that afternoon, went on a trail through the woods. And when she got home she told her father that a black man, or surely a black \"boy\", you know, a black \"boy\" had followed her on the trail. That is, he had walked behind her, some distance behind her. He might not have been following her. After all, he didn\\'t molest her, didn\\'t touch her, and didn\\'t say anything to her. Well, the father got all upset. That\\'s what happened. I found that out later. But this was the tale that was going the night before. So what happened was that the father alerted all the men in the community, so they got a big posse out in the woods, and they finally found the so-called follower, the \"boy\", who had followed this little girl. And they just took him out the next morning, out on the hillside by the woods, hanged him to a limb and shot him to death. I mean, it was just as simple as that. That\\'s the kind of lynching that happened thousands of times, I\\'m sure. The courts, and the justice of a trial, just didn\\'t work.',\n",
       " 'THELMA STEVENS: In that same old house, yes. And we stayed there a year, until we had . . . became acquainted a little bit with the community and knew more about the population spread and where the needs were greatest. So then we thought they ought to buy a certain piece of property in a different location, nearer the heart of the community. And so they did, and built the buildings, one big two story building and a big gymnasium. And we had a small playground, and a little worker\\'s cottage where the white workers lived. And the Negro workers lived in the upstairs of the big building. My white co-worker, Dorothy Weber (from Lake Charles, Louisiana) and I were told that we could not live in the big building. Negroes and whites living together in those days would not be wise in the minds of people in the city and would destroy our chance to develop a community center. We moved into the little four-room cottage at the corner of the playground, but had our meals with our co-workers in the big building. We faced acres of cotton warehouses! Police patrolled the street in front of the cottage and banged on our door at all hours of the night \"to use the phone.\" We were far more frightened of the police than we were of the drunks who wandered around at night on the playground. In 1930 - 31 \"bootleg liquor\" was flowing freely \" the kind that drove people crazy. We were both very young and the strain of constant anxiety was too great. Finally, when a drunk tried to get in our bedroom window, we knew we had to move. The Negro community advised Dorothy and me to move for the community\\'s safety as well as our own. If we had been molested in any way, mob violence against Negroes would have broken loose. So we moved into an apartment upstairs in the residence of Mrs. Verdery, one of our Bethleham Center Board members. We had our Negro friends and some of the activity groupd come to our apartment as often as busy schedules permitted. We would (Portions of pages 46 and 47 have been omitted by Thelma Stevens. This is her revised version.) have the kids come over for some of the things they\\'d like to do, have a party for them. So, in one way, we broke the ice.

       " \"And you're talking, speaking about the oppression issues and the intersection between sexual violence. Really neat historically. Michelle Johnson-- You know Michelle. SB: Yes. MB: She is now a Carrboro Board of Alderman. And Michelle was a volunteer at the Rape Crisis Center and eventually was on the Board and was on the staff for a while and she was very instrumental. I learned a great deal from her. She had given me some input, and she really helped us start a Diversity Committee and to think intentionally about how sexual violence intersects with other forms of oppression. Then when we did strategic planning probably either midway or a little more than that when I was at the Rape Crisis Center, we did a big strategic planning process. We ended up with a vision. I was sharing it last week because I was doing a training about a form of strategic planning and facilitating the meeting and I said oh when I was at the Rape Crisis Center our vision was a world free of sexual violence and all other forms of oppression. That may still be the vision. I haven't looked at it lately but very ambitious. And then we tried to focus in our mission on stopping sexual violence and its impact through support, education and advocacy. Thanks to the incredible volunteers like Michelle and Linda Brooks and some other folks, really we did try to focus on diversity in a really intentional way, not just one aspect but lots of different aspects. And we focused a lot on disability issues, we were very fortunate, there was a project going on with the state Office of Health and Disability, and they contacted us and said, we would like to provide you all with funding and support to improve your services for survivors of sexual assault with disabilities. And so they came in and did an assessment for us and helped implement a lot of things. Everything from a disability parking space to Braille on the door to helping us look at how our documents wouldn't be accessible to people with learning disabilities, all sorts of stuff. And they did trainings for our volunteers.\",\n",
       " \"I became very immersed in doing this Helpline crisis intervention. One of the jobs of Helpline volunteers was we served as the first response crisis contact for the Orange County Rape Crisis Center. And for what then was the Orange-Durham Coalition for Battered Women. And so I think of that as my first introduction to the rape crisis center. I'm sure I knew about it in various ways when I was an undergraduate student. But that was my first time contributing somehow to the mission of the center. And it was also my introduction to crisis intervention as something that I really liked being involved in. So after a bit of time being a Helpline volunteer, I ended up going to law school, and I kept doing that volunteer work, and I had been doing it long enough at that point that they invited me to be one of the trainers for the volunteer classes. It was still a volunteer position but I felt like I was more part of that work. So that was my introduction to actually participating in the kind of really excellent volunteer training that I think Orange County Rape Crisis Center still does.\",\n",
       " 'I came back to a job as Assistant Dean of Students and Judicial Programs Officer at UNC Chapel Hill, which was really a huge dream job for me. And part of my job there was going to be training student leaders around how to handle hearings, disciplinary hearings and those kinds of things. Part of it was sexual assault issues and helping to do compassionate appropriate response to students who were survivors of sexual violence and also helping to draft and administer policies around sexual violence. So there had been a lot of controversy on campus around sexual violence at that time or soon before I started. So the issues for the Committee on Student Conduct and some other initiatives that I was involved in really did focus a lot on sexual violence, and in that role within my first year I had been to the Orange County Rape Crisis Center several times because I really wanted to build that relationship with the university. So I would go to the Rape Crisis Center and participate in the volunteer trainings and talk about the university\\'s response, help prepare the rape crisis companions, how, what they might expect if they were helping a survivor through the university discipline processes or other ways the university could support survivors. And that was a really important part of my job. I also was one of the people at UNC that would greet survivors of sexual assault and help them determine what their options were and--. So then seven years into that I was Associate Dean of Students and Judicial Officer. And I had a chance, the Dean of Students had retired, and I had a chance to partially fill in that role for about a year, a year and a half, and I reached a point where I thought I was ready to transition into something different. I had been on one or two non-profit boards and I decided that I was going to consider non-profit management, and I started telling my friends, \"Oh I would really like to work somewhere in non-profit management, maybe somewhere like the Orange County Rape Crisis Center.\" So I started quietly telling friends that, just for more of a long-term plan. I wasn\\'t thinking of it as short term. I remember telling one of my best friends, \"oh and I\\'m going to talk to Margaret Henderson who\\'s the director of Rape Crisis Center and see if I could ever maybe shadow her sometime and see what she does or maybe do even an internship there or something.\" And lo and behold, about a week after I start saying all this Margaret Henderson announced she was leaving. And I saw it literally in the paper, which was really strange. And I thought, \"Oh no, now this is something I have to think about and consider a little bit more quickly because obviously I had been very drawn to the work and to the organization and to non-profit work.\" And then all of a sudden there\\'s that opportunity there that I really was not--, not necessarily prepared for all aspects of it. I had not had a lot of fundraising or development experience. I had not had huge amounts of financial management experience. But I had been immersed in the issues around sexual violence, and I had done a lot of volunteer training and a lot of work with clients and survivors of sexual violence, and I knew the community and I was part of the system that cared for sexual violence survivors. So there was a big piece of it that I felt real confident about and then there was a big piece of it that I was less certain. And I remember they had a really intense interview process. I had to come and meet with three different groups during that summer, and I remember how supportive Margaret Henderson was when I told her that I was applying, and I\\'m sure she was probably supportive to everyone who was involved in it if there were other candidates. So after the intensive interview process where I had to write an essay or something--I think the essay was to tell people why I was interested in the job--I ended up getting the job. So that was how my career at the Orange County Rape Crisis Center began.',\n",
       " 'MB: It was primarily around how cases were handled by the student judicial system. So it\\'s much like some of the dialogue going on now and my memory, I have to be cautious because I don\\'t want to share things that would\\'ve been confidential obviously. That many years ago it\\'s hard maybe to separate, but there definitely was some public controversy because the Committee on Student Conduct was considering all the policies based on input they had gotten from the Rape Crisis Center as well as from some student groups like the Rape Action Project and the, what was the organization called? It might have been called Women Against Rape. WAR\" SB: WAR, yeah. MB: But I can\\'t remember. As [it] happens now a few student groups changed their names so it would be one acronym. It was ASAP for a while, Advocates of Students Against--, Advocates for Sexual Assault Prevention. That\\'s what it was. ASAP. SB: The Feminist Students United is the direct--, there\\'s a direct lineage from ASAP to the group. MB: And ASAP might have been the WAR first and the Rape Action Project. So all that was swirling around when I came to UNC, which ultimately helped. Over my years, the seven years I was at UNC I was not always the direct sexual assault person. There were other people in our office, mainly Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and later Don Appiairus because I was the Judicial Officer. So I tended to do a lot of sexual assault to help train about what it was like to go through the student judicial system. And because we would have gaps in coverage somebody would leave, and then it would take a while to replace, I was the direct person a lot of times, for sometimes as much as a year at a time. But I wasn\\'t always that direct person and so that was always something that stayed with me that that was an interest I was, I wanted to do more on, which was a big part of what led me to the Rape Crisis Center, bringing it back to OCRCC. And actually when I got to the Rape Crisis Center I do think it was good that I had those university relationships but probably for a good while I needed to focus more on building those community relationships. I look back and it\\'s hard to remember exactly, but I probably did less with the university but more encouraged other staff to partner with the university so that I could focus on building relationships with the County, with the Town of Chapel Hill, Hillsborough, Carrboro, and with other donors like the United Way. I remember spending a lot of time my first couple years with United Way because they were restructuring and you had to be part of several committees with United Way. We got some funding through a children and youth committee and some funding through what I think was a self-sufficiency committee for our client work. So it was interesting. I came from the university background, but I didn\\'t do as much with that once I was over with Rape Crisis because the County is such a huge entity. It was surprising to me because I having been on campus for a long time and then you think of the campus as such a big part, but then when you are in a position when you are serving the whole county you realize how much broader it is.',\n",
       " 'MB: I don\\'t think so. I mean I came in to--, because I was committed to being the Judicial Officer. That was my primary scope of work. I definitely came in to be -- neutral is the wrong word--, but objective. One of the things that brought me to Rape Crisis was the desire to be more of an advocate. When you\\'re a Judicial Officer, you can\\'t be an advocate. You have to be really balanced and you can support students who are in front of you and you can help them know what their resources are and where they can go, but you have to really balance that, if you\\'re the Judicial Officer, you have to see the whole picture and make sure everybody\\'s getting fair judgment. Honestly, wanting to be more overtly, do more overt advocacy was part of what drew me to the Rape Crisis Center. Because you\\'re always in different roles. SB: Interesting. It\\'s knowing the whole picture, coming to the Rape Crisis Center but you had to know what it was like to be a respond\\nng party within the system. That sounds like a really valuable set of experiences. MB: Yeah, I mean it was different. For me it was nice to have more focus on one issue. Sexual violence is obviously broader than one issue. So it\\'s very broad. But coming from UNC I was dealing with academic dishonesty; I was dealing with substance abuse issues, alcohol, sexual violence, student crises, suicide prevention, all of this wide range of issues. And so it was freeing to come and focus more directly on one issue that\\'s really important and that intersects with so many other issues in a lot of ways. And that\\'s one of the things I love about the Rape Crisis Center is that it stayed true to its mission and a really focused mission, and sometimes there\\'s temptations to bring issues together which you do to solve problems, but I think sexual violence especially lends itself to getting submerged if you don\\'t have something that focuses directly on it. So I\\'ve been really proud that the Rape Crisis Center has continued to have rape in the name for example. And that was a debate that every once in a while would come up in my years. I think it always does. \"Oh, should we consider changing the name? Should we make it broader?\" And ultimately folks would always go back to the sign on Estes Drive. We were the little house on Estes Drive my whole time there, which is exciting to be here in this nice space on Franklin Street. I still am just amazed when I come in here. And I thought the space on Estes Drive was really nice because the Center had been, I don\\'t know if Margaret Henderson talked to you about that. But they had been in this little old rickety house on Rosemary Street. And so getting the space on Estes Drive was a big deal when Margaret Henderson was there. I had visited there and gone to training. So keeps moving into cleaner, nicer spaces that is good, giving people more of a feeling of self-care, protection, whatever.',\n",

       " \"Mary and I had the distinct experience of going to court at one time to try to keep Rape Crisis Center records private. So that felt like a historical moment. So I joke sometimes when people, people wonder if I can keep something confidential. And I'll say sometimes well, I went to court before to protect confidentiality. You can trust me. I'm not going to spill your secrets. So that was a big thing where we had been served with a subpoena to release some client records and there's a lot of media, and there was a lot of media coverage around that. Bob Epting, who is this fantastic local attorney who is also a pilot and flies small planes ( ). Bob came and represented us for free as we didn't think we should have to release records. So that was an important moment and we got recognized for that work by the NC Center for Nonprofits. Somewhere around here there's a little award from that. So that was good. That felt like we were doing something for other Rape Crisis Centers as well. We also had other board presidents like Shauna Hay and Shelley Golden and Elin Abercrombie and Amy Preble, just really great folks. Most of our board presidents while I was at the Rape Crisis Center came from the pool of volunteers. They had been trained in being a rape crisis companion or being a Community Educator and came at it with that strong training and then rose into being a leader, being a Board President type of leader. That was really important that folks have that grounding. One thing that really stayed strong and still is that commitment to strong training which is expensive if you think about it. It's really hard to do forty to sixty hours of training, and it's hard for people to devote that time. So that was a real commitment the agency had. I'm sure they've tried to stay as close to that as they can. But it got harder and harder because there were a lot of organizations you could volunteer for without having that much training.\",\n",
       " \"MB: I don't stay up on it as much. There used to be more communication, public communication with the folks who were handling the policies directly than I perceive that there is now. But that's just a perception in terms of talking to media and things like that. It seems like over the last few years that's been concentrated at higher levels, and so there's not always as much as much direct communication about what really happens at the student level. So I think that's just a different way of running things than the leadership was running things when I was there. I don't mean the leadership, at the Dean of Students' level--. But seems like the higher levels, that there's less which is ironic because there's also so much social media and that kind of conversation. SB: Like you can follow someone who is head of undergraduate research on Twitter but not--. MB: But maybe not, maybe that person is not going to be empowered to talk to a reporter, which is a different thing. It's like, is social media causing institutions to control their communication more by not having it be a dialogue? I don't know. But we definitely were engaging a lot. Now that doesn't mean that we had everything solved, and there were lots of bumpy issues around sexual assault when I was at the university where we were starting [to] doing more training and things like that. And the Rape Crisis Center had been pushing for us to do a better job. By the time I got to UNC they were already pushing for that. That would be interesting research to look back at some of the cases, some of the around 1992, [19]93 you'd find some interesting news articles. SB: Yeah. Right when the student governments started adjudicating cases under the honor system of sexual assault. MB: Yeah, I don't know how far that went back, but yeah it probably went back to the late [19]80s, early [19]90s\",\n",
       " \"MB: I should say that I, we had an incredible Dean of Students Fred Schroeder, and then Melissa Exum for my last year was the Dean of Students. Then there were always other Assistant Deans of Students. There was Sibby Anderson-Thompkins and Michelle Cofield and Ron Binder did Greek Affairs and Judy Barter before Ron Binder, so there were a lot of people in the Dean of Students office. There was also a Sexual Harassment officer who did more of that Title IX because that was more the staff and faculty. So we networked a lot with that office. So yeah, I wasn't doing everything they are doing. I mean they've expanded. Thankfully they have expanded the Dean of Students' office staff, and they have more staff than they had when we were there. But it wasn't easy. It was always twenty-four-seven because there were so many students and so many different expectations. But we didn't have, it sounds so funny but we barely had the internet when I first started. We didn't have email. There was no Facebook. So there were certain things that take a lot of time nowadays that you didn't have then. You had, we were doing paper letters, those kinds of things. It was very, very different. That brings me to the thought when I started at the rape crisis center. Two people on the staff had email, Christina and the Orange County office. Christina in the northern Orange office had it because they had set up her office fairly recently,\\nin the last year and they wanted her to have email so that she could communicate easily with the staff in Chapel Hill, and Matt may have been the one that had it because he would copy messages for Margaret Henderson.\",\n",
       " 'MB: Well, I mean for me and maybe not for everybody, the Rape Crisis Center when I was working here it really was a family to me. It was, as you can imagine, pretty intense to work in sexual violence. You may work in it yourself. But it\\'s very intense and to do it you develop a lot of camaraderie and really love and support for the folks you work with. So it seemed normal. Maybe it wasn\\'t normal. But a Rape Crisis Center is not just your garden variety workplace. SB: In order to not have people dropping out every few years, which still happens for a number of great reasons you need to have strong, something other than a passion for ending rape because\". MB: Yeah, you need a lot of support and, but I do think that that\\'s part of what makes it hard to stay in for a long, long time. I mean eight years definitely seemed like a long time. It is that intensity of, intensity of the issue, intensity of the work, intensity of keeping a small nonprofit afloat. So kudos to Shamecca and everybody for keeping it going. SB: Forty years, almost. It\\'s amazing because I developed relationships or been friends with people who do this sort of work and this is a twenty year old but only have relationships with people who have done this, this kind of work. Was it strange going out of rape crisis work or--? MB: Oh definitely. SB: Yeah. MB: Definitely. Because, even now it feels strange sometimes during holidays and things where I\\'m not thinking about who might have the pager or should I have the pager or I\\'m not on\"I\\'m not thinking about who\\'s on call. But that is a big deal. When you\\'re working in Rape Crisis Center, you\\'re always aware that somebody is on call. I ran into last week because we have kids at the same school, a man who was a detective. And he doesn\\'t work in that field anymore either, but he was a detective who investigated sexual assault cases and we were reminiscing about being at the hospital in the middle of the night and never sure what the call was going to be and those kinds of things and so it does.

The things that women and children have to go through in the world just in terms of who's on the bottom of the list in relation to hunger. Who's hungry? Who's unemployed the most? Who's not getting medical care? Who's getting laughed at in Haiti when they're reporting being raped in the camp that they have to live in because they've lost their homes? Who's at the brunt end of the police laughing and not responding and not doing something to help them? It's women and children. I'm not sure it's enough progress, even if there is progress. I'm not sure it's at the level of an advanced society. And I think there may be societies in history that have probably just not recorded that they did better than people are doing now on some of those issues.

       " 'GE: Yeah. I started one in California, in San Francisco. There was one group of us, a small group there. A couple of women were flight attendants. Actually, almost all the women I knew either were, or had been, flight attendants. And in fact, I have two friends now who I\\'ve known since we were flight attendants together, who I\\'m still friends with. They both live on the west coast, they both live in the Seattle area. It\\'s funny. And one of them who had been my roommate, her daughters are my godchildren. So we still have that connection. So all the women either were, or had been, flight attendants, who were in this consciousness-raising group. And some of that was also from the union, because some of the women in the union, some of the women I flew with who were in the union, and who were active in the union were more political. And truthfully, it was San Francisco, and so probably as a group we were more feisty and political than some of the other places. So anyway, yeah, we had a consciousness-raising group there. And then when I came back here, I started one here. I think those were really big. I think those were really--. It\\'s hard. This probably sounds inflated and pompous to say that they we were really revolutionary, but in a way they really were. Because it was the only time, for all of us, it was the only time we ever really got to talk about those, or had a chance to even explore with each other, \"Gee, have you ever been to the doctor and they did this to you?\" Or talking about people who had been sexually abused, or raped--. I mean, that was never, ever talked about. So it truly was a liberating experience for people to be able to talk about that with each other, and find out that we had so many things in common, as far as those experiences as women. And the sad part of it was that often it didn\\'t go anywhere. You just shared all that, and then you felt personally empowered, but it didn\\'t necessarily lead to any action, which is always the case with us, with \"lefties,\" right? We talk a lot, but we don\\'t always take action. But it was incredible. It was an incredible part of the foundation of women\\'s awakening, if you will. And I think that some of the women\\'s work that I did in the [19]80s and \\'90s was that way, too. It was kind of, women opening up to each other and being able to say things they couldn\\'t say anywhere else. It was pretty important stuff.',\n",

I'm sure there are horror stories about that time from other people. But for me, it was a time of being totally able to go to a limit that I never dreamed existed, and to understand myself in relation to some things that I never thought about before. And I always have been a little philosophical. I managed to always have been one of those--. And even quasi-religious at some point, and so, the whole spiritual and soul-searching aspects and behavioral aspects of doing drugs and the whole culture thing was fascinating to me, and wonderful.

Even though I thought I knew a lot about women's experience, it was a whole other piece of my political education. And then, also understanding the role of how those things work in small towns, like a beauty shop, how that works as far as what it does for the community in terms of bringing people together, and how it's a place where, it's like a consciousness-raising group. And how much support, and how much that was where women were able to be free. I don't know, I could have written a whole book about that experience. It was a wonderful experience.

       " 'I had a godmother, a black woman, who was very much in her senior years. At that time seniors would be more than willing to take care of neighborhood kids. At the same time there were certain things that, if they felt like they had trust of other people who were around them, they just did. This person that\\'s in their family, they just know they can trust them. They would think that the perpetrators would be living down the street or homeless or someone who may have a mental illness or someone who is a substance abuser. So I was very much protected by the outside community, but as we know, in 2011, oftentimes the perpetrator is not going to be that same stranger from down the street or somebody that you just come in contact with. Sometimes and oftentimes it\\'s going to be someone that you know and someone who\\'s been brought into the family. When you look at some of the stories that Anne Rice [author of the novel, Interview with the Vampire] created for the New Orleans area and you look at the entr&#233;e of the vampire, [for] the vampire to come into a person\\'s home, that person has to open the door. The person has to open the door, and the same thing happened with me. By virtue of me not having the protective systems in place, the door was open for the vampire to come in. When the vampire comes in then, they prey. That\\'s what they do. So that\\'s exactly what happened. I was eight years old and it went on continuously, with this one person who was a relative of my godmother, for the next two years. So I suffered in silence, and to be very honest, at that age, the way that I rationalized what was happening\"I knew it was wrong\"but when I looked at the situation at eight years old and saw how me and my grandmother were living, which was not extreme poverty but still very low income to where we couldn\\'t afford certain services or health care or a car or air conditioning or things like that. Because she had to work so much to try to take care of our rent and she was often gone, [I was] in the care of the landlord sometimes, and the landlord was the relative of my godmother, and they had a son that was considerably older than me. He was already a young man when I was only eight years old. So by my godmother thinking that this family member was going to be someone that she could trust and that we could trust, oftentimes when she turned her back she put me in the care of him and delivered me right into the hands of the vampire. So that meant complete and full access. But because his father was our landlord, I felt the responsibility for maintaining our house was bent on me taking the responsibility for providing for the needs that he had in mind. Even though they were wrong needs, I still felt like it was my responsibility to keep a roof over our head, and so that\\'s why I didn\\'t say anything. That\\'s why I didn\\'t tell. CGD: So what happened to stop the abuse at ten? SG: He finally moved away. It wasn\\'t going to stop on its own. I didn\\'t have the wherewithal to stop it and I was too fearful to tell the family. For one, for fear of us losing our home, and number two, for fear of them not believing me. I\\'m this little biracial child who has extremely low value in the community as it is, so what value do I have? This is my thinking at eight years old, obviously, and so the only reason why it stopped was because he went to college. That was the only reason why it stopped. That was the only reason why it stopped, and I didn\\'t disclose it to my family on my mother\\'s side until I was getting ready to graduate from high school. There was a mental blockage of it for some number of years. Sometimes when children go through extreme psycholog[ical] trauma they block things out. They block out memories in their mind, and they\\'re blocked out for so long. As I began my teenage years, becoming a young woman, I think the way that began to manifest itself was in substance abuse. That\\'s how it began to manifest itself. It didn\\'t manifest itself in terms of sexual promiscuity by any means. I was extremely selective and very protective about that. In fact after the first time that I had sex with someone I went to my dad immediately and told him that he needed to get me on the birth control pill like tomorrow, because I\\'d just started having sex last night. After my dad passed out\". [Laughs] CGD: How old were you? SG: I was sixteen. I was sixteen years old and I gained strength sometime during that time frame, as I mentioned to you before, to confront my perpetrator. I found the strength to do that after I had enlisted into the military and I knew what I was going to do with my life and I felt empowered somehow. I saw him on the street one day. He came back and I saw him and stopped him, and I very boldly announced to him, \"You\\'re not going to do this again. You had the opportunity to do it without any consent from me whatsoever, but I\\'m sixteen years old now. It\\'s been eight years; I dare you to try now. I dare you to try it now. I\\'m taking everything back and I\\'m not going to be silent anymore. I\\'m going to start telling people about it, and you can call me a liar if you want to but it\\'s the truth. I\\'m not going to allow you or any other man or any other person to silence me again and take my liberties from me. I\\'m going to always put that in the forefront of my agenda from now on, so thank you for that.\" Right after that is when I decided that I wanted to start having consensual sex, and so again the early feminist in me decided to choose my own partner. I chose my own partner. It wasn\\'t someone I was in love with, it wasn\\'t someone that I felt very intimately about or was in love with or had any kind of romantic relationship [with]. There was someone that I thought would be the best fit for me, no pun intended. So I went up to my male friend and said, \"I\\'m ready to have sex tomorrow, and if you\\'re ready, let\\'s get condoms and let\\'s go.\" He looked at me and said, \"Well don\\'t you want the sweet romantic stuff and the candles and the soft music and the Keith Sweat playing in the background?\" I said, \"Keith Sweat is not needed. I\\'m ready to have consensual sex and either you\\'re going to be my partner or I\\'m going to find somebody else,\" and he said, \"Okay, well I guess I\\'ll go ahead [Laughs] and get myself together.\" So that was yet again another instance of being sexually liberated, even outside of being a survivor of child sexual molestation. I was able to yet again find a way to empower myself and take control of my sexuality, and my health also by going to my dad and announcing to him very strongly and boldly, \"I need to be on the pill and I need for you to take me. You haven\\'t done anything else for me. I need you to do this. At least protect me from having children that I know I can\\'t take care of.\" My grandmother was completely against the idea of me being on the pill because she was Catholic and so she was very much a conservative[ly] minded woman from the standpoint of family planning and pregnancy prevention. So I went to somebody who I knew would say yes. I cornered him [Laughs] into saying yes. So that was my upbringing, coming up as a young woman.',\n",
       " 'Strategically using civil and human rights language from our reproductive justice framework demonstrated that we were authentically embedded in both movements versus that of our opponents.\" We\\'re in both movements. That also said that our messages provided for our allies in civil and human rights movements to echo. So it was not something that was extremely challenging to bring together other civil rights leaders\"as we still are doing now\"other human rights leaders, other leaders from other social justice organizations. Once they understand the intersection of all that and see that human rights is at the core of all of it, it makes sense for all of us to be on the same team. The opposition is not able to do that. For one, they\\'re basing their argument on a single issue situation, they\\'re basing so much of their messaging around abortion, but if you\\'re talking about leaving women with no opportunity to make choices, it\\'s not just about abortion. It\\'s about preventive means and having access to that. It\\'s about what happens if this is a young girl who\\'s been raped. What happens if this is a trans-woman who needs services? What if this is even a male who needs reproductive health services from a fertility standpoint? So SisterSong is a collective, and as our framework we really don\\'t look at any single sex issues. We look at all issues that are impactful, that means all reproductive health issues, so I look at what I call the trinity: Reproductive justice, in terms of the movement building, there\\'s reproductive health, in terms of making sure that reproductive health services are accessible, affordable, and available to women, and then there\\'s the reproductive rights part of it, to make sure that policy understates that. Policy should also be able to provide not only protection but provision, not just protection but provision too.',\n",

I went there because they paid well. We had a white foreman and everybody was black but me, and we worked night shift. I had told the people who hired me the reason I was in the North.

He was forty or something. I thought he was a hundred.

When we went out that night to catch the bus, the women stood around me and told me that I might be a dumb hillbilly [laughter] but that I had done what I needed to do, and they would take care of me. The majority of them made more money than the men who worked there. You moved up by how long you had been there, and the men didn\\'t like to work that shift, for some reason. I said, \"Nobody else has said anything to me,\" and they said, \"Now that we\\'ve found out you\\'ve got a voice, these other men are going to be trying to date you.\" I said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'m never going to marry.

I think for me the thing that makes me the most aggravated is we\\'re still stuck in this rut of saying, \"Why doesn\\'t she just leave?\"\\x9d And that, number one, is a Victim blaming question. Number two, it\\'s the wrong question to ask. Number three, it\\'s taking the focus of the attention off of him, the offender, and putting it on her. And number four, we don\\'t do this with any other kind of crime. I mean when women are beaten up or sexually assaulted, we blame them, just period. But one of the things I\\'ve started saying when I go do community ed stuff is, \"think about the last time a bank got robbed in your community. And law enforcement showed up to investigate the robbery, and they got the evidence and the interviewed people, and then when they were done with the investigation, they probably didn\\'t go to the bank president and say why did you keep all that money here. Didn\\'t know you were going to get robbed? Do you like getting robbed? We\\'ve been out here four or ...\\x81ve times already. Why do you still have your doors open? I can\\'t believe, you must like this. Do you like to expose your staff to somebody showing up with a gun?\"\\x9d But we don\\'t do that. We just don\\'t. But for some reason we just re...‚exively blame women for the Violent acts of men, and that just, it\\'s so juvenile. And it\\'s so sexist, and it\\'s so wrong because when we do that we\\'re basically giving him a green light and saying, \"Carry on. Keep on going on with your Violent and controlling behavior.\"\\x9d We\\'re just going to dump all the responsibility on her. We require her and the children to leave their homes, leave their schools, leave their jobs, leave their family, leave Interview number U-lOO4 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill Gruelle 14 their pets, leave their friends and go hide out in a shelter. And even that doesn\\'t guarantee her safety. So we expect battered women and children to reconfigure their lives completely around his Violence and rarely sanction him with any kind of comprehensive sanctions. So that\\'s the area. So we\\'ve addressed the law enforcement piece, but I think now it\\'s time to address the larger sort of social response to gender based Violence and start to ask a whole new set of questions.',\n",
       " 'And so it\\'s kind of amazing for me that this is 2013 and we\\'re fighting these battles over sexual Violence against women, physical Violence against women, women\\'s reproductive rights. I mean women are still by a sigm...\\x81cant portion of the population regarded as inferior to men, and I just wonder linguistically what do we have to do to address this. What\\'s it going to take? How many dead women do we have to pile up before we realize that we\\'ve got blinders up or we\\'ve got our fingers in our ears and we\\'re saying la-la-la or both? I guess after all these years working with battered women and seeing the challenges they face that are, the initial source is the abuser. But then the state and the various agencies and institutions that she has to interact with to try to get Interview number U-lOO4 from the Southern Oral History Program Collection (#4007) at The Southern Historical Collection, The Louis Round Wilson Special Collections Library, UNC-Chapel Hill Gruelle 12 help, it\\'s like they drive the getaway car. The abuser commits the act, and then the state allows him to get away with it. So I really don\\'t know what it\\'s going to take. I hope the film is going to make people stop and think and say, \"I wonder what goes on in my community. I wonder how battered women are treated in my court. I wonder how the prosecutors handle these cases. I wonder if law enforcement treat these crimes seriously. I wonder if DSS [Department of Social Services] is punitive towards the woman rather than towards the abuser.\"\\x9d',\n",

The film that just came out The Invisible War about sexual assault in the military had a big impact. So there have been, documentary films throughout my adult lifetime that--I don\\'t know there\\'s something about hearing something come out of someone\\'s mouth combined with sort of the contextualization of the issue in a way that people who don\\'t do the work can\\'t see. Like in Deanna\\'s case, the woman who\\'s in the film, you see her photographs because I take her pictures to the medical school because I taught at the med school for twenty-one years, and I would hold up Deanna\\'s photograph, and I would ask the medical students what they thought Robbie was charged with. And universally they said this is an attempted murder case. And when I\\'d say to them, \"No, actually he was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault on a female.\"\\x9d And it just made their jaws drop because people just don\\'t understand what our laws do and do not say about gender based Violence. So I think doing a documentary film is going to make people, they\\'ll see the images. They\\'ll see what the laws say. They\\'ll see how our state, how the state of North Carolina just shrugged its shoulders and continues to shrug its shoulders around this crime, and maybe it\\'s going to led to an honest and open discussion about patriarchy, about misogyny, about what our laws re...‚ect, which is patriarchy and misogyny. And then these legislators who claim to care so much about the fiscal health of this state will realize that when they turn their backs on battered women and children, we\\'re going to pay for it sooner or later. They\\'re going to pay for it horrendously, but we as a state will pay for it too. So that\\'s why to me documentary film, it\\'s just so, it\\'s so important to do it this particular way.',\n",

Society didn\\'t, which still doesn\\'t quite make sense to me and I\\'ve been doing this work now for almost seventeen years. I\\'m still not sure how as a society we don\\'t keep our children safe and I think that was another turning point for me to realize that, \"Okay I can\\'t do direct services because clearly I don\\'t have children. I cannot take all of these children into my home.\" I was in my twenties. That probably was not going to ...‚y with my now husband either that I was bringing a bunch of kids home.

And that\\'s when I chose, because I had not even chosen a senior topic and so I chose a senior topic and I chose sexual assault because my freshman year somebody was sexually assaulted. I\\'m telling you this out of chronological order because it matters in the scheme of things. So somebody was sexually assaulted by a football player and I, she came to my dorm room and my room is called \"The rec\" and it had R-E-C like recreation center because I went to college with a big TV and radio that\\'s all not here or there [KL laughs], but I went to college with way too much stuff that wasn\\'t really necessary for a college dorm. They didn\\'t know. They knew I needed a TV and radio so they were like, \"Sure!\" 16 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So anyways she came to the rec to tell us what happened and that was my first introduction to rape or sexual assault or knowing anybody who openly said that they were sexually assaulted. And she told us what happened, but she didn\\'t want to do anything. She didn\\'t want to tell anybody. She just needed to tell somebody because she walked into the dorm crying, distraught, what have you. So I said, \"Oh we can do something.\" She said \"Well, I don\\'t want to do anything.\" And so I was trying to ...\\x81gure out what we could do without saying who it was and it was football players. And so I thought we could take on the football players and I did. Needless to say, nothing changed for them. However they will remember that that\\'s when it sparked for me that, \"Oh, there\\'s agencies that do something about this so we should at least have information available for people, for young women,\" and so rape crisis stuff became available in our dorms because I just didn\\'t know what else to do at that point. So that\\'s what I did I ...\\x81gured out who would know what to do. So that is how I chose my senior topic and I interviewed the Rape Crisis Center of Cumberland County and decided, \"Oh this is pretty interesting. Like people can do this for a living and I don\\'t have to be a p\\nychiatrist to actually help people?\" And so I did the paper and, a joint paper actually. I did it on African Americans who were sexually assaulted because then I became intrigued by incest and child sexual abuse and how it became very much a family thing. And of course I really only did African Americans because I was one and wanted to be able to ask my family who clearly was not interested in disclosing all these things. But I really had more of a conversation with my grandmother and my great aunt because I wanted a perspective from them, given everything was swept under the rug then. 17 Monika Iohnson-Hostler So I wrote the paper and I knew I was going to graduate in December and by that time I had already met who now is my husband. We had started dating that last year that I was at school and I didn\\'t know when I wanted to get my Masters then because I knew I wasn\\'t going to take any biology or botany [KL and PV laugh, 25:00]. So I didn\\'t really know what a career choice was. I just knew that I wanted to do something to help people. And the thing that I always will say about Thomasville High School and the Thomasville School Systems, which they knew very little I would say, but they knew how to score aptitude tests and it was right. In the seventh grade a teacher told me, \"You will do something to help people. That\\'s innately who you are and it\\'s what matters to you and it\\'s what is important.\" She said \"You scored very well in all of these other things, but everything came back to people.\" And that\\'s true; it\\'s in my DNA somehow. And so my husband, who is not my husband got a job in a small town in Scotland county as a math teacher and he called me because he graduated before I did and he was like, \"There\\'s a job at a rape crisis center and it is just now opening,\" and I was like, \"Oh, why not?\" So I went to interview with two people and I stood up to walk out and they were like \"So when can you start work?\" I was twenty, I wasn\\'t even twenty-one yet and I was like, I\\'m pretty sure there are some question I should be asking, but since I didn\\'t know what they were. I said, \"I will call you back.\" So at any rate, so we had a conversation and they officially offered me the job.',\n",
       " 'MJH: So I have men on staffhere so I think they are integral to this work. My husband and I went on a vacation with some friends and one of the things he said which I think speaks to my thought on men in the movement, which I might add happened in 1998 right before we got married so I didn\\'t realize that this would be about how I thought men were in the movement. But again I think it matters. I think everyone has a role in this work. I don\\'t think, just like any other major, you know, political or human rights or social justice issue, it can\\'t be stopped by the people who were persecuted. So there has always had to be allies in those that have 29 Monika Iohnson-Hostler privilege and power and that I also believe that those--which are in feminist principles--that you know, that the majority, whether it is men or whether it\\'s based on race or sexual orientation or ability, there is always a privileged side of the coin. And so if those people with privilege and power aren\\'t engaged in the work then we can keep doing the work but we\\'re pushing up against in most cases the people who are perpetrating whatever it is and in my case it\\'s sexual Violence. So the majority of perpetrators are men. We clearly have women who perpetrate, but the majority are men. And so I believe that other men have to hold men accountable because there are more good men then there are men who rape and so if the majority of those men do their work and are allies and really setting the standard--. My husband\\'s a teacher. He teaches math. His job is to still integrate what I do, that it\\'s important that you respect women even before our daughter. And he does that. I tell people every day, \"If my husband could figure out how to integrate sexual Violence prevention in math [KL and PV laugh], you can figure out how to integrate it anywhere. So I guess what I would say is I\\'ve always known the importance of men in the work. But I do have some feelings about it that I think we\\'re going to have to work out in this work. That men have come into this work and I\\'ve said to men that come into the work, they come in and they charge their worth because again that\\'s a privilege that men have. Men tend to say, \"we\\'ll charge $10,000 just to tell you why men should be allies.\" People ask me to come speak all the time, I\\'m like, \"Oh it\\'s free.\" NCCASA doesn\\'t have travel so you may have to pay for my plane ticket, but like those things don\\'t matter because most of the women who do this work do it because it matters and because it is important to them and I 30 Monika Iohnson-Hostler think men that come to this work believe that. But men are also socialized very differently than women and so they ask for their worth. And I don\\'t think that\\'s wrong, but I do think it matters in the work because now we\\'re able to see yet again a disparity being played out in a work where we\\'re trying to move to equality for men and women. KL: Right. MJH: Because the anti-rape movement that\\'s about ending rape but it\\'s also about social justice and equality and liVing in a culture where women and girls are not hyper-sexualized so that they do have, they are coming to the table with some forms of privilege and power that are not associated with being male or of a certain race or a certain dominant group and all of those things I think are interwoven into our work. If I do this work from a place of know that the most vulnerable people to being sexually violated are on the other side ofthe non-privileged side of the coin. So people of color, people that have disabilities, people who you know are female. People who are children, people who don\\'t live, their sexual preference is not heterosexual which is dominant in this culture. Like all of those people are closer to the margin of vulnerability in sexual Violence and we know this based off of prevalence numbers. The amnesty report among Native Americans I think has been eye opening to this country for people who have been listening even a little bit. To see that all of those things matter how we treat people in this country. KL: Right [laughs]. 31 Monika Iohnson-Hostler MJH: Again there\\'s probably not a thing that you can\\'t come up with that I cannot integrate this in. So that\\'s my framework. Right or wrong that\\'s how I live. That\\'s Monika\\'s philosophy.',\n",
       " 'So at NC CASA we\\'re a statewide organization that is a membership organization for the ninety plus rape crisis centers in North Carolina. So every county is served by a rape crisis center but there are about sixty-three court agencies that have offices in about ninety-two counties. But then they have staff covering the other eight counties that there are not a physical of...\\x81ce for sexual assault. So they provide direct services which is what I did in Scotland County for many years. But we do the training for those advocates. We also do law \\nnforcement training on sexual assault specifically so impact of sexual Violence, prevalence and how to interview sexual assault survivors. We also train sexual assault nurse examiners forensic nurses on evidence collection and the importance of the survivor because what they do is scientific and what we do is let them know that that is a human being that is the evidence. And so we provide training there. We also provide training for anybody who needs it. We have a campus consortium which now we have probably over forty campuses who are a part of our campus consortium so they have their own advisory committee of campuses and we provide prevention training to them and with them because a lot of them now have federal grants that they have at their school universities to do sexual Violence or domestic Violence preventions; but we do the sexual assault side ofthings. And we also work with all of the state agencies on writing model policies. So we just wrote a policy on new research because I wrote one in 99. There wasn\\'t a lot of research but now there\\'s lots of research. And we also have an administration, our presidential administration who has this as a priority issue. So of course it helps to have the Vice 24 Monika Iohnson-Hostler president that has a, \"One is too many,\" website on sexual assault that happens on college campuses. So that\\'s a huge initiative for us, which we want to work on with the department of public health. You all interviewed the council for women so you all know they\\'re a funder and we are, statutorily the coalition provides training to the agencies that they fund which are the rape crisis centers. So they fund direct services and we train direct service providers. So there is a lot ofturnover because now that I\\'m older I know that they really don\\'t make a lot of money to do work that is stressful and that absolutely has a high turnover and burnout rate. I just did my ...\\x81rst career fair at my daughter\\'s elementary school and I realized this is not a career that anyone will ever tell you that you can ever have. So I\\'m looking in her yearbook and it actually has where I work, but they asked me to come talk about being a non-pro...\\x81t director and I said, \"Well that is really great of them to put where I work,\" because now somebody knows that is a career. Because even in college this isn\\'t a career choice you\\'d think that you would do. Even women\\'s studies majors, a lot of them think about policy which is now where I now spend the bulk of my time. So that\\'s what we do our work revolves around training and education for direct service providers whether they are rape crisis centers or we call them allied professionals or first responders who would be involved in a sexual assault case, and then campuses. But we also do prevention work, which is also training people how to do prevention so society systematically understands that it is our job to change to prevent children from being sexually abused, not children and not just singularly parents but systems are also a part of that. So we do systems work as 25 Monika Iohnson-Hostler well which is mostly translated into policy. So we do both state and federal policy and so, which there will be a trend here. So in that I\\'m also the chair of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, which I have been for, my daughter\\'s six so almost six years. I know that\\'s a long time to be a chair [all laugh]. But it is a policy making body so all of our work and there\\'s no staff so we\\'re all volunteer so I tell people my 6-10 job which is when I leave here is to work with federal policy. That is in both writing and advocating for it, and that advocacy isn\\'t just to Congress on the importance of passing legislation but it\\'s also to agencies so that they understand why it\\'s important that the policy governs their work. So that\\'s my current focus, as a public policy in legislation.',\n",
       " 'So we have a lot of meetings because there\\'s probably not a state entity that isn\\'t impacted by our work. So that\\'s health, that\\'s human services, that\\'s schools, that\\'s universities, you know, it\\'s department of administration. It\\'s every agency or cabinet level agency that should be concerned about these issues. So we\\'ve done a good job because there is a state sexual assault coalition in all fifty states and territories including Washington D.C. So I\\'m a counterpart in all those states and territories which [cheer in the background from bridal shower, MJH laughs] make up the alliance the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. And so a lot of those meetings are for really helping them understand 26 Monika Iohnson-Hostler where sexual Violence is integrated. So we\\'re in the room so we at least understand that they should be there, but they don\\'t necessarily always understand why I say, \"I\\'m Monika Johnson-Hostler from the North Carolina Coalition to End Sexual Assault\". Everybody in the room doesn\\'t necessarily understand why we are there, so my job is to say why we are there. So if it\\'s funding priorities you know I\\'m there to say to them, \"You know sexual assault does this, this is what prevalence looks like in the school system. This is what prevalence looks like in you know adult facilities or nursing homes or group homes.\" So I always tell people there\\'s probably not a facet of life that I can\\'t probably tell you how it\\'s connected because sexual assault happens across the lifespan and there are no boundaries. And so there\\'s almost not somewhere we can\\'t integrate sexual Violence. And it should be because again to get to, I really do come to work so that there is not a work for me to come to and that can\\'t happen without convincing the rest of the world that it matters, and that we are the only ones that can keep women and children primarily safe. Because you know we have a society that allows perpetrators to continue to perpetrate; if we didn\\'t we wouldn\\'t still be dealing with it so. So that\\'s what I\\'m doing at those meetings, telling them why it matters [KL and PV laugh] and how it fits into whatever they\\'re talking about.',\n",

       " 'I was not as active on the local level, but I joined NOW and all those good old great ones and became a real advocate for not just social workers, but women in those positions, women in the field. So that\\'s been my focus all these years. I\\'m a very verbal person, and so I made lots of speeches when I was with-the next program that I worked in in Child and Family was the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. So that included, as I shared with you on the phone, I think, that agency had sort of a research project that started with setting up a helpline in 1979. The helpline was for women and children to call in and report just to the helpline or just to talk about their abuse, primarily sexual abuse was the target. And that meant any women that had been sexually abused as a child or were still or had been raped or a child that had been molested or somehow been offended sexually. So that sort of experiment or, in research terms, sort of out there to gather data, that following next year, the referrals to the Department of Human Services went up four hundred percent. So that data was used to support getting the funding for a regional research and service delivery system for abuse victims and so that\\'s where the Project Against Sexual Abuse of Appalachian Children. It\\'s an unwieldy name, but PASAAC, and I was clinical supervisor there for six years. So I did a lot of speaking at that time throughout the southeast. And what we did was try to get the various parts of the systems that deal with abuse to talk to each other. Police-if a rape was reported, how do they talk to the victim? What kind of services were available at the emergency center, the emergency rooms? Of course, the Department of Human Services that gave services to children, often they weren\\'t communicating with anybody. The sheriff\\'s department, the police, all of those people needed to coordinate services and learn how to not do further damage because the interrogation, particularly around rape, man, it was almost as bad as the rape sometimes for women. So we advocated strongly for that to change and for a more humane, more private inquiry, and did a lot of training throughout the southeast all the way from Texas to South Carolina, Florida. JW: Was there openness to that kind of change or what was that process like? RJ: What was that process? (laughs) Well, the big resistance, you can imagine, was from [males].We wanted to include doctors and many physicians would not, were the most resistant group. And I\\'m not sure why that was. I think a lot of that was because there weren\\'t very many women physicians at that point. And I think that, number one, a lot of men had not been trained to really see rape as [a crime]. They saw it as, well, did she have any injuries, was she pregnant, and that\\'s it, and not any of the psychological impact of being assaulted that way. JW: Were you trying to get them to report cases? RJ: Yes, definitely trying to get, well, trying to help them help the victim, to take charge, and to talk about it. A lot of women still won\\'t talk about being raped because back then, of course, there was very anti-female [attitude]. First of all, rape didn\\'t exist. Number two, if you were raped, you asked for it, you wanted it, because you wore that skirt too short or you were being seductive or you didn\\'t say \"no\" loud enough. Why did you finally give in? Nobody can [be raped]. It was a lot of old boy things: \"Well, nobody gets raped. If you don\\'t want to have sex then you just say no.\" But the fact that the man was two hundred and fifty pounds and the woman was a hundred had nothing to do with it. So there was a lot of denial of inequities, physical strength and intimidation, and then the women often felt so guilty and so dirty. All she wanted to do was forget it, and so there was not much follow-up for the mental health [treatment]. So as the next project that I worked on, as clinic supervisor at the Sexual Assault Center, which was an agency designed specifically to work with women and children. [The] women that had been sexually assaulted or had been sexually abused as children and were still dealing with the trauma. So I ran a group for nine years for women that had been sexually assaulted or had reoccurring memories. The whole memory thing got really to be an issue. And then, of course, I had staff that worked with children that had been abused, a lot of play therapy and those kinds of things. JW: And what year did you start that? RJ: Oh gosh. I left Child and Family in \\'86-no, I started in private practice in \\'86. I left Child and Family in \\'84. I went with Overlook Mental Health Center for a couple years and then I went in private practice. And when I went in private practice in \\'86, then that\\'s when I associated also with the Sexual Assault Center. There was three of us on staff, four on staff at the time and so I was the clinical supervisor and then we started adding staff. I was there for fifteen years on some level. JW: So how were you learning to counsel people through this when, like you said, rape didn\\'t exist? You were part of that movement to say, \"Wait a second. It does.\" RJ: It does exist and it has more than physical impact on the victim. Well, how were we learning that? Well, learning how to be a counselor, quote, therapist. Counseling usually is around solving problems, defining problems and solving problems in a real sort of one, two, three way. That\\'s my definition. Now therapy is a much longer and more in-depth look at how you reacted to the problem on an emotional level and what that did to your mental health. What has it done? Do you find yourself depressed, staying in bed all day long, or continuing to get into self-destructive, abusive relationships? That takes a long time to figure out how to break those patterns and we\\'re now learning a whole lot more about the brain. If I had time to go, I\\'d be a neurologist. I would study that and how to educate people to train their brain differently. We know that can happen now. We have the technology, and we have the expertise. But anyway, back to how do you learn how to deal with somebody about a behavior or an event that supposedly doesn\\'t happen. (laughs) Well, the first thing you do is say, \"It does happen.\" And again, since we\\'re products of our culture, you have to do a lot of work on yourself, or at least I did, in saying, \"Yeah, that happens and yes, it\\'s not good and yes, most of the victims are women, but also little boys get raped and vulnerable males also get raped.\" So you have to sort of retrain your own thinking about that and disconnect yourself from the common belief system. It has some service in the community to deny certain things and so you have to figure out, okay, if I rock the boat, what happens? What role do I play? It\\'s like the whole thing with women, the women\\'s movement. There was this thought that women, you can have it all. You can\\'t have it all. You have to make choices. You can\\'t be the CEO of a multimillion-dollar corporation and be there every time your kid has a fever. You can\\'t do it. So you make choices.',\n",
       " 'RJ: Well, how has it been slow to change? JW: Or has it been? Has this mostly been a positive story of success? RJ: Well, in some ways for some people it has. I think there\\'s still a lot of, and I\\'m thinking of just a great influence on people\\'s attitudes on sex generally and then, concomitant of that, the misuse of sex to control somebody, which is essentially [abuse]. Rape is not about sex. It\\'s about violence and control, because if you want to have good sex, you don\\'t rape. And sexual overtures to a child essentially, those people, in my humble opinion, do not have power any place else or they don\\'t feel powerful in any place else. So it\\'s not about the use of your sexual self for pleasure or for connection. It\\'s about violence, psychological violence if not physical violence, on another person. So how have we changed? I\\'m not so sure that television and popular media doesn\\'t sometimes glorify non-consensual sex and it certainly, I don\\'t think, creates enough distaste for prostitution and those areas that females get entrapped maybe. I know that some of your audience would probably say, \"Well, there\\'s choice there too.\" Anyway, so we\\'ve both been changing toward appreciation for the individual and individual choice and for women, but we\\'ve also degraded, to some degree, the whole process of sexuality and made it entertainment and/or a power play. It\\'s kind of sad in a lot of ways. I\\'m at the age where I don\\'t want to sound like a curmudgeon and blah blah blah blah, the world\\'s going to the dogs, but I have spent my whole career, adult life, advocating for women and for choice and for equality in all arenas. I don\\'t think we\\'ve got there yet. What is real discouraging at times is to see women who get power and also become abusive and not nice, not helpful, not nurturing. We know of those folks. That\\'s really sad. So maybe it\\'s the power in the human family that\\'s the culprit, not necessarily discrimination based on male-female, but it\\'s on the power group versus the un-empowered. It\\'s possible for us to destroy ourselves as a species. So have we made progress? I don\\'t know, but the human community is very slow. Again, I think our brain is slow to change. And once we get an idea, it\\'s very hard to change back and say, \"Hmm, maybe, maybe the best place for children is not eight to ten hours a day in daycare.\"',\n",
       " \"JW: And in those years, were you getting more engaged in the women's liberation movement?\",\n",
       " 'JW: In what ways has the culture been slow to change around these issues of sexual assault and rape and the violence?',\n",
       " \"No, there weren't. The only Violent repercussions that have happened in Karmapolis ironically was not in the ciVil rights movement. It may have been in Cabarrus County individual things around misogynation when black men who were in relationships with white women and then the white woman got caught and hollered rape, and then there's an individual named Rom1ie Long who's in jail, has been for the past twenty-five years in a situation like that that came from the [19]70s.\",\n",

       " 'LL: I don\\'t think I\". If there was an instance of that I can\\'t remember it. I did have to deal on two occasions with male faculty members who had been accused, both of whom came very close to crying in my office, asking me to stop this investigation, this is not true, blah, blah, blah, but the university was really under a very serious mandate. If you accept federal money then this is how you\\'re going to deal with these kinds of gender or racial or whatever situations, and all I could do was say I\\'m not in a position to be your judge in this matter. I am in a position to tell you that you have created a situation that is intolerable for your colleagues. Both of these guys in effect were denied tenure, they were both in science departments, and there were things they did that I probably could have told them they shouldn\\'t do, but I didn\\'t feel I could really get involved. There is a member of the central administration whose business it is to look into these kinds of issues and I wasn\\'t going to go there but I was not going to cover anything up either, so it was sad. One of the guys\"I\\'ll tell you this now\"one of the things he did, which I\\'m sure he didn\\'t realize at all, but one of my areas of research was nonverbal communication for awhile, but this guy moved into your space, just to carry on an everyday conversation. This would have been uncomfortable for him. He would have had to pull his chair right over to the corner. I spoke with him at a number of public occasions, receptions or something, and in every instance I was aware that what I wanted to do was step back. He was too close. JF: Did he do this to men and women? LL: I don\\'t know. The men never complained; I\\'ll put it that way. The other guy was in one of the sciences and took groups of students every summer to do research in the Everglades. I don\\'t know what they were doing but they lived in these kind of, I don\\'t know what, quasi-dormitories that would house\". There would be a big meeting room and then sort of a sleeping gallery on either side. The facility was owned by the University of Georgia and we were just able to rent it sometimes. But he would walk around in his underpants. It was not air conditioned, they were there in the summertime in the middle of a swamp, and I guess I could understand that, but it really made the women uncomfortable, but I didn\\'t say it. I just said some things are happening at that camp which have got to stop, and he didn\\'t know what I was talking about and I said you\\'ll have to deal with committee; they\\'ve got the report. But what I had to do in order to satisfy the tenure committee was to see to it that he was not in any kind of situation for the year he had when he knew that he was not going to be tenured. No women graduate students were assigned to him and no small seminar groups. All he could do was teach big lecture sections. They were uncomfortable situations. Both of them said they didn\\'t know what they were doing but in hindsight they had some inkling. Both of them happened to be married. I think one had no children, the other had one son. This is awful: They were both married to really unattractive women. They were women in the same discipline, and this was before the day when you hired somebody, the trailing spouse is coming through, you\\'ve got to find a tenured position for her too. But I thought if you\\'re both in the same discipline and you\\'re both alike politically, philosophically, what do you talk about at night and what are your lives like? I realize now I was just looking for ways of rationalizing their behavior, but you really couldn\\'t. They knew what they were doing. Both of them, I\\'ll have to admit, got jobs at good universities elsewhere, but nobody at those hiring universities ever called to ask me why the person was leaving either, so we just didn\\'t go there.',\n",
       " 'Absolutely. I learned from a friend after my deanship that all the women administrators at the university were called \"suits\" because we all wore suits, period, and the men would come in in slacks and shirtsleeves but the women administrators did not. You reminded me also that last summer I had varicose veins repaired and when the physician first came in to look at the sonographs, or whatever they were looking at, he said, \"I\\'ll bet you were a teacher,\" and I said, \"Yeah, this is forty years of standing on your feet in high heeled shoes,\" and he said, \"It\\'s a story I hear [1:12:19 every day.]\" Now, of course, I mean Suzanne doesn\\'t wear high heels to class, but you just did. In the classes you went into, you were put together. I don\\'t think I ever wore slacks to class until, I don\\'t know, probably the \\'80s, sometime in there. You wore dresses, you wore stockings and high heeled shoes, and what a fool we were to do those kinds of things. [Laughs] JF: But I think there\\'s\".

You look at male newscasters, they\\'re all up there with suits and ties and looking all put together and you see women newscasters and they\\'re in all kinds of revealing clothes, skirts up to here, and I don\\'t get it. I don\\'t know what this means or how one is supposed to think of these women. There was a situation on the news not too long ago; I think it was in Boston, up east someplace. A woman was raped and somehow managed to survive. It was intended to be a homicide. One of the newscasters, like an idiot, asked the sheriff, how can women protect themselves from this kind of random violence, and he said stop dressing like sluts. And of course the national media, CNN, went bananas; here we go, blaming the victim again. He apologized and retracted his statement, but there was a kernel of truth there which he should have figured out a better way to talk about. There is an element of you\\'ve got to stop dressing provocatively if you\\'re going into a bar in a seedy side of town. I\\'m very conscious of the fact that my granddaughter, she wants to be a princess. She idolizes these popular singers, these women who could just as well be standing up there stark naked as far as I\\'m concerned. So I have mixed feelings about it, and yes we did always look put together when we went to class, but I\\'m not entirely comfortable with women\\'s fashions right now. I\\'ll put it that way. Of course I\\'m sure my granddaughter will win when it comes to any argument. [Laughs] But I would have to admit that I guess I grew up in a pretty conservative household because I\\'m beginning to remember my father wouldn\\'t let me wear those short skirts that we used to wear to the roller rink and roller skating was a really big deal when I was growing up and I just thought that was terrible. I just wouldn\\'t go if I couldn\\'t dress like everybody else. Then of course you become aware of how much young people want to be just like everybody else. They don\\'t want to be different. But I\\'m uneasy about modern fashion, I will say that, and I\\'m not blaming the victim; I\\'m just saying be smart. On the other hand, being smart means knowing how to take care of your self I think, and I won\\'t go any further.',\n",

       " 'Okay, we were talking about when I moved to Forsyth County and discovered that this was a county with no African Americans, no blacks, in the whole county and that some ten or fifteen years before had had this real race riot kind of--not a race riot. They had accused this black of raping a woman, or something, one of those episodes, and they ran every black out of the county, took over their farms and whatever and they had to move. I was told stories about how they hung blacks around the courthouse. I know they at least lynched the guy that they were accusing of this, and I don\\'t know how many others. Some people maybe have done some research on it, but the stories were told. I could just see bodies hanging all around the courthouse in my mind as to what happened. So it was kind of a really [pause] horror. And then blacks coming in through the town on trucks to deliver stuff to the stores were afraid to get out of the truck. They would hide in the back of the truck. I found this to be just horrifying, but somehow I never quite got it connected with doing anything about it or thinking about it in that way. My father came home from the mail route one day, and he said he saw this old black man bicycling through town and he was on his way to Gainesville. And he said, \"I\\'m worried he\\'s got to go through Chestatee because that\\'s where the--.\" The young Chestatee boys were the ones that started the riot. They threw all the blacks out, the rowdy boys of Chestatee.

The harassment we all talked about and we all knew about it and it did happen. I was lucky I was never harassed seriously. But if you were, we were traveling on the job and people drank too much so things happened. But my saying no always worked. So that was good. I didn't have any awful experiences.

I saw a sea change in attitude because their girls were facing what a lot of the rest of us had faced. I think it became clear that the path was not get a college degree, get married, and have babies. So I think there became a change that started in the late [19]70s and continued. I'm proud of what we did. I am very disgusted, angry, frustrated over what I see is part of a religious-seeming religious, I guess, I don't know where it's all coming from-of trying to put the genie back in the bottle, trying to put women back into--. And they're using Roe v. Wade and birth control and all. I don't know if it's a generational situation where people are fearful, but I feel like some of the things that we accomplished, we're losing. I mean, to pass a bill that requires the IRS to look into the tax situation of women who have been raped, there's something sick going on. When Congress is spending all this time and our state legislature all this time on all of these non-issues, it's like the war on women. That's what some people are calling it, and I think that's very accurate. I think the war on teachers is almost a war on women. You espouse education as important and, yet, you're trying to take rights away from teachers. I don't get it. So I'm very angry about that because I think we're trying to step back to a time--. And people keep talking about, oh, how it was in the [19]50s. Well, bullshit. (laughs) The '50s were not the be [all] and [end] all. I think women were stuck in family situations.

       " \"MORROW: Medicaid, being federally funded, had to comply with any federal rules. And my recollection is that the federal funding for the abortion issue was in cases of rape or threatened life of the mother. One of my concerns here in North Carolina was not only rape and risk of life of the mother, but incest. I felt that as long as it was legally right for the wealthy women to have abortions, that it should be legally right for poor women to have abortions. Poor women who could afford another mouth to feed even less than the rich, and so I persuaded the legislature to appropriate some state funds for abortions so that--. For example, thirteen, fourteen-year-old girls who got pregnant, and sometimes it was incest in the family, and they had no business first of all in getting pregnant, but they didn't have control over it because its usually the male in the family who has control there. And secondly, they should not be forced to have a baby at that young age. So I thought we needed to have some state funds to abort these youngsters. And so the legislature, even though many of them were very opposed to abortion, they still felt that, you know--. They felt, I think, the same as I did, that to force a teenager to have a pregnancy and carry it through and have a baby that she was not able to take care of was not an appropriate thing to have happen. So our legislature, as I recall, appropriated two-hundred-thousand dollars in state funds for abortions for poor women, which would cover, of course, incest, rape, and risk of life of the mother, just as the federal government did, but it might cover some other situations where the pregnancy existed and was not needed nor wanted. It's a shame that we can't prevent unwanted pregnancies altogether, but the sex drive apparently is such a strong one for procreation that it alters behavior, especially if alcohol or any other kinds of drugs are involved. So I think it's much more desirable to prevent unwanted pregnancies than it is to have to deal with them after pregnancy has occurred.\",\n",

So we are standing in solidarity with our Israeli sisters in Jerusalem. So I feel--.

I was molested in the back of a church as a child by a person who then came out and spoke in tongues, and there was a message delivered. So you can imagine the stories that I told to myself, and this happened for a long time as a child when I would come here for summers. And yet something deep always wooed me to be healed. Whether it was walking by the rivers or just quiet. I say I am as comfortable in a Holy Ghost-filled church service as I am a camp meeting, as I am an ashram as I am with my Jewish friends at synagogue, as I am on my patio because it\\'s not about the process or the path to that place. It\\'s about the place itself. And so that\\'s what I find is so interesting about me then coming back here and helping build these bridges between in these different places. Because as I was going through my own healing process I can remember what it was like for me to break away from what I had been taught traditionally and how it was so deeply disturbing that many times I called out, \"Please help me to understand.\" Because some of the things I now believe I was taught back then were evil. And yet there was something deep inside me that was stirring me, and it didn\\'t feel bad; it felt good, and so I would cry out and again the chills of, \"Help me understand.\" The words of \"I am the same God\" keep coming to me all the time. They get dropped in my spirit. \"I am the same God. I am the same God.\" So I live and operate from that place and offer that to those who are open to hear it because there are some we know will never be swayed. There are some who are looking for help out of that thing because they\\'re having questions too.

I don\\'t know, but I try to stay in that space and have enough courage to speak my piece, but most truth and most love is really important to me versus taking a bat and trying to shatter people\\'s belief systems.

That is the path. That is the journey. That is the role, to continue to move beyond that in ways not just numbly, blindly saying it's okay. But finding deep forgiveness.

There was a woman named Francis Woods, a great feminist in Fayetteville, had gone--I can\\'t remember where she went to school now, somewhere in the Northeast; I think maybe Rutgers, but I\\'m not sure, but she had studied there. This was 1976. In getting her degree, she had studied domestic violence. It was being brought up then in an academic and a public way, mainly out of England. And so she came back and she pulled a bunch of us together and she said, \"There\\'s this thing that\\'s happening around that country and it\\'s been happening forever. It\\'s that women are getting raped and beaten within their own marriages. We were like basically, \"Are you sure?\" I mean, it really was such a&#8230; JD: &#8230;It was an unspeakable crime. SP: Yeah, and we had gotten rape and understood rape, but gotten the idea of that and had a lot of politics around that, but this was so hidden and so unspeakable. So we started organizing together and the group of us developed this battered women\\'s shelter, and there were three women who were academics at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville who took out the loan to buy us a house. We ran it off volunteer workers and CETA, and I became the chair of the board as an out lesbian.',\n",
       " \"So, as we worked with monitoring the--I'm a little bit jumping about here, but I do have a train of thought, monitoring the right, the far right, we came increasingly to recognize that that wasn't what people were most concerned with. We found that what people were most concerned with was the everyday acts of racial and gender injustice and homophobic violence and religious violence. So, we created this thing called the Women's Watchcare Network, which was funded by the United Methodist Women out of New York, which was a nice thing. So we were going to monitor all of the sexist violence and that, of course, was impossible. We couldn't monitor all the violence against women, so we ended up monitoring just the deaths of women--hundreds. So we would document them, and we monitored extreme acts of racial violence and homophobic violence and religious violence and we held meetings around the state, where we would put people who had experienced religious violence and sexist violence and homophobic violence in the same room and talk to each other. What people discovered is their experience was very, very similar. They could, out of that, bring analysis, understand the connection of that violence--racist, sexist, homophobic and religious. What was probably the most transforming for us was the sexist violence.\",\n",

We took on lots of issues that were really tough issues, like when a group of black basketball players raped a white drunk girl in Fayetteville and they were the stars. The basketball team was going to keep them from being able to go to the tournament. We were slammed, both by the black community and by the feminist community because we took a position on both, that it was wrong and also a position about what it meant to be in the state and have your--to be black and basically to be honored academically only for your bodies to be brought into the university, so we rubbed both ways. We were so viciously attacked by the press. I mean, it was enormous, the copies of the articles that were written in relation to us, and the threats that we got on that.',\n",

SR: Absolutely. It all came about at the same time. While we were marching to have the right to vote, women in the Northeast were also marching against the Vietnam War, and after they stopped marching, or during the same time that they marched against the Vietnam War, they also started burning bras. And the National Organization of Women became a national movement, a national power, and now it\\'s politically correct for some women to say, \"I\\'m not a feminist,\" \"I don\\'t believe in feminism,\" but feminism is what changed for working women, particularly the white middle-class woman. It changed her life for the better, because she was no longer afraid to step out and speak out against what she felt was discrimination against her. All of this was a result of the civil rights movement in the sixties and the decade of change from the late fifties to the early seventies, that people were wanting a different America. It was an America that did not want to fight the Vietnamese war. It was an America that had women suing because they were sexually harassed on the job, women suing because they were passed over for promotion and less-qualified men got the job. Women suing because they were called the n-word on the job and terminated. Any number of categories: gender--. And one of the worst categories, I think, in my practice of civil rights, was where the employer was not overtly violating the law. He didn\\'t do the overt things, like call you a bitch or use the n-word or just say, \"I\\'m firing you because you didn\\'t sleep with me.\" But what they did, many employers engaged in invidious campaigns of hostile work environment harassment, where day in and day out when the complaining party came to work, there was always something done to harass them, to upset them, to force them into quitting their job.

It was sickening, the amount of sexual harassment that was going on to women who were employed. Women who worked as waitresses, women who worked in restaurants and nightclubs, women who worked in hotels as maids. Women who had jobs that were physicists, that were scientists. It just ran the gamut of sexual harassment in the workplace. When I was in private practice, one of the biggest things that I saw coming, just before I retired, was that there was an awful lot of women being harassed on the job with internet pornography. The internet pornography was exploding. It exploded from Jellico, Tennessee, to Knoxville, Tennessee to wherever you were, it didn't matter how small the town was, how large the town was. On a military base, in a trucking company, in a federal installation. Men were having great issues with feeling that they had the right to look at pornography during work hours in the workplace.

And Hicks was a case in which the employer had made his employee reach in his pants pocket and take money out of his pants pocket to get money to get paid or whatever. Or for whatever it was that he wanted her to do that for, but it was a case that set the standard that you could be found guilty of sexual harassment and damages could be rewarded for psychological damages. Because at one time, the psychological damages were not a part of the remedies for a sexual harassment discrimination lawsuit.

Area Feminist Alliance, we called it DCAFA\"but we were never more than one, two, or three voices at a meeting out of say fifteen, twenty people. But at the same time I really admired the working class consciousness that the white women had. I mean the way we all got jobs at the D.C. Rape Crisis Center was that it was a group of six white women that founded it, out of a hotline basically, but they made a commitment that whenever they got their first grants to pay salaries they were going to hire women from the community, which meant black women, and even though they were working class white women themselves who needed jobs\". I mean they were not wealthy women. One was a carpenter, one was a telephone operator.

How come we\\'ve never heard of Uncle Eli? We know Uncle Jim, we know Uncle Eskie, we know Booker T.; how come we don\\'t know about Uncle Eli? How did we miss this uncle?\" My mother said, \"Oh, he was one of Big Mama\\'s children,\" and that\\'s all she said about Uncle Eli, and nobody went to his funeral or anything. So Uncle Eli was like the big mystery but we weren\\'t curious enough to try to follow it up. Well it turns out Uncle Eli was the uncle that sexually abused all the girls in the family. So Mama never had a healthy relationship around sex and sexuality, and then when I became pregnant through incest, through a cousin, my mother went ballistic. She actually beat me for being pregnant. She was not healthy around sex and sexuality. I could never under\". And she did some really predictable but what seemed to be bizarre things at the time, like every time my father would take one of his daughters out\"and me and my father were particularly close so I hung out with Daddy all the time. I was Daddy\\'s girl. Daddy was the light of my life and I loved him to death. I know I was his favorite child and he knows he was my favorite parent, so there was no ambiguity at all about our relationship, but my mother would get so angry. I knew the minute I came home whatever I did it was not going to be right, and they believed in corporal punishment, so if I didn\\'t wash the dishes good enough that night I was going to get a whipping. It wasn\\'t until years later that I put together her fear around an adult male having a child outside of her eyes. My big sister told me, \"She did the same with me.\" She was just paranoid and it wasn\\'t until she told us her story, after we were already in our thirties [Laughs] that we were able to put all the pieces together, because what seemed to be craziness was actually PTSD. CGD: Were you able to tell your mother about the incest? LR: I had to. CGD: Was she able to hear it and process it? LR: [Pause] I\\'m not sure, because she got terribly re-stimulated by it. She had blamed herself for her own so she blamed me for mine. We actually agreed that I would go to a home for unwed mothers. CGD: How old were you? LR: Fourteen. CGD: Okay. So, I\\'m thinking about Rickie Solinger\\'s book about unwed mothers, of course later time period, and the argument is that basically in the \\'50s there are very few homes for black unwed mothers, so what was your experience? LR: It wasn\\'t a black home but I was the only black girl at the home. It was a home run by the Salvation Army in San Antonio, near Trinity University, over on the other side of town. The Salvation Army ran a number of these homes across America. A little bit more skirt to the story, I had already received a scholarship to Radcliffe and, trust me, having Melvin baby, was not how I planned on becoming a mama. I was not planning on being a mama. He was supposed to be babysitting me and he thought it was a better idea to have sex with me, and he was a serial abuser. That was one of the things that I really challenged within my family, how multigenerational the incest was, and yet we couldn\\'t talk about sex and sexuality, and I challenged that. The minute I became conscious of it I started introducing this very awkward conversation into our family. [Laughs] Whenever I see a young budding niece I go have a conversation with their mama, with my brother, whoever it was needed to have a conversation, and they would dread me coming, because I would say, \"You know what happened to me, you know what happened to Mama; we got to stop this in this generation here, okay? I don\\'t even know how far back it goes but I know it\\'s going to stop in this generation, and I will kill any of you that lay a hand on anybody and I find out about it.\"',\n",
       " 'So I remember when I was offered the job they said we\\'d like you to help NOW recruit women of color, and I said, \"I don\\'t recruit. The Marines recruit. I can find out why women of color don\\'t stay, because it\\'s not like you have problems attracting them but you have problems keeping them.\" So I said, \"I\\'ll serve like an ombudsman, to find out what\\'s going on internally that makes you be your worst enemy, because I see women of color coming to NOW all the time, I just don\\'t see them staying, so recruiting ain\\'t your problem.\" [Laughs] But your larger question, because I worked first in the anti-rape movement and then the anti-sterilization abuse movement, then the prochoice movement, and now in the women\\'s human rights movement, I\\'ve always had to deal with what I call the impact of white supremacy on the feminist movement because the feminist movement likes to think that because they work against gender oppression that they work against racial oppression automatically, and that\\'s not a given. They are intensely uncomfortable, for the most part, with how black women claim and redefine feminism for ourselves, and we intersect it. From Sojourner Truth\\'s statement, \"Ain\\'t I a Woman?\" we\\'ve had an intersectional approach that they find bewildering and the more strident of them would call diluting. So I\\'ve always been the bridge.',\n",
       " \"No, no. I don't think we were an unusual generation. I think we just fell into the chain of leadership that our ancestors set out for us. I was lucky enough in my twenties to be appointed to the D.C. Commission for Women by Marion Barry when I was at the Rape Crisis Center, and there were blue-haired black women who knew Mary Church Terrell and Mary McLeod Bethune who took me under their wings and showed me a lot about women's power and feminist consciousness through a black lens.\",\n",
       " \"What can I say? So I was already deeply questioning the church, and then when I got pregnant and had to stand up and publicly profess that I was a sinner though I'd been incested, I was through with that deal then. CGD: And did you go back after that? LR: I have not been to a church for service since then. I've been there for weddings, I've given speeches from the pulpit, I've been there for lots of funerals, but I've not been there as a worshiper since I was fifteen years old with a baby and I was accused of being the sinner when a twenty-seven-year-old had incested me. Oh, no, no, no, no. This deal I don't like. And then you tell me my baby's born in sin. My baby is a baby. [Laughs] He ain't done nothing. So the whole deal did not make sense to me.\",\n",
       " 'You know, I keep it\". Well even before I started talking about abortion and incest I was talking about sterilization abuse, which is acceptable, but I started talking about rape, which was not, in the black community. CGD: Why do you think that was not acceptable? LR: Because ninety-five percent of rapes are intra-racial. If I wanted to talk about rape as something white men did to black women I could have had the Ida B. Wells story, but talking about rape as something that black men do to black women, it\\'s airing dirty laundry. So long before I started publicly talking about abortion I was committing the social faux pas of talking about rape and incest in the black community as something black people did to ourselves. I mean I\\'ve gotten booed off black stages and stuff, I mean stages at black conferences and conventions. They always used to accuse us of selling out to the white women, and one guy called me\"he and his wife, [1:41:36], I\\'ll never forget them\"they accused me of being a representative of COINTELPRO because I was talking about this stuff and it wasn\\'t helping the black community, and so I had to be a plant by the FBI to destabilize the black movement. [Sighs; laughs] That was a pretty heavy charge, to accuse somebody of being COINTELPRO back in that day, because that set you up for somebody just taking you out of here, only because I was talking about gender oppression and they didn\\'t want to talk about it.',\n",

There are a few ladies who never wore anything but suits, and some are a little bit more casual. I won t tell you her name, but there was a representative who was elected, and she came up there and would wear a blazer, but she would wear these horribly, horribly derogatory t-shirts. They were derogatory against men. They were horrible, and she would come over to us and give us these cartoons that she had copied off 18 Finchum Coleman somewhere. They were horrible, and she would give those to us and say, These are just for us girls. And I m just thinking, Oh my gosh, and I m so dumb I never shared it with any of the guys. After the first year or the first legislative session, she learned because after that she started dressing very professionally. There are a few other people that noticed that, but it was very, very inappropriate. She finally started dressing very professionally and I realized, I need some suits. I ve been told the chamber is always cold. Oh, it s freezing and I would gripe like crazy about those fans and everything, trying to get them to turn the fans down, turn the heat up. In fact, I can even remember I don t know why I keep remembering Kevin Cox, but he went out to his car one time and got a blanket. It was horribly cold, and I guess it s to keep you awake some of the time. One thing I would like to say, just for posterity I guess it was difficult being a woman. It s difficult being a republican woman in the minority. One thing people need to understand is there were some guys out there that were horrible male chauvinists. I knew not to ever get near them and there was one guy I should have filed a sexual harassment suit against once because of his off-color teasing. I knew who I could tease with and who I couldn t, you know. I knew who I could come up and pat on the back and who I couldn t. But women are no different. I m not going to say names, but there was one legislator, she was young and to get what she wanted, she would go to the back of the chamber and hop up on the desk. She wore these real cute little short skirts and she knew what she was doing. She used her sexuality, you know. The men go about it a different way, but the women use their sexuality. I saw this particular representative several times embraced with men. I called it bear hugged, and she knew what she was doing. I thought, You don t need to do that. Then this other representative, she would file all these bills and we d kill them. Then she d come over to the guys and start rubbing her hands all over their backs and saying, If you d just let me bring the bill up for reconsideration if you ll just vote if you ll just give in to my let me bring it back up, and I ll take it back to committee, and she d just rub all over them, and of course they did it. She never did come up with decent bills, I didn t think. I d sit there and watch this going on, and I d go over and I d say, You are so pathetic you are so pathetic that you let her come over here and do this. She managed to get her stuff through. Most of the other women I don t think really did that. There s always a little bit of that feminine thing because we re women and we deal with things differently, but I remember those two. 19 Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman Finchum Coleman And then there are always rumors but it was difficult being a woman out there because you weren t in the in-group. Like I said at the beginning, I had to go and search out information because they weren t going to give it to me voluntarily. I think that s probably true of most of the women. We had to really fight. But for all those guys that were just horrible, there were some really good guys. I just thought the world of them and they understood that we were all equal out there.

And some of the gentlemen that were very involved from Norman came up and asked me if I would run. I really wasn t too eager to do that, either, but there was a reason I needed to do that. Now that was kind of a gender based issue. We had a little sexual harassment going on down there with our county commissioner and a lot of people really felt that a woman would be the answer. So when I found about twenty women asked me to run county employees I did choose to run and I did win. I was very surprised again. That was a hot and heavy race too.

We re gonna let her talk about her bill before we kill it. Yeah and of course they did, so there were those kinds of experiences. One of the lessons that I learned from my husband was that I was not so much interested in whether my name was on the bill, but on what happened, and so there were a lot of pieces of legislation that I handled on the floor or I did the roll calls on because I cared about the topic. I worked on th\\n bill that allowed for prosecution of spousal rape. People do things to each other that frankly I had never heard of or thought about before I went to the legislature.

We know that people tend to stay with things that they re familiar and comfortable with, and so there were men there who thumped the Bible and who said that they had a biblical entitlement. I ll never forget a senator on the spousal rape bill saying that if he didn t rape his wife, he d probably never have sex. We were doing a child support bill and a guy in the Senate was saying, Does this mean that, you know, if you have a one-night stand you re responsible for the child? I just can t imagine that, and I thought, You can t be that ignorant. But a lot of it was based on what I clearly believe is misinterpretation of the Bible and ignorance.

We desperately need both parties to be working together on things that matter and not trying to shoot each other down all the time. That s terrible for the people, terrible for the country. I passed that. Let s see I passed a bill saying that you couldn t put rape victims private information on the Internet, which I thought was very important. I passed another pro-life bill, and both of these bills required informed consent before abortion. They required parental consent for minors. The first bill said that if you murder a pregnant woman you can be charged with the death of the baby as well as the death of the woman. Then the second bill basically dealt with funding and some of those issues. I passed that.

And so one of the programs that took me two sessions to complete was the graduated driver s license for teenagers. He had worked on that for a couple of years so I worked on that pretty hard and we got that done. The other one is a trucking bill that he had and this is one I had a hard time following. (Laughs) So I at least got some other senators involved in it and we were able to get that done. It was to help get kind of a one-stop shop for truckers to get licenses and other things in one agency instead of spread out over two or three, which was just costly and time consuming. So they did get that done. Another group did that. A couple that I haven t finished yet, is on driver s license programs in public schools. We had them for years and now we ve quit having them, then they started coming back and then they re gone again. And that s because of the money and the driver s license education fund. I m going to try to work on that again this year because it s a reimbursement program. If schools don t get reimbursed sufficiently, they re not going to carry the program, pure and simple. So I m going to look at that. Another one that I ve started that Keith did work on some was trying to create a aging department to consolidate all of senior s services because right now they re spread out over six or seven agencies. That just doesn t make any sense to me. This is something very high on senior groups lists your area-wide aging, your silver-haired legislature and other senior groups, AARP, this is pretty high on their list. And so I ve had that bill up there for a couple of years and I m still working on it. I think we re going to see a little movement on it this year, I really do. We ve got some additional groups involved and interested and some more legislators interested in it too. Another one is domestic violence. I ve got a real passion for domestic violence as far as trying to do something about it in Oklahoma. It just gets me that it s still a misdemeanor for a first-time offense. And if anyone knows anything about domestic violence, you know it s happened more than once before it ever gets to court, before there are 20 Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich Finchum Leftwich ever charges filed. It is a violent crime, first and foremost and yet we are not making that first-offense a felony. But yet we re filling up our prisons with all these non-violent offenders. I have a real problem with that. One of the scenarios I use is in Oklahom\\n it s a felony to own a fighting rooster or fight dogs but it s a misdemeanor to hit your wife. I am hoping in the time I m here, that Oklahoma is going to stand up and say, Enough is enough. That We re not having any tolerance for domestic violence. And help me push that through the legislature and get that done. In addition to that, it s important to also give some economic security to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. That s another bill that I ve been working on.',\n",
       " 'Well, I guess the first very emotional, controversial hard decision that I voted on was the House Bill 1750. That was the education bill, where they increased taxes to fund education, a very, very controversial bill and just barely passed. And Governor Bellmon was in. I was so pro-education and I wanted to do whatever it took to get the best possible education for our children in the state and I knew that we had to do something. But you had to think at the time that if you voted for a tax increase then you probably wouldn t be back. That was the decision that I had to make. I felt like whether I came back or not, it was the right decision, and that was the most controversial bill. What is very passionate to me and very important to me was partial birth abortion, to stop that. I was the author and it passed. In Oklahoma, there could not be any partial birth abortions performed. Being a democrat woman was very controversial, received a lot of phone calls and a lot of letters about how disappointed they were that I was a woman, number one, and that I was a democrat. But again that was my heart, it was my passion, and I am pro-life. I m very open to the life and death of the mother and incest and rape but as far as just for birth control, I don t agree with that. That s where I stand. Everyone knew where I stood, and that was another issue that was very controversial at the time.',\n",
