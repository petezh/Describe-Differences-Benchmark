Mr. Chairman,
On behalf of the Government of Japan, I would like to extend my wholehearted congratulations to you on your assumption of the chairmanship of Main Committee II at this important Conference. My delegation is confident that under your very able guidance our discussions in this Committee will be fruitful and will contribute to the success of the Conference.
Mr. Chairman,
Japan recognizes that the NPT is vital to the world peace and security, and we also regard this Treaty as a cornerstone for creation of a nuclear-weapon-free world. Therefore, we are very encouraged by the fact that as many as nine new countries have joined the Treaty since the last Conference in 1995. The States parties should further urge those states still remaining outside this Treaty that is approaching to be a nearly universal one, to accede to it at the earliest date as called for in "the Decision on Principles and Objectives" in 1995. The States parties should also ensure the irreversibility of non-proliferation by doing their utmost to shore up and flesh out the nuclear non-proliferation regime.
The nuclear testings by the two countries in South Asia, both of which have such great influence and play an important role in the international politics, constituted the most serious challenge to the global nuclear non-proliferation regime during the last five years. In order to reverse the present dangerous situation in South Asia in a more desirable direction, the international community should have continuous dialogues with both countries, sending a clear message that the nuclear proliferation in South Asia is a matter of global concern and calling for steps to be taken by both countries to respect, and help to secure, the nuclear non-proliferation regime. While welcoming such measures already taken by India and Pakistan as moratoria on nuclear testing and strengthening of export control of nuclear material and technologies, Japan has been urging both countries to take further measures. It considers as particularly important their fulfilment of the promise on the signing of the CTBT which was made by the leaders of both countries in UN General Assembly.
The Middle East is a region where only one country is still outside the Treaty, and where we saw some evident risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Resolution on the Middle East adopted in 1995 provides a good basis for further work, and the initiative to establish a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery vehicles, which is stipulated in the Resolution, is an important, viable target. Therefore, it is regrettable that no significant step has been taken on this issue except for the ratification of the Treaty by a few countries in the region. Serious work should be done during the next five years to implement the Resolution. In this connection, Japan is much encouraged by the fact that the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, which has been established by the UN Security Council resolution 1284 to verify the compliance by Iraq with its obligations under the Security Council resolution 687, is now in the process of formulation.
Mr. Chairman.
Turning to Northeast Asia, which, because of its proximity to Japan, is a matter of greatest concern for Japan. The "Agreed Framework" of 1994 between the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was significant; as we see it, it provided a most realistic and effective approach to keep the DPRK harnessed to the non-proliferation regime while diffusing the crisis that was triggered by its announcement to withdraw from the NPT. Japan, therefore, has been supporting the Agreed Framework and actively contributing to the Light Water Reactors (LWR) project through KEDO.
In this context, it must be reminded that under the terms of the Agreed Framework the DPRK remains a party to the NPT and is also committed to allowing implementation of its safeguards agreement under the NPT. It is the consensus repeatedly expressed by the international community, at the meetings of the IAEA or the United Nations, that the safeguards agreement between the DPRK and the IAEA is still in force despite the DPRK's withdrawal from the IAEA and that the DPRK needs to fulfill its obligations under that agreement. The LWR project of KEDO, commenced under the Agreed Framework, has recently entered into the stage of full scale construction. At this critical juncture, I would like to reiterate that the DPRK's full compliance with its safeguards agreement with the IAEA is a major premise for the provision of LWR to the DPRK.
I would also like to encourage the DPRK to faithfully fulfill all the obligations under the NPT, and, in particular, to advance without delay with the IAEA in order to achieve the full-compliance with the safeguards agreement. I am convinced that the full commitment to the international non-proliferation regime will be the first step the DPRK can take if it wishes to contribute to peace and stability in Northeast Asia and to gain confidence among the countries in the region.
Mr. Chairman,
The IAEA's safeguards system is essential for the maintenance of the non-proliferation regime as a mechanism to prevent non-compliance with the Treaty. It is vital to ensure the universal acceptance of this system and to make it as effective as possible. Japan highly appreciates the current efforts of IAEA in strengthening and improving efficiency of safeguards, in order to fulfil its obligations referred to in "the Decision on Principles and Objectives" at the last Review Conference. I would like to emphasize that the importance of the Model Additional Protocol (INFCIRC/540, corrected) in fulfilment of the IAEA's mission provided in Article III of the Treaty, especially because the IAEA's competence to implement safeguards at the level necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty now derives not only from the existing safeguards agreements in place, but also from Additional Protocols. They should now be regarded as an essential part of the IAEA's safeguards system. Japan is one of the first countries whose Additional Protocols with the IAEA have entered into force. We regret to observe that still only 9 such Protocols have entered into force. Japan, therefore, strongly urges that all States that have not yet concluded the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement under the Treaty to do so in an expeditious manner, and those which already have such agreements in place to conclude and bring into force their respective Additional Protocols with the IAEA without delay. I would also like to take this opportunity to re-iterate that we believe we should have some sort of an international action plan for the purpose of achieving an early universal conclusion of the Protocols, and urge the IAEA and its member States to take concrete steps toward this end. In considering such an action plan countries may consider convening of an international conference at an appropriate occasion. Japan is ready to work together with the IAEA and fellow Member countries in this regard.
Mr. Chairman,
An effective nuclear-weapon-free zone with agreement of all the states concerned in the region and the nuclear weapon states is also a meaningful measure to ensure the irreversibility of the non-proliferation regime. It is, therefore, encouraging that two regions, namely Africa and Southeast Asia, have reached respective agreements for such zones since 1995. Japan hopes that the Pelindaba Treaty will come into force at an early date and agreement will be reached on the protocol of the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone between the states in the region and the nuclear weapon states. Further, five Central Asian countries are now engaged, on the basis of the agreement reached at their highest level, in negotiations on a treaty to establish their nuclear-weapon-free zone. Japan vigorously supports their political will and has been making concrete contributions to their negotiating efforts by inviting them to meet in Japan to hold negotiations.
Mr. Chairman,
While we should actively promote the cooperation with regard to the peaceful use of nuclear technology, that must be coupled with additional care in preventing the use of such technology for the development and production of nuclear weapons. It is the firm position of my Government that it must strictly control export licenses for these goods and technology, issuing them only when the recipient country adheres to and act in accordance with the NPT, or an equivalent treaty, and has in force a comprehensive safeguards agreement with IAEA. We would like other countries concerned to take similarly strict steps.
Japan also recognizes and supports the mechanisms of the Zangger Committee and the Nuclear Suppliers Group as multilateral endeavors in this field. Both of them deal with nuclear material, equipment and technology, the latter dealing also with nuclear-related dual-use material, equipment, software and related technology. In our view these steps form an important element to fulfill NPT Adherent's obligations among other things under its Article I "not in any way to assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear weapon State to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons." We also appreciate the recent efforts by NSG to increase transparency in its activities, in response to the decision taken by the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference.
Mr. Chairman,
I look forward to having the opportunity to express the views of my delegation on various questions during the course of our discussion. Let me conclude my remarks today with the assurance of our full cooperation with you, Mr. Chairman, as you discharge your important duties.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
