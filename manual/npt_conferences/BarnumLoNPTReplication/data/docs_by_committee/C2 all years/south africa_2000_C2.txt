Mr. Chairperson, 
May I congratulate you and your two Vice Chairs on the assumption of your important positions. Please be assured of my delegation's cooperation and support. 
Mr. Chairperson, 
I would like to begin by recalling our agreement at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference where, in paragraph II of Principles and Objectives, we confirmed that: 
"International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards should be regularly assessed and evaluated. Decisions adopted by its Board of Governors aimed at further strengthening the effectiveness of Agency safeguards should be supported and implemented and the Agency's capability to detect undeclared nuclear activities should be increased. Also, States not party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons should be urged to enter into comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency." 
This agreement gave recognition to the "strategic partnership" that exists between the IAEA, as the trustee of the safeguards system, on the one hand, and the international community on the other. It as a "strategic partnership" because international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to move towards nuclear disarmament are shared responsibilities that can not be accomplished by any single organization or State on its own. It is also because of this strategic relationship that South Africa places a particular importance on the work which will be done in this Main Committee of the NPT Review Conference. It is work that will not only look back over a period of 5 years to evaluate the successes and failures that marked this partnership, but which will also determine our vision and goals for the future. 
Mr. Chairperson, 
When we last met here in 1995 at the Review and Extension Conference, we voiced concern regarding the weaknesses in some areas of the then existing non-proliferation regime and joined in the call for a revision of the safeguards system. To address these needs, the IAEA took on the mammoth task of improving and strengthening the safeguards system by introducing the Model Protocol Additional to the Safeguards Agreement. In this connection, my delegation would wish to congratulate the Agency for its efforts in introducing a system that will enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards regime. 
South Africa firmly believes that the strengthened safeguards system is a vital mechanism in the achievement of the ultimate goals of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. The three elements it contains, namely increased access to information about a State's nuclear activities, broader access to sites and locations within a State and lastly, the maximum use of new and available technologies to increase detection and ultimately reduce the frequency of on-site inspection will provide added security, assurance and transparency. 
My delegation is also pleased by the announcement of the Director-General of the IAEA, Or Mohammed ElBaradei, that the IAEA Secretariat has already started to implement some of the new strengthening measures, and that the integration process will be progressively introduced this year. This will require the IAEA to establish a new Integrated Safeguards System that combines the highly quantitative perspectives of classical safeguards and the new measures which are more qualitative in nature. This should, however, not result in an add-on system, but in an optimized new system that is flexible but effective and above all, costefficient. This is a major challenge which will, no doubt, require a change in culture both within the Agency and amongst its Members. As strategic partners of the IAEA, it is the duty of the international community to give its full cooperation and assistance to the Agency in this regard. Only through universal adherence to the Additional Protocol and through complete transparency could the full potential of the strengthened safeguards system be achieved. 
South Africa has concluded its negotiations with the IAEA on the text of the Additional Protocol and has initiated the necessary Parliamentary preparations for the conclusion, in due course, of the agreement. 
Mr. Chairperson, 
When the Agency presented its plans for a strengthened safeguards system, it did so with the expectation that implementation of the new system would, in the short term, require more resources, but that cost neutrality would eventually be restored. It is becoming more evident that this ideal will not be achieved. New measures such as remote monitoring are no longer expected to result in dramatic savings in comparison to hands-on verification by Agency Inspectors. South Africa has an understanding for this dilemma, and also for the importance of the IAEA's safeguards function in terms of the Treaty. States Parties are therefore encouraged to be realistic in the continued pressure being placed on the IAEA to reduce costs, and they are reminded of paragraphs 9 and 19 of the Principles and Objectives Document. Not only is the work load of the IAEA increasing, but new roles, such as the verification of ex-weapons material in terms of the Trilateral Initiative, also have a major impact on resource requirements. 
It should go without saying that as the safeguards and verification process expands to more facilities and countries, the cost of safeguards will increase. It is the duty of the international community in this partnership, to ensure that the issue surrounding the budgetary problem be solved in a mature way. My delegation would, once again, caution Member States not to confine the budget of the Agency to a Zero Nominal Growth or even a Zero Real Growth rate. It is my country's view that we cannot expect the Agency to meet new and serious challenges with such impediments. We therefore call on the countries concerned to live up to their obligations and ensure that the Agency is adequately resources, particularly when it comes to safeguards and verification. We believe that if this situation of financial constraint continues, the Agency will be left to run an unacceptable gauntlet: the reduction of costs on the one hand, and the demand for accepting wider responsibilities on the other. Extra-budgetary funding does also not provide a solution to this situation. The long-term reliability of such funding is questionable, such funding is linked to the interests of its donors, and it raises questions regarding the maintenance of the integrity and the impartiality of the Agency. 
Mr. Chairperson, 
South Africa congratulates those countries that have concluded their Additional Protocol agreements with the IAEA. We would also again urge all States that have not yet concluded the original Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA to do so at the earliest opportunity. A united and cooperative effort of support and encouragement to these countries will be required. 
Mr Chairperson, 
Although several setbacks have occurred in several areas of disarmament and non-proliferation during the past five years, my delegation is nevertheless encouraged by the additional positive developments in the area of safeguards that have taken place. One of these relates to the progress achieved in the "Trilateral Initiative,' between the IAEA, the Russian Federation and the United States on the question of nuclear material from decommissioned weapons and stockpiles. This is an important development and we welcome the progress achieved. 
Closely associated with the Agency's safeguards and verification activities is the physical protection of nuclear material, and in this regard, the Agency's initiative in establishing an Illicit Trafficking Database is to be welcomed and is another useful tool strengthening safeguards measures. 
Mr. Chairperson, 
Despite advances in the quest for global peace and security we still face serious challenges. A genuine partnership between the IAEA and the international community will be crucial in the furtherance of non-proliferation as a critical means along the road towards a world free of all nuclear weapons. 
Finally, Mr. Chairperson, I wish to state that South Africa intends submitting a Working Paper for Main Committee II's consideration. This Working Paper provides South Africa's views on, and draft language for, the forward looking elements of our work. The draft language that is provided is based on, and attempts to improve on, the existing language that is included on the safeguards issue in the Principles and Objectives. It would be appreciated if the Secretariat could circulate the Working Paper as an official document of this Main Committee. 
Mr. Chairperson, I thank you.
