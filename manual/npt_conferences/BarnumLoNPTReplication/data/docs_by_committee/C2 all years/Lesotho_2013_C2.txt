CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY

Mr. Chairman,

I align myself with the statement delivered by Indonesia on behalf of the Non-

Aligned Movement (NAM), under this Cluster.
Mr. Chairman,
We came together as UN Member States more than 6 decades ago in pursuit of a
goal of achieving a peaceful world. This noble ideal continues t o elude us due to
the many threats to peace that exist in-the world today. Nuclear weapons are
amongst such threats. With the continuation of the proliferation, both vertical
and horizontal, of these weapons, the future of humanity is a t greater risk. It is in
this context that we underscore the NPT as a landmark instrument that not only
addresses the proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but also contributes t o the world
peace.
The NPT places legal responsibilities and obligations on the Nuclear Weapons
States (NWS) as well as the Non Nuclear Weapon States (NNWS). The
responsibilities and obligations not to transfer nuclear weapons and not to
receive the said weapons, respectively imposed on the NWS and NNWS by
Articles I and II of Treaty, must be adhered to at all times and without any
preconditions. Our fidelity t o the Treaty and i t s principles is the only path towards
the goal of disarmament and non-proliferation.

Mr. Chairman,
It is common cause that the right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy is a corner
stone of the NPT as entrenched under Article IV of the Treaty. That right too
comes with responsibilities and obligations, namely; the responsibility to use

'

nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes, and the obligation to accept the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) comprehensive safeguards for
verification purposes. Honesty and transparency are the sine qua non for
successful implementation of the Treaty. In the enjoyment of the right to peaceful
uses of nuclear energy, States Parties must be very transparent and accordingly
submit to the comprehensive safeguards of the IAEA.
The IAEA verification mechanism promotes transparency and is a confidence
building measure. They are intended t o ensure that the use of nuclear energy
neither leads to the proliferation of nuclear weapons nor endangers the
environment or human health. We support the strengthening of this mechanism,
and indeed the overall strengthening of the Agency. In the same vein, we
advocate for ratification of the relevant IAEA Additional Protocols and Safeguard
Agreements by all States Parties. As a State Party to the NPT, Lesotho has signed
safeguards agreements with the IAEA, including the Small Quantity Protocol
(SQP).
Mr. Chairman,

Nuclear Weapon Free Zones (NWFZs) are of utmost importance for purposes of
,

0

furthering the objectives of the NPT. Progress in this area has been modest. No
NWFZs have been established since the last Review Conference. The conference
on the Middle East Zone Free on Nuclear Weapons did not take place in 2012. We
reiterate the call by the 2010 NPT Review Conference for the establishment of
NWFs and the ratifications by the NWS of the Protocols to existing NWFZs
Treaties. In this regard, we commend the latest ratification in 2011 of Protocols I
f

and II of the Treaty of Pelindaba by Russia, as a NWS. We also commend the

United States for the steps that it has taken leading to the ratification of the
Protocols to the Treaties of Pelindaba and Rarotonga, and we hope that it would
soon become clear as to when the ratifications might take place.

l THANK YOU
