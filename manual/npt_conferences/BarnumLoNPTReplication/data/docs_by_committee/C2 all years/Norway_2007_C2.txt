Mr. Chair,
Norway will also submit a working paper for Cluster 11. My delegation w ,|s therefore limit itself to some key observations.
A strong and credible non-proliferation regime is essential in achieving out mi v>f a world free of nuclear weapons.
In this light we must address outstanding proliferation challenges posed b> iht Marmc Republic of Iran and the DPRK with a view to solve these two matters througn negotiations.
It is imperative that the Review Conference addresses weaknesses in the pre-ent non-proliferation regime. An important step would be to make the IAEA Add'tionuil Pioioeol universal and be viewed as a condition for taking part in peaceful nuclear c< — •peraiion.
It is vital to give the IAEA the necessary political and financial support u witr\ out its vital safeguards task.
Norway is particularly pleased with IAEA activities to assist countries u inch aie converting on a voluntary basis their civilian nuclear research reactors from iMng highh enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU.
We reiterate that important initiatives such as the G8 Global Partnership nd ihe Proliferation Security Initiative (PS1) sustain the NPT non-proliferation rue m
All States Parties have a responsibility to put in place and enforce adequate non-proliferation legislation. Exports control will indeed facilitate peaceful nucieai cooperation. Norway is fully committed to the implementation of Security Council Resolutions 1540 and 1673. We consider these resolutions key instruments :r our joint effort to fight nuclear terrorism.
Finally, as previously stated, Norway considers nuclear weapons free /one ^ an important contribution to non-proliferation.
