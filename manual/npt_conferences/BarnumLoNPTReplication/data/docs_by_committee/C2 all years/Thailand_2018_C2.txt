Statement by the Delegation of Thailand
by Ms. Morakot Sriswasdi, Deputy Director-General, Department
of International Organizations, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Cluster 2: Non-Proliferation
for the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee
for the 2020 NPT Review Conference,
23 April-4 May 2018, Geneva
***************************************************

Mr. Chair,
1.
Thailand aligns itself with the statement delivered by the distinguished
delegate of Indonesia on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.
Mr. Chair,
2.
As we all know, nuclear technology has its genesis in warfare and
the horrific destructive capability that it can bring about. Despite the various
potentials and benefits from the peaceful application of nuclear technology,
this stigma of fear and destruction continues to accompany nuclear technology to
this day. Nuclear non~proliferation is thus key for generating confidence and
trust in the usage of nuclear energy and technology. Coupled with disarmament,
as well as the implementation of the 3Ss - nuclear security, nuclear safety, and
nuclear safeguards - robust non-proliferation measures can help ensure that
nuclear energy and technology are exclusively for peaceful purposes and for
the promotion of sustainable development.

3.
In recent years, Thailand has put forth much effort to meet our
non-proliferation obligations under the NPT and build further upon them.
Our Nuclear Energy for Peace Act, which entered into force in February 2017,
serves as an important legal foundation for the country to make progress and
fulfill our international commitments. The entry into force of the Additional
Protocol to the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement in November 2017 is one
important milestone . We are also getting closer to be party to the Convention on
the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM), with the Cabinet having
already approved of our accession. And just last week, the Cabinet also approved
our accession to the Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS) and the Joint 路
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of
Radioactive Waste Management.
Mr. Chair,
4.
Export control and counter-terrorism related instruments also complement
these nuclear non-proliferation agreements. The UN Security Council Resolution
1540 (2004), the Nuclear Security Contact Group (NSCG), the Global Initiative
to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT), and the Proliferation Security Initiative

-2-

(PSI), all help to reinforce the NPT, fill non-proliferation gaps, and prevent
WMDs from falling into the wrong hands. To correspond with these instruments,
Thailand enacted our Counter-Terrorism and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass
Destruction Financing Act in 2016 and is currently working towards the entry
into force our Trade Control on WMD-related Items Act in 2019. We recognize
that all of these multilateral frameworks strengthen the global non-proliferation
architecture, with the NPT as the centerpiece, and as a result, we must put our
best efforts to adhere to them.
Mr. Chair,
5.
Strengthening non-proliferation also entails meeting the commitments we
made in the past. Thailand supports efforts towards the establishment of
a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other WMDs, as mandated by
a resolution at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference and consequent
outcomes at the 2010 Review Conference. We also encourage further
constructive engagement with Nuclear Weapon-States, working towards
the early signing of the Protocol to the Bangkok Treaty as well as those to other
nuclear weapon-free zone treaties to foster their full and effective
implementation.

6.
On the DPRK, Thailand closely monitors the situation on the Korean
Peninsula and welcomes the recent positive developments on this matter.
Thailand fully supports dialogue and diplomatic means in resolving disarmament
and non-proliferation challenges. We also subscribe to the ASEAN Foreign
Ministers' Statement on the Situation in the Korean Peninsula on 28 April 2018.
7.
The JCPOA is one good example of commitment under non-proliferation
obligations which could be achieved through political and diplomatic efforts.
The implementation of the JCPOA provides assurance to the global community
and contributes to strengthening of non-proliferation architecture. Thailand fully
supports the .JCPOA and the work of the IAEA in this regard and urges all
parties concerned to continue its implementation in good faith.
Mr. Chair,
8.
Thailand also believes that disarmament and non-proliferation are
mutually reinforcing. Progress on disarmament can bear significance . on
non-proliferation efforts. We therefore believe that Treaty on Prohibition on
Nuclear Weapons will contribute to both disarmament and non-proliferation in
paving way towards the world free of nuclear weapons.
9.
In conclusion, Thailand once again reiterates our non-proliferation
commitment and will continue to engage constructively with all parties to build
further upon our NPT obligations. We hope that spirit is shared by other States
Parties and stakeholders for the sake of a successful NPT and for international
peace and security.
