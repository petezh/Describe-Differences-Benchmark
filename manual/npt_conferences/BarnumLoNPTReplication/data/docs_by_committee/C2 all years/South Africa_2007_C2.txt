Chairperson,
My delegation wishes to associate itself with the statement made on behalf of tne Non-Angnec Movement on the issues of safeguards, non-proliferation and nuclear-weapon-free tcnes
At the outset we cannot overemphasize the fact that all of us have COm Pl'^tfcC ourselves to provide to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) the necessary support and assistance to fulfil its safeguards and verification mandate. This commitment derives not ana from our membership of the Agency, but also from the legally-binding agreements a sat we nave concluded.
Chairperson,
It is therefore critical that we should continue to support the Agency to fulfil its safeguards and verification mandate. In this connection, South Africa is concerned that 30 non-nuc sear-weapon States have no Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements (CSAs) in force as requ^ec by Article III of the NPT, and thus no safeguards conclusion is possible.
It is South Africa's view that countries with access to advanced technologies sear a greater responsibility to provide assurances and to build confidence in the peaceful r.iture of their programmes. South Africa therefore believes that such States need to ensure 'hat tne IAEA is able to verify that these capabilities are being used for peaceful purposes only irc.uding through the mechanisms available under the Additional Protocol for strengthened safecuoi :is We 'egard the Additional Protocol as an indispensable instrument to build confidence anc to provide assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities
The absence of indications of the diversion of nuclear material or misuse of >aci»i:>es or other items under safeguards should not let our vigilance diminish and give cause to complacency
Chairperson,
South Africa's own experiences with the illicit network for the transfer of and trr-ae in nuclear material, equipment and technology have clearly shown that States need to p'cvde pro-act:ve and full co-operation to the Agency to fulfil its verification mandate We share tne view tnat the issue of the illicit nuclear network poses one of the most serious challenges to me NPT South Africa notes that between 30 and 40 countries are known to have been affectec by tr,e activities of the illicit network. It is only through the full and active co-operation of ali affected parties, including with the IAEA, that we will be able to successfully curb these ,ii.o«t activities and eliminate the network. In South Africa's view, this co-operation had been uneven anc we have noted that 1 or 2 countries could not continue prosecutions due to insufficient evioence
The illicit network transforms itself as each day passes. If countries could &e-oi>?rate effectively on a higher level, we would be able to significantly reduce the threat posed by the network South Africa remains concerned over the lack of co-operation amongst countries .nvoaed Whilst States moved very fast to co-operate in the fight against terrorism, there has not hee'"> the same sense of urgency to address the threat posed by the illicit network.
Chairperson,
In this context, my delegation should like to reiterate that the IAEA remains the only internationally recognised competent authority responsible for verifying and assuring compliance with the safeguards agreements of States Parties concluded in fulfilment ot their obligations under article III, paragraph 1, of the Treaty, with a view to preventing the diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive aevices Nothing should be done to undermine the authority of the IAEA in this regard. Any concerns regarding non-compliance with safeguards agreements under the Treaty should be directed tc 'he IAEA for consideration of any actions that may be required in accordance with the IAEA's mandate.
Chairperson,
With regard to the issue of nuclear-weapon-free zones, we should recall out ccnT-on c.onvict:or that these zones enhance global and regional peace and security, strengths' 'he rucear non-proliferation regime and contribute towards realising the objectives of nucieai Cbc>?p-.&mem
Countries in Africa are rightfully proud of the Treaty of Pelindaba as an African sucw-ss story vVt would, therefore, invite our fellow African States that have not yet done so to sign ana/or ratify the Pelindaba Treaty as soon as possible in order to ensure its early entry mtc force Given South Africa's belief that nuclear-weapon-free zones play an important role wtmn t^e context o' nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, my delegation welcomes ail endeavours aimed at the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in other regions around the world. We therefore welcome the signing of the Treaty on a nuclear-weapon-free zone :n Centra! Asia in Semipalatinsk on 8 September 2006 by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs or Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
We also commend the initiatives undertaken by the Government of Mexico on Convening the First Conference of the States Parties and Signatories to Treaties that B.stah ish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones, and the recent celebrations of the 40th Anniversary or the Treaty of Tlatelolco. These initiatives provide us with a sound basis to further strengthen co-operation among all the signatories of these nuclear-weapon-free zone Treaties with the aim to realise our common objective of a world free of nuclear weapons.
Thank you, Chairperson.
