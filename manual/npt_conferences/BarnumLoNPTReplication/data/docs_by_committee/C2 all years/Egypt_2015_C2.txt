Mr. Chairman,

At the outset, I wish to congratulate you for chairing over the Subsidiary
Committee of Main Committee II of the 2015 Review Conference. I trust that your wellacknowledged professionalism will contribute to steering the deliberations of the
Committee towards success. I would like to associate Egypt with the statements of the
Non Aligned Movement and the Arab Group.
Mr. Chairman,

The NPT was foreseen as to prevent proliferation, both horizontally and
vertically, bring about the total elimination of nuclear weapons while protecting the
inalienable right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Treaty was devised to
promote, in a balanced manner, its three main pillars. Conditions for the full
realization of Treaty objectives thus heavily depend on the full implementation of all
its obligations, and on its eventual universality.
While nuclear non-proliferation is an essential pillar of the Treaty, its
effectiveness is dependant on achieving parallel progress in the area of nuclear
disarmament, noting the mutually reinforcing nature of both pillars. It is also
dependant on promoting non-proliferation, in both its horizontal and vertical aspects

effectively, in a parallel and balanced manner, consistent with the Treaty obligations
and those undertaken by consensus in the context of Review Conferences.
Mr. Chairman,

This Conference should Review the implementation of Treaty obligations in the
field of nuclear non-proliferation, in all its aspects, taking into account relevant
obligations adopted at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences, and decide on
necessary measures for the full implementation of the Treaty. I would like to propose
the following actions that the Conference should undertake:

a) Reaffirm the mutually reinforcing relationship between nuclear disarmament
and nuclear non-proliferation in all its aspects, confirming that progress on
nuclear non-proliferation remains unsustainable without parallel progress in
nuclear disarmament.
b) Express regret that progress in the prevention of horizontal proliferation has
continued to be undermined by States that are not party to the Treaty, which
operate unsafeguarded nuclear facilities and conduct activities that contradict
fully with the letter, spirit and key norms established by the Treaty.
c) Affirm that much more transparency over nuclear weapons programs in
Nuclear-Weapon States is required in order to verify progress in the field of

vertical proliferation and assess progress, as well as the pace of any such
progress, in the field of nuclear disarmament.
d) Reaffirm the crucial importance of achieving the universality of the Treaty to
address its non-proliferation challenges effectively, both within the Treaty and
outside it. Renew with determination the collective commitment of States
Parties to vigorously pursue the realization of Treaty universality.
e) Reaffirm the importance of strict observance, by individual States Parties as well
as supply regimes, of conditions for supply stipulated in the 1995 "Decision on
Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament", in
particular paragraph 12 on acceptance of the Agency's full-scope safeguards and
internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons or
other nuclear explosive devices being essential requirements for any supply
arrangements for the transfer of source or special fissionable material or
equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use
or production of special fissionable material to non-nuclear-weapon States.
Mr. Chairman,
As regards the establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other
Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East, my delegation would like to highlight the
following:

Among the major unfulfilled commitments undertaken under the Treaty and
review conference - and there are many as was clearly demonstrated during the last
few weeks - the objective of establishing a Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons in the Middle
East has the most dismal record. It epitomizes the failure of the NPT to deliver on legal
obligations.
Twenty years have elapsed since the 1995 Review and Extension Conference
adopted without a vote the Resolution on the Middle East that called for the
establishment of a Nuclear Weapons Free Zone in the region. This Resolution was an
integral part of the package of decisions including the indefinite extension of the NPT.
The establishment of such a zone has become enshrined in the NPT, to use the
language of the 2010 NPT Action Plan, as "an essential element of the 1995 Conference
and the basis on which the Treaty was indefinitely extended without a vote in 1995"
The Resolution has and will continue to have a central status within the NPT
framework and its Review Process. It remains the only one that has ever been adopted
by any of the Review Conferences on a specific regional case. This reflects the specific
situation of the Middle East and this case's relationship with international peace and
security.

However, despite the crucial importance of the 1995 resolution to the integrity
and the sustainability of the Treaty, it remains unfulfilled This continues to be the
case despite the agreement in 2010 on practical steps to implement it. This latest
attempt was indeed compromised by the lack of sufficient political will by some of the
depositaries of the 1995 Resolution. Meanwhile, the unilateral announcement of the
Conference's postponement, without an acceptable reason and without consultation
with States of the region, not only wasted an additional five years, but added to a
record of unfulfilled commitments.
Mr. Chairman,

Throughout the last five years, Egypt and the Arab Group spared no effort to
implement the 2010 Action Plan pertaining to the Middle East, and constantly
engaging positively with the facilitator's efforts. This was strongly demonstrated by
I

the full engagement in the informal meetings convened in Vienna, Glion and Geneva,
which is amply reflected in the annexes of the Arab working paper. Regrettably, the
positive Arab interaction was not reciprocated, but was rather met by unreasonable
efforts to empty the previously agreed Conference and mandate of its substantive
content~

and to launch an open-ended and futile pre-negotiation process lacking a

specified time-frame, in the absence of a clear role by the United Nations. This

derailed the process laid out in the 2010 Review Conference, and it threatened to
undermine the 1995 Middle East Resolution, if not the whole 1995 Extension package.
Indeed, instead of achieving any real progress towards implementing the 1995
Middle East resolution, which aims to establish a Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and
other Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East, the consultations in Geneva
and Glion merely aimed at giving a false impression to the international community
that there was progress, while at the same time eroding confidence and entrenching
divergence and differences that can only block any effort to achieve the resolution's
objective. After five rounds of going in circles, it was very clear that such informal
meetings have reached their point of diminishing return. Indeed, the last two years
have shown that the process lacked vision, clarity, transparency, structure, and above
all political will.
You will hear from some delegations today that the mere fact that the parties sat
together after so many years was progress in itself. However, if these direct
engagements have brought the parties further apart -as they did - rather than
pointing the way forward to launching the conference, then truly the meetings cannot
be considered progress.

Mr. Chairman,

We cannot wait forever for the launching of a process that would lead to the
establishment of this zone, a process that was repeatedly committed to within the
NPT. We cannot continue to attend meetings and agree on outcomes that do not get
implemented, yet to be expected to abide by the concessions we gave for such
outcomes.
In this context, it is important to underline the fact that, with the failure to hold
the 2012 Conference and the end of the 2015 Review cycle, the mandate of the
Facilitator, as stipulated in the 2010 Action Plan, has elapsed.
Business as usual is no longer an option. A fresh approach is not only needed but is

imperative.
Mr. Chairman

We are here with a view to be forward looking in a positive and constructive
manner. We are not interested in a blame game. We are here to discuss new ways to
achieve our original objective; the establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of
Nuclear Weapons and all other Weapons of Mass Destruction. Towards this end, the
Non-Aligned Movement and the Arab Group have both presented working papers

providing a simplified approach laying out practical and detailed steps for initiating
the implementation of the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East.
The working papers submitted by the Non Aligned Movement and the Arab
Group both provide a programmatic and realistic proposal for launching the process
through convening the conference. The elements in the Working Papers are in
accordance with the principles for the establishment of Nuclear Weapon Free Zones as
adopted by the UN General Assembly1 and by the UN Disarmament Commission2• The
Working Papers propose the following:
1. The United Nations Secretary General shall convene a conference within 180
days from the adoption of the 2015 NPT Review Conference Final Document,
aiming at launching a process to conclude a legally binding Treaty establishing
a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons, and all Other Weapons of Mass
Destruction.
2. The UNSG shall invite all States of the Middle East region to attend the Middle
East NW & WMD Free Zone Conference. The UNSG shall exert all efforts and

11.All UN Member States and NPT States Parties are requested to exert all efforts
to support the convening of the Middle East NW & WMD Free Zone Conference
and the full implementation of the 1995 Resolution.
Mr. Chair,
We strongly call on the conference to adopt this proposal by consensus so as to
begin to fulfill the unimplemented obligations agreed upon 20 years ago in the 1995
resolution.
Convening the Middle East Conference is not an end in itself but a means to
launch the process, perhaps this is the last opportunity to regain the credibility of the
Treaty, and the relevant review conferences 1995, 2000, 2010 and to reaffirm that the
Treaty represents the most effective legal instrument for the preservation of
international peace and security.
Mr. Chair,

We call on the conference to take a step forward rather than two steps back. Let
our message to the world be a strong and positive one; that the NPT parties
collectively are able and willing - I reiterate, willing - after 20 years, to take concrete
steps to establishing a Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass
Destruction in the Middle East.
I thank you Mr. Chair.
