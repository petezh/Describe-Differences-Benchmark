Mr. Chairman,
Argentina
is well aware of the need to keep a reliable
and robust verification
regime,
so as to prevent the
development
of nuclear programs
with military purpose.
IAEA's safeguards
system has become,
in this regard, a
fundamental
and indispensable
pillar of the international
non-proliferation
regime.
Safeguards
administered
by the Agency create the indispensable
and feasible environment
to enhance
peaceful
nuclear cooperation.
Its implementation
must be guided by Article IV of the NPT and the Statute of the IAEA underscoring
the need to preserve
its credibility,
effectiveness
and integrity.
We need a modern,
robust and
technologically
current safeguards
system.

Argentina
considers
that no new concept or substantial
modification
can be introduced
to safeguards
unless it is
through
an adequate,
open and active consultation
process with States. Moreover,
the introduction
of any new
obligation
must be subject
to the final sovereign
decision
of States,
bearing
in mind the obligations
and
commitments
established
in the specific safeguards
agreements
in force.

with

the Statute
of the IAEA and the legal obligations
of the States.
Precisely,
it was in those cases where
discrepancies
and differences
existed regarding
nuclear activities
under safeguards
that international
peace and
security were affected. To protect and strengthen
the IAEA safeguards
regime is, therefore,
imperative.
Mr. Chairman,
At the regional
level, Argentina
and Brazil
have established,
through
the Argentine-Brazilian
Agency
for
Accountability
and Control of Nuclear Materials
(ABACC),
the only bi-national
system under which two countries
subject their nuclear installations
to mutual inspections
under a quadripartite
Agreement

ABACC
is a paradigm-setting

and become a Party. Furthermore,
it is useful not to forget that it included flexible clauses for its
entry into force, which contributed
to consolidate
the regime while political conditions
matured.
