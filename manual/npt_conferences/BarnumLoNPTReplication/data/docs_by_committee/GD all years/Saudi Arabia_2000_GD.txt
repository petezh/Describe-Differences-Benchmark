IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE AT THE OUTSET OF MY STATEMENT TO CONVEY MY SINCERE CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR ELECTION AS A CHAIRMAN OF THE 2000 REVIEW CONFERENCE OF THE STATES PARTIES TO THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, YOUR ELECTION TO THIS POSITION REFLECTS THE RESPECT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR YOUR PERSON AND THE HIGH REGARD FOR YOUR BROTHERLY COUNTRY.
I AM CONFIDENT THAT YOUR CHAIRMANSHIP OF THIS CONFERENCE AND YOUR WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES WHICH WE ALL ASPIRE TO AND ENDEAVOR TO REACH IN THIS CONFERENCE. I WOULD LIKE TO AFFIRM THE DESIRE AND READINESS OF THE DELEGATION OF MY COUNTRY TO COOPERATE WITH YOU IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF OUR WORK.
I WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY OUR APPRECIATION AND ESTEEM OF YOUR PREDECESSOR, MR. JAYANTHA DHANAPALA, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CONFERENCE WHICH WAS HELD IN 1995,
WHO DESERVES COMMENDATION FOR HIS KNOWN EXPERTISE IN CHAIRING THAT CONFERENCE SUCCESSFULLY,;: - : n v â€¢ K,-, , .
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE SECRETARY- GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS, H.E. MR. KOFI ANNAN, FOR HIS EFFORTS IN REDUCING TENSION AND HIS ENDEAVORS TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND SECURITY AROUND THE WORLD.
MR. CHAIRMAN,
THE FOUNDERS OF THE UNITED NATIONS ENDEAVORED TO LAY THE FOUNDATION TO ENSURE THAT HUMANITY WILL NOT BE EXPOSED TO THE DANGERS OF WAR AND DESTRUCTION. MAINTAINING PEACE AND SECURITY WAS AMONG THE FOREMOST OBJECTIVES INCLUDED IN THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER, AMONG OTHER PRINCIPLES, TO ACHIEVE THOSE NOBLE OBJECTIVES. AMONG THOSE OBJECTIVES ARE RESOLVING INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS BY PEACEFUL MEANS AND AVOIDING THE USE OF FORCE AND THE THREAT TO USE IT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 1 OF DECEMBER 24,1946 DID NOT ONLY CALL FOR DISARMAMENT BUT ALSO CALLED FOR THE DISARMAMENT OF ALL WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.
THE COLD WAR WITH ITS ATTENDANT CONFLICTS, CONFRONTATIONS, AND STRATEGIES OF MUTUAL DETERRENCE HAS RESULTED IN THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE, WHICH
REPRESENTED, AND STILL DOES, A REAL THREAT TO THE HUMAN RACE. THE NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY^ MORE THAN 30 YEARS AGO, WAS AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO LIMIT NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION AND AN EFFORT TO DESTROY ALL NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THUS MAKING THE NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY A LEGAL DOCUMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ACHIEVING INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY.
MR. CHAIRMAN,
CONVENING OUR CONFERENCE AT THE DAWN OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS A PRECIOUS OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE UNIVERSAL COMMITMENT TO THE NON- PROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT). IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT AN OBJECTIVE EVALUATION SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY WHAT WAS ACHIEVED AND DEFINE THE AREAS WHERE MORE PROGRESS MAY BE REALIZED IN THE FUTURE TO STRENGTHEN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TREATY AND ACHIEVE ITS UNIVERSALITY.
MR. CHAIRMAN,
DESPITE THE POSITIVE RESULTS THAT WERE ACHIEVED BY THE NON-PROLIFERATION REGIME AND ALTHOUGH WE WELCOME THE UNLIMITED EXTENSION OF THE NPT, WE AREVERY CONCERNED BECAUSE THE WORLD IS FARTHER FROM ACHIEVING THE PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES OFTMS TREATY. AND DESPITE SOME LIMITED PROGRESS AMONG THE NUCLEAR COUNTRIES ON THE UNILATERAL AND BI-LATERAL LEVELS TO REDUCE THEIR NUCLEAR ARSENALS, AND CONTRARY TO THE INTENTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS WHICH LED TO THE RATIFICATION AND EXTENSION OF THE NPT, THE PARTIES TO THE TREATY COULD NOT HALT THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND ESTABLISH A

FAIR EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE COMMITMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE NUCLEAR COUNTRIES AND THOSE WHO DO NOT POSSESS THOSE WEAPONS WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO TOTALLY ELIMINATE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE WORLD IS BEING PLAGUED BY LARGE ARSENALS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN MAJOR NUCLEAR STATES IN ADDITION TO THE SPREAD OF SUCH WEAPONS TO OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE MAJOR POWERS' LACK OF ADHERENCE TO THEIR COMMITMENT IN THE FIELD OF NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AND THEIR DOUBLE STANDARDS IN DEALING WITH THOSE COUNTRIES AS AN EXCUSE AND AN INCENTIVE TO GO AHEAD AND CONDUCT NUCLEAR TESTS AND PRODUCTION OF SUCH WEAPONS. THIS ISSUE SPREADS DOUBTS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS AND CREDIBILITY OF THE NPT IN ACHIEVING ITS MAIN OBJECTIVES AND THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MAJOR NUCLEAR STATES IN THIS REGARD.
THE NUCLEAR ; STATES HAVE TO BE REMINDED.. ,TO EMPHASIZE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY OF NOT HELPING OR ENCOURAGING NON-NUCLEAR STATES IN MANUFACTURING, PRODUCING, STOCKPILING, OR ACQUIRING NUCLEAR WEAPONS BY ANY MEANS, DIRECT OR INDIRECT. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CANNOT ACCEPT ANY LENIENCY IN DEALING WITH THE SERIOUS CHALLENGES OF THE SAFETY AND CREDIBILITY OF THE NPT, ESPECIALLY ACTIONS BY THE NUCLEAR STATES WHICH GIVE INTENTIONAL OR NON- INTENTIONAL SIGNALS TO STATES THAT ENDEAVOR TO ACQUIRE NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHEREBY SUCH STATES FEEL FREE TO ACQUIRE AND POSSESS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
WE WOULD LIKE TO REFER HERE TO THE DECLARATION OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL SUMMIT OF JANUARY 1992 WHICH DECLARED THAT THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS REPRESENTS A THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY, AND THAT THE MEMBERS ARE COMMITTED TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TO TAKE PROPER MEASURES TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE. THE DECLARATION ALSO EMPHASIZED THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF EFFECTIVE CONTROL MEASURES BY THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA) IN ADHERING TO THIS TREATY, THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING EFFECTIVE MEASURES
TO CONTROL EXPORTS, AND THAT MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL WILL TAKE APPROPRIATE MEASURES IN THE FACE OF ANY VIOLATION COMMUNICATED BY THE IAEA.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE NON-NUCLEAR STATES MUST HAVE GUARANTEES THAT THEY WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO NUCLEAR ATTACKS OR THE THREAT THEREOF. SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 984 (1995) AND THE INDIVIDUAL STATEMENTS MADE BY THE NUCLEAR t STATES COULD BE CONSIDERED STEPS TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE. HOWEVER, THE ISSUE REQUIRES A DOCUMENT THAT IS INTERNATIONALLY NEGOTIATED AND LEGALLY BINDING AND WHICH IS UNCONDITIONAL AND UNLIMITED, WHICH GUARANTEES THAT NON-NUCLEAR STATES WILL NOT BE SUB JECTED TO NUCLEAR ATTACKS.
THERE IS A PRESSING NEED TO EXERT MORE EFFORTS AND DETERMINATION ON THE PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO MAKE NON-PROLIFERATION OBLIGATORY. THIS WELL NOT BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT THE COLLECTIVE POLITICAL WILL TO STRENGTHEN THE NON-PROLIFERATION SYSTEM AND THE CONVICTION OF THE WORLD OF REDUCING THE POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS, AS WELL AS THE TOTAL COMMITMENT TO IMPLEMENT EXISTING TREATIES THAT CALL FOR DISARMAMENT AND REDUCTION OF NUCLEAR STOCKPILES.
MR. CHAIRMAN,
THE STATES WHICH APPROVED THE UNLIMITED EXTENSION OF THE NPT IN 1995 ENDEAVORED TO CLOSE THE GAPS AND DEAL WITH THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT WERE RECOGNIZED BY MOST OF THE NUCLEAR STATES WHO ARE PARTIES TO THE TREATY. THE DECISION TO AN UNLIMITED EXTENSION WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE WITHOUT
ACHIEVING A COMPLETE REALITY THAT INCLUDED THREE
*
RESOLUTIONS IN ADDITION TO THE ONE RELATED TO THE MIDDLE EAST. HOWEVER, WE NOTICED THAT SINCE THE FIRST MEETING OF THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE WHICH WAS HELD IN APRIL 1997 IN NEW YORK, AND THROUGH THE SECOND AND THIRD MEETING OF THE COMMITTEE DURING THE FOLLOWING YEAR, THAT THERE ARE SERIOUS EFFORTS TO WEAKEN AND FRUSTRATE THE MIDDLE EAST RESOLUTION. SUCH ATTEMPTS RESULTED IN OBSTRUCTING THOSE MEETINGS AND THEIR FAILURE TO REACH ANY RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS MEETING, EXCEPT FOR THE PROCEDURAL ISSUES THAT WERE AGREED UPON. THUS, THE FIRST CONFERENCE AFTER THE EXTENSION SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON THE TREATY AS A BASIS FOR REVIEW AND EVALUATION, IT SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE AGREED UPON IN 1995. THEREFORE, ANY ATTEMPTS TO SELECTIVELY CHOOSE SOME ITEMS AND AVOID OTHERS WILL RESULT IN A NEW FAILURE IN THIS CONFERENCE.MR. CHAIRMAN,
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA PAYS GREAT ATTENTION TO THE EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE ALL WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, ESPECIALLY THE ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST THROUGH ITS SUPPORT AND PARTICIPATION IN THE EFFORTS OF THE ARAB LEAGUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEAGUE'S RESOLUTION DURING ITS 101 SESSION IN 1994. THE RESOLUTION CALLS FOR MAKING THAT PART OF THE WORLD FREE OF ALL WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. A TECHNICAL COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED CONSISTING OF EXPERTS FROM THE ARAB STATES TO PREPARE A STUDY FOR A DRAFT TREATY WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MAKING THE MIDDLE EAST FREE OF ALL .WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION ESPECIALLY NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN WORKING SINCE 1994 TO DRAFT SUCH TREATY. THESE EFFORTS PORTRAY THE SERIOUS INTENTIONS OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES TO MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST FREE OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. ALTHOUGH ALL THE ARAB STATES HAVE RATIFIED THE NPT, THIS ACTION DOES NOT GUARANTEE THEIR SAFETY AFTER THE / REPEATED ISRAELI NUCLEAR THREAT AND ITS STARK DEFIANCE \ | OF INTERNATIONAL LEGALITY AS WELL AS THE FREQUENT / CALLS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY A GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION WHICH CALLS FOR MAKING THE MIDDLE EAST FREE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT HAS BEEN
REPEATEDLY PASSED BY CONSENSUS. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 4&7 (1981) AND 687 (1991).; THERE IS ALSO THE IAEA'S RESOLUTION CONCERNING THE MIDDLE EAST AND WHICH IS ADOPTED BY CONSENSUS BY THE AGENCY'S CONVENTION EVERY YEAR, AS WELL AS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION (NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST). IN THIS REGARD, IF PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS TO BE STABLE AND BALANCED, ISRAEL HAS TO GET RID OF ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARSENAL, AND JOIN THE NPT AND SUBJECT ITS NUCLEAR FACILITIES TO INTERNATIONAL INSPECTION BY THE IAEA WHICH WILL ENHANCE STABILITY AND SECURITY IN THE REGION.
MR. CHAIRMAN,
AT A TIME WHEN THE NPT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE ARAB STATES WHICH WAS EVIDENT IN THE PARTICIPATION OF THE ARAB STATES IN DRAFTING THE ORIGINAL TREATY AND WERE AMONG THE FIRST TO SIGN, RATIFY, AND JOIN, ISRAEL REFUSES TO SIGN THE TREATY AND CREATE OBSTACLES TO THE PROCESS OF MAKING THE REGION A NUCLEAR FREE ZONE. ISRAEL CONTINUES TO REFUSE THE APPEALS OF THE UNITED NATIONS, THE IAEA AND THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT, AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ISLAMIC CONFERENCE TO DESIST FROM PRODUCING, EXPERIMENTING OR STOCKPILING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. ISRAEL CONTINUES TO REFUSE TO SUBJECT ITS
NUCLEAR FACILITIES TO IAEA INSPECTIONS. ISRAEL IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT POSSESSES NUCLEAR AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION.
ISRAEL'S POSITION AND ALL ITS JUSTIFICATIONS CLEARLY CONTRADICT ITS CALLS FOR PEACE, BECAUSE TRUE PEACE MUST BE FOUNDED ON TRUST AND GOOD INTENTIONS AMONG THE PEOPLES AND STATES IN THE REGION, NOT BY POSSESSING NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THE THREAT TO USE THEM OR BY ITS POLICIES TO ACHIEVE HEGEMONY. ALL OF WHICH WILL BE A CAUSE FOR CONCERN AND A THREAT NOT ONLY TO THE PEOPLES IN THE REGION BUT ALSO A THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY.
ISRAEL'S. BEING OUTSIDE THE REGIME OF THE TREATY, ITS CONTINUOUS DEFIANCE OF FREQUENT INTERNATIONAL APPEALS TO JOIN THE NPT AND SUBJECTING ITS NUCLEAR FACILITIES TO IAEA'S INSPECTIONS, WILL NOT BE RESOLVED OR CORRECTED BY USING DOUBLE STANDARDS TOWARDS IT. THIS BEHAVIOR WILL NOT HELP IN NON-PROLIFERATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. RATHER, ISRAEL'S COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL APPEALS AND JOINING THE NPT AND SUBJECTING ITS NUCLEAR FACILITIES TO INTERNATIONAL INSPECTION WILL POSITIVELY IMPACT THE PEACE PROCESS INTHE MIDDLE EAST AND ENHANCE PEACEFUL CURRENTS AND INTENTIONS IN THE REGION. -
MR. CHAIRMAN,
SAUDI ARABIA'S SIGNING OF THE NPT AND ITS REFUSAL TO JOIN THE RACE FOR PRODUCTION AND USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AS WELL AS ITS REFUSAL TO ALLOW THE STOCKPILING OF SUCH WEAPONS ON ITS TERRITORIES AND ITS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE 1995 CONVENTION AND THE PREPARATORY MEETINGS OF THIS CONFERENCE, AND ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS ORGANIZATION, AND SIGNING THE CONVENTION TO PROHIBIT THE MANUFACTURE, PRODUCTION, STOCKPILING AND USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND THE DESTRUCTION OF SUCH WEAPONS, REPRESENTS A FIRM POLICY DUE TO ITS BELIEF IN SECURITY FOR ALL AND ITS CALL FOR PEACE AND INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION FOR THE WELFARE OF HUMANITY.
MR. CHAIRMAN,
MY COUNTRY'S DELEGATION WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE OF THE IAEA AND ITS SAFETY SYSTEM AS IMPORTANT AND VITAL FOR THE NPT. WE AFFIRM
AGAIN OUR FIRM SUPPORT TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND CAPABILITIES OF ITS SAFETY AND INSPECTION REGIME.
MR. CHAIRMAN,
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY IS AN INDIVISIBLE WHOLE AND PEACE AND SECURITY IS A JUST AND FAIR DEMAND FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. OUR CONFERENCE CANNOT DEAL WITH ONE ASPECT OF THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE WITHOUT PAYING ATTENTION TO OTHERS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS CONFERENCE TO DRAFT A DOCUMENT THAT INCLUDE A VISION OF THE FUTURE BASED ON DEALING WITH THE NEGATIVE AND DEFECTIVE ASPECTS OF THE PAST, AND EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO ACHIEVE INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS, AND URGE ALL STATES TO JOINT THE NPT AND EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST FREE OF ALL WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. IT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO AFFIRM THE COMMITMENT TO THE PREAMBLE OF THE TREATY WHICH URGES ALL STATES TO EXERT ALL EFFORTS TO AVOID NUCLEAR WAR AND THE COMMITMENT OF THE NUCLEAR STATES TO EXERT ALL EFFORTS TO STOP THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE AND REDUCE THOSE WEAPONS AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD COMPLETE AND TOTAL NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT. THESE STEPS REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY ON THE PART OF NUCLEAR STATES TO REVEAL THEIR STOCKPILES.
MR. CHAIRMAN,
THE TWO WORLD WARS THAT PLAGUED HUMANITY MADE IT AWARE THAT ANY NUCLEAR WAR IN THE FUTURE MEANS THE END OF LIFE ON THIS PLANET. HUMANITY VIEWS THIS CONFERENCE WITH THE HOPE THAT ALL EFFORTS WILL COMBINE TO PARTICIPATE IN BUILDING A WORLD THAT IS FREE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THEY ALL LOOK WITH HOPE FOR THE NEW CENTURY BASED ON SINCERE INTENTIONS AND EMPLOY THE NOBLE IDEALS OF THE CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS. IT ALSO ENDEAVORS TO BEGIN THE MILLENNIUM WHEN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ARE NOT BASED ON THE USE OF FORCE AND SUBJUGATION, BUT RATHER ON HUMAN FRATERNITY, BASED ON EQUALITY AND ASPIRING FOR COOPERATION.
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.
