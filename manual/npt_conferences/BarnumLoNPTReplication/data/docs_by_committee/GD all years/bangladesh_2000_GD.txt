
Mr. Chairman, 
We are pleased to see you Chair the Sixth Review Meeting of the NPT. On behalf of the Bangladesh delegation and on my own behalf, I extend to you our sincere congratulations on your unanimous election. We are confident that your wisdom and stewardship will guide our deliberations to a successful outcome. 
Mr. Chairman, 
In a few months time, the leaders of the world will assemble at these United Nations for the Millennium Summit. Their objective will surely provide a vision for the 21st century in which our future generations would be able to live in a world without the fear of a nuclear war. That vision must be shaped by the realization that nuclear weapons are singularly the most dangerous threat to humankind and to civilization. Let the nightmares of Hiroshima and Nagasaki forever haunt us of the horrendous consequences of the fallout of nuclear explosions and inspire us to strengthen our resolve to eradicate nuclear weapons front the face of this earth. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Nuclear non proliferation is not an illusion. It is an achievable target. What we need is the political will. We are fortunate to have before us the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty. For the past thirty two years the NPT has been by far the most important and widely accepted instrument for non proliferation. The authors of the Treaty had the far sight to provide the provision for its review to ensure its relevance. It is for the sixth time that we are gathered for this purpose. Let us do it well, taking concrete actions for herein lies the key to the survival of our species. 
The relevance and importance of the 2000 Review Conference of the NPT cannot be overemphasized. It takes place at the beginning of a new millennium and therefore places before us an opportunity to renew our commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. It is the sincere hope of my delegation that the 187 states parties to the NPT will be able to substantially contribute to the success of this Review Meeting to strengthen the NPT regime and its review process and to advance its universality. 
Mr. Chairman, 
My delegation fully endorses the views of the Secretary General that while the NPT was needed more than ever, it has still remained a paradox. We support the five benchmarks set by the Secretary General in his statement to this Conference and we are ready to cooperate with him towards achieving those targets. 
The concerns over non compliance of the safeguard provisions of the NPT and the differences in opinion on the full implementation of the NPT and the existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons pose a clear and present danger. The nuclearization of South Asia is of particular concern to us and we would urge India and Pakistan to join the NPT regime and to sign the CTBT. 
We also remain concerned about the potential nuclearization of the Middle East and we support the establishment of a Nuclear Free Zone in that region as well as in other parts of the world. We congratulate the State parties that have concluded agreements for establishing two new Nuclear Weapons Free Zone in South East Asia and Africa since 1995. 
Despite the pessimism that clouds the progress in nuclear disarmament, there are encouraging signs. Since 1995, nine additional states have acceded to the NPT. The number of signatories and ratifiers of the CTBT continues to grow. Nuclear Weapons State have also taken some positive decisions to move the disarmament process forward and we welcome the decision of the Russian Federation to ratify the START II and the CTBT and reductions in their nuclear stockpiles. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Since her inception, disarmament has been a cornerstone of the foreign policy of Bangladesh. We are bound by our Constitution to general and complete disarmament. The Founding Father of our Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had reaffirmed this binding commitment in unequivocal terms in his address to the General Assembly more than twenty five years ago in these very premises. The present Government in Bangladesh under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has firmly upheld the cause of general and complete disarmament including nuclear disarmament. Immediately after forming the Government, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina took the initiative of being the first leader from South Asia to sign the CTBT when it was opened for signature in 1996. Bangladesh's historic ratification of the CTBT in March 2000 was a bold step taken by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to reiterate Bangladesh's commitment to nuclear non proliferation. We are contributing a seismic station to the International Monitoring System of the CTBT verification regime. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Bangladesh's support to the NPT regime is unequivocal. A State party to the NPT, Bangladesh has consciously given up its option to go nuclear. We have concluded safeguards agreement with the IAEA and are actively considering conclusion of an Additional Protocol to further contribute to the non-proliferation regime. We call upon those State parties that have not yet done so to conclude safeguards agreement with the IAEA and further strengthen its capacity to verify compliance. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Bangladesh has actively contributed towards the process of indefinitely extending the NPT's future during the 1995 Review Conference. We welcomed the forward looking decisions of the 1995 Conference which we believe laid the grounds for a strengthened review process and the process of continuity in deciding the future of the Treaty's success and to the ultimate goal of total elimination of nuclear weapons. 
We gave our full support to the Programme of Action adopted in 1995 for realizing the principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. We welcome the progresses that have been achieved since setting out of the 1995 decisions and POA particularly the conclusion of a CTBT, increased accessions to the NPT and a reduction in the aggregate number of deployed nuclear weapons. It may now be the time to consider stetting up an elected Executive Council to act on behalf of NPT parties to deal with questions of non-compliance and implementation. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Bangladesh believes that 2000 is a time to look ahead keeping the past in mind, for the NPT review process to realize its full potential. In fact, this Conference provides the first opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of the new review process for maintaining a strong, credible and permanent regime to reduce nuclear dangers and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It also provides us with the opportunity to assess the implementation of the Treaty's provisions during the last five-years, to identify the areas in which and the means through which, we can seek further progress to strengthen the review and the implementation process of the Treaty and achieve its universality. 
Mr. Chairman, 
As a member and President of the 200th session of the CD, it has been Bangladesh's single most priority to play a moderating and facilitating role in enhancing appreciation of differences, bridging gaps and in creating consensus. Bangladesh would continue to contribute in all earnestness to the process of consensus-building in adopting a declaration of principles and objectives to be achieved by 2005, an agreed document setting future guidelines to enhance the strengthened review process and make the treaty universal. 
Bangladesh considers the Conference on Disarmament as the only consensual universal multilateral negotiating body on disarmament issues. The current impasse in the CD is indeed not desirable. During our current tenure as President of the CD, Bangladesh has worked in all earnestness through consultations to bridge the gaps and arrive at an agreement on the CD's work programme. We feel that the 2000 Review Conference should make every effort to forward the common component of work of the CD and the 1995 POA specially on negotiations on a FMCT and also on working groups on nuclear disarmament, security assurances and prevention of an arms race in the outer space. 
Mr. Chairman, 
It is disheartening that the Treaty is short of only 4 more accessions to reach universality. Bangladesh remains committed to pursue universal adherence of the NPT and calls on the 2000 Conference and the concerned States that are yet to be party to the NPT to make renewed commitment towards universality of the Treaty. In this context Bangladesh recalls UN Security Council Resolution 1172 of June 1998 which urged "India, Pakistan and all other States that have not yet done so to become parties to the NPT and the CTBT without delay and without conditions". 
Mr. Chairman, 
Bangladesh attaches high priority to the implementation of Article IV of the Treaty that affirms the "inalienable rights of all parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination". We must not overlook the fact that one of the major incentives for non-nuclear weapons Sates to join the NPT is to enjoy the rights committed Article IV. We feel disappointed that the non-nuclear developing States which are striving hard to contribute most constructively to the cause of nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and international peace and security, their access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes remains illusive even after 32 years of the NPT's coming into force. 
We call upon the 2000 Conference to look deeper into the issue of exchange of equipment, materials and information on peaceful uses of nuclear energy under review of Decision 2 of the 1995 Conference and help strike a balance between our expectations and benefits from the NPT. We hope that the nuclear suppliers group which has been established for this purpose will be transparent in its operation and arbitrary and discriminatory restraints on use of l nuclear technology for peaceful purposes will not be imposed. The NPT must be adhered to by its state parties in letter and sprit. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The success of the Review Conference will depend on narrowing the differences and revitalizing global will towards full realization of the NPT. We must strive to agree now and here what we failed to agree upon during the preparatory process for 2000. Even if differences remain on substantive issues, it would be essential for the 2000 Conference to ensure that the review process moves forward. 
As a non-nuclear country committed to a culture of peace and development we urge all State parties to refocus on the link between disarmament and development. The cost of any increase in nuclear weapons will not only have serious implications on international peace and security but also on development, the agenda for more than two thirds population of this planet. Let us all recommit ourselves to fulfil that agenda.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
