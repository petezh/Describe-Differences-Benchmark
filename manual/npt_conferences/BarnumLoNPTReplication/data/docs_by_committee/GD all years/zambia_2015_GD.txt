STATEMENT
BY
BRIG. GEN. ERICK MWEWA
MILITARY ADVISOR OF THE REPUBLIC
OF ZAMBIA TO THE UNITED NATIONS
ATTHE
2015 REVIEW CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES
TO THE
TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF
NUCLEAR WEAPONS
New York, NY
April 2015 
MADAM PRESIDENT,
LET ME JOIN OTHER SPEAKERS WHO HAVE SPOKEN BEFORE ME, TO
CONGRATULATE YOU IN YOUR ELECTION TO PRESIDE OVER THIS
NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY REVIEW CONFERENCE. MY
DELEGATION IS CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL DIRECT PROCEEDINGS TO
A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION AND WE WISH TO EXPRESS OUR
UNRESERVED SUPPORT DURING YOUR TENURE AS CHAIR. MY
DELEGATION ALSO WISHES TO COMMEND THE SECRETARIAT ON THE
EXCELLENT WORK DONE TOWARDS ORGANISING THE CONFERENCE.
ZAMBIA REGARDS THIS EVENT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN
OUR COMMITMENT TOWARDS ATTAINING BROADER INTERNATIONAL
PEACE AND SECURITY.
ZAMBIA ALIGNS WITH THE STATEMENTS DELIVERED BY
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT AND THE
AFRICAN GROUP IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR WORK.
MADAM PRESIDENT, ALLOW ME NOW TO HIGHLIGHT THE POSmON OF
MY COUNTRY.
ZAMBIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG AND COMMITTED ADVOCATE OF
GENERAL AND COMPLETE DISARMAMENT. ZAMBIA REAFFIRMS ITS
COMMITMENT TO THE GOAL OF THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR
WEAPONS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NUCLEAR-WEAPON FREEWORLD.
CONSIDERING THE DEVASTATION THAT WOULD BE VISITED
UPON ALL MANKIND BY ANY USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND NOTING
THAT THERE IS NO COMPETENT INTERNATIONAL CAPACITY TO
ADDRESS THE RESULTING CATASTROPHIC HUMANITARIAN
CONSEQUENCES, ZAMBIA WELCOMES RECENT GLOBAL FOCUS ON THE
HUMANITARIAN IMPACT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHICH HAS BROUGHT
MUCH NEEDED ENERGY AND IMPETUS TO DISCUSSIONS ON NUCLEAR
DISARMAMENT.
MADAM PRESIDENT,
ZAMBIA ASSOCIATES ITSELF WITH THE PLEDGE ISSUED ATTHE VIENNA
CONFERENCE "TO FILL THE LEGAL GAP" FOR THE PROHIBmON AND
ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND WILL CONTINUE
1 
ADVOCATING THAT THE FILLING OF THE GAP WILL REQUIRE THE
NEGOTIATION OF A TREATY THAT CLEARLY PROHIBITS NUCLEAR
WEAPONS BASED ON THEIR CATASTROPHIC HUMANITARIAN
CONSEQUENCES. MY GOVERNMENT FULLY ENDORSES THE FINDINGS
AND OUTCOMES OF THE OSLO AND VIENNA CONFERENCE.
MADAM PRESIDENT,
WE HAVE HAD THREE PREPARATORY COMMITTEES THAT HAVE
PRECEDED THIS MEETING, HOWEVER, WE WISH TO OBSERVE THAT
SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TOWARDS THE ADVANCEMENT OF
THE TREATY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, BUT THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN
SLOW ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO DISARMAMENT. MADAM
PRESIDENT, MORE EFFORT IS NEEDED BY ALL OF US TO ACHIEVE
COMPLIANCE OF PREVIOUSLY AGREED COMMITMENT.
MADAM PRESIDENT,
ZAMBIA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE INTERNATIONAL
ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA) AND RECOGNISES THE AGENCY AS
THE SOLE COMPETENT AUTHORITY FOR THE VERIFICATION OF
FULFILMENT OF SAFEGUARDS OBLIGATIONS ASSUMED BY STATE
PARTIES UNDER THE NPT. IN THIS REGARD, ZAMBIA CONTINUES TO
UNDERLINE THE IMPORTANCE OF STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THE IAEA
STATUE AND RELEVANT COMPREHENSIVE SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENTS
IN CONDUCTING VERIFICATION ACTIVmES.
MADAM PRESIDENT,
ZAMBIA FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NUCLEAR
WEAPON FREE ZONES IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS
THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IN THIS REGARD,
ZAMBIA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NUCLEAR
WEAPON FREE ZONE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS A PRIORITY AND URGES
ALL STAKE HOLDERS IN THE REGION TO IMPLEMENT IN FULL TI-IE 1995
RESOLUTIONS WHICH HAVE STILL REMAINED VALID.
2 
AS I CONCLUDE, ALLOW ME TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF
BRINGING THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNilY
INTO THE TREATY. ZAMBIA THEREFORE CALLS UPON THOSE
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NOT SIGNED AND RATIFIED THE NPT TO DO
SO, IN ORDER THAT THE TREATY ATIAINS UNIVERSALilY.
I THANKYOU.
