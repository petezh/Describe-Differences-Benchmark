

Mr. President, 
Allow me to begin by congratulating you on behalf of the delegation of the Lao People's Democratic Republic on your election to the presidency of the present 2000 Review Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons (NPT). We are confident that with your rich diplomatic skills and broad experience in international relations. you will guide the work of this important conference to a successful conclusion. In the discharge of your duties, my delegation assures you of its full support and cooperation. 
Mr. President, 
In 1995 the international community had indefinitely extended the NPT and strongly reaffirmed its crucial role in the promotion of nuclear disarmament, the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation as well as the enhancement of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In other words, the non-nuclear weapon States again agreed not to develop nor acquire nuclear weapons and the nuclear weapons States also agreed to negotiate in good faith to achieve nuclear disarmament. Five years have elapsed, the implementation of these agreements is much left to be desired. As a matter of fact, existing nuclear weapons continue to pose else greatest danger to the survival of the civilization of mankind. To our deep regret, nuclear weapons have been modernized, some nuclear weapons States moreover have set out new rationale for the use of these inhuman weapons and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has not yet entered into force etc. The situation in which we are, is not bright, the world community can not live up to its commitment made 30 years ago to nuclear disarmament. In the light of the above and given that nuclear weapons would not enhance international security, efforts should be made seriously and honestly by all states concerned particularly the nuclear weapon States which have the legal obligations to fulfil under Article VI of the Treaty namely to pursue in good faith arid bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects. 
Mr. President, 
The performance of the NPT over the past years had not yielded expected results. The negotiations on banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices have yet to begin. It is regrettable that very little progress on this issue has been achieved. In this regard, we hope that the Conference on Disarmament would early conclude the negotiations for a non-discriminatory and universally applicable treaty banning the production of fissile materials. In considering this issue, we stress the need to take into account that the nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament measures should be addressed in parallel. 
Mr. President, 
Learning lessons and experiences from the past about nuclear weapons danger, today as we are entering the new 21st century, the international community should make every effort to ensure that mankind can live without the threat of nuclear weapons. Indeed, my delegations hopes that this conference, at its current session would lay the groundwork for State Parties to the Treaty to agree to negotiate and conclude a legal instrument to assure the non-nuclear weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. In this context, we would like to emphasize that the issue of concluding a legal binding instrument on security assurances to non-nuclear weapons States deserves the utmost attention of the world community and should be strongly pursued. 
Mr. President, 
The Lao PDR welcomes the increasing membership of the State Parties to the NPT since it has entered into force in 1970. Such a growing number and the fact that 187 States are now parties to this Treaty, testifies to its global appeal for both nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. In this regard, we express the belief that the number of the State Parties to the NPT will further increase. 
The Lao PDR supports the strong aspirations of the peoples in many parts of the world in their efforts toward the creation of Nuclear Weapon Free Zones in their respective regions such as in South East Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, Africa, South, Pacific etc. The creation of those zones would provide those people in their regions to be free from the nuclear threat. In this context, we welcome the adoption of the principles and guidelines by the UN Disarmament Commission last year on the establishment of nuclear weapon free zones based on arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the regions concerned as well as the adoption by the Mongolian Parliament of the legislation on Mongolia's nuclear weapon free status. 
Mr. President, 
The requirement for the use of nuclear material, equipment and technology for promoting economic development continues to be an issue of importance to the third world. Those technology and equipment have largely contributed to science research for economic growth. In this regard, we would like to express our concern that those material, equipment anti technology are being restricted to developing countries. In our opinion, this practice is inconsistent with the prevailing international atmosphere of cooperation in the field of peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
Mr. President, 
In conclusion, my delegation believes that this conference will provide an excellent opportunity for all State Parties to evaluate and consider adopting new measures to ensure that the provisions of the NPT and the decisions adopted in 1995 are fully implemented. For its part, the Lao PDR will continue to cooperate fully with other State parties towards the achievement of the ultimate goal of the Treaty: the building o f a world free from nuclear weapons.
I thank you.
