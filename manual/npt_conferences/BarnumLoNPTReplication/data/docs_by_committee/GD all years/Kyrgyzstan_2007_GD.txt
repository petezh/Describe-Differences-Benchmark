Mr. Chairman,
Allow me to join the previous speakers in congratulating you on your assumption of the chairmanship of the 2007 NPT Preparatory Committee. I wish you every bit of success in your endeavors and you can count on the full support of our delegation.
I also would like to use this opportunity to express my appreciation to the International Atomic Energy Agency Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei and his colleagues at the IAEA.
Mr. Chairman,
We convene in Vienna at a very difficult moment for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Although States Parties may disagree about the precise nature of the challenges we face and the degree to which it is appropriate to characterize the situation as a crisis, my delegation is convinced that threats to the global nonproliferation regime are serious and require equally serious attention and action. It is imperative that we utilize this meeting of the Preparatory Committee to revive and reinforce the spirit of cooperation for nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation evident at the 2000 NPT Review Conference, but generally lacking at the most recent Review Conference in 2005.
Toward this goal, Mr. Chairman, my delegation hopes that this Preparatory Committee session will contribute to the strengthening of the review process as envisaged by the 1995 NP T Review and Extension Conference and reiterated and clarified by the 2000 Review Conference. My delegation is especially desirous that States Parties will be able to resolve in a timely fashion al! relevant procedural issues in order that attention also can be directed to matters of substance relating to the implementation of the Treaty, Decisions 1 and 2 and the Resolution on the Middle East from the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, as well the outcome of the 2000 Review Conference.
Mr. Chairman,
At the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, the Kyrgyz Republic applauded the adoption without a vote of three interconnected decisions and a resolution on the Middle East. Five years later, my delegation also supported the adoption of the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. This document presented a pragmatic, forward-looking set of objectives regarding disarmament and nonproliferation. Today, however, we must acknowledge that our initial high expectations from 1995 and 2000 remain, at best, only partially realized. Especially disappointing is the continued stalemate at the Conference on Disarmament, the failure to bring the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty into force, repudiation of the ABM Treaty, lack of visible progress in negotiating a verifiable Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, and the demise of both negotiated and voluntary reductions in strategic and non-strategic nuclear weapons.
It is my delegation's hope that during this new cycle of the review process we will address the implementation of the practical steps toward disarmament adopted at the 2000 Review Conference and discuss means to accelerate the reduction of all categories of nuclear weapons in a transparent and irreversible fashion. My delegation shares the views of those States Parties, who attach particular importance to the expeditious ratification and entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In this regard, I am pleased to note that the Kyrgyz Republic ratified the CTBT on 2nd October 2003.
Mr. Chairman,
One of the most promising approaches to disarmament and nonproliferation is the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones. Today, nuclear-weapon-free zones cover nearly the entire Southern Hemisphere, in addition to the Antarctic, the seabed, and outer space. The important role played by these zones is recognized by the United Nations Disarmament Commission, which in 1999 adopted by consensus a set of guidelines for their establishment.
In 1995, the NPT review process first took note of the initiative of the Central Asian states to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. My delegation is pleased to acknowledge the successful negotiation of the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon Free Zone, which was signed on September 8, 2007 and was recently ratified by the Kyrgyz Republic. The five Central Asian states are united in their belief that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in our region, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among our states, and taking into account our region's special characteristics, is an important disarmament and nonproliferation accomplishment that will strengthen peace and security at the regional and global levels.
Mr. Chairman,
The Kyrgyz Republic always has regarded the NPT as the cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, and it continues to do so. It also recognizes, however, that the world has changed significantly in recent years. New proliferation challenges have emerged and old ways of doing business will no longer suffice. In order for it to persevere, the Treaty and the broader regime must adapt to these changing circumstances, which include the growing risk of nuclear terrorism.
My delegation regards international safeguards and physical protection of nuciear materials and facilities as the first line of defense against nuclear terrorism. As such, the Kyrgyz Republic strongly endorses the International Atomic Energy Agency's efforts to strengthen the international safeguards system, including adoption of the Additional Protocol as the safeguards standard. The Kyrgyz Republic signed the Additional Protocol in January 2007. which will be ratified soon.
The Kyrgyz Republic also supports on-going efforts to strengthen the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 in order to address the new proliferation challenges posed by non-state actors. My country-plans to host a workshop related to implementing UN Security Council Resolution this autumn.
Creative efforts must be undertaken to reduce the possibility that terrorists could gain access to fissile material, and especially highly-enriched uranium, which could be used to make crude nuclear weapons. The Kyrgyz Republic supports efforts, such as those introduced by Norway at the 2005 NPT Review Conference, to enhance the security of existing stockpiles of highly-
enriched uranium, while minimizing the use of the highly-enriched uranium in the civilian nuclear sector. The Kyrgyz Republic also supports increased efforts to reinforce export controls and to combat illicit trafficking in sensitive nuclear material, and has adopted several domestic laws consistent with this objective.
My delegation notes with great satisfaction the adoption by the General Assembly on April 13, 2005 of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, initiated by the Russian Federation. The Kyrgyz Republic is convinced that this Convention can make an important contribution to combating nuclear terrorism, and is hopeful that it will soon enter into force. Kyrgyzstan also supports the initiative by President Putin on the establishment of multinational centers for supplying nuclear fuel cycle services as a means to promote peaceful nuclear cooperation and prevent nuclear proliferation.
Mr. Chairman,
Inadequate attention has been given in the past to the serious issue of mitigating the environmental consequences of nuclear weapons programs. As first articulated at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, and as noted in the consensus Final Document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference, there have been exceptional instances in which serious environmental consequences have resulted from uranium mining and associated nuclear fuel cycle activities in the production of nuclear weapons. This often overlooked environmental problem caused by nuclear weapons production and borne by the Kyrgyz Republic and other states, is another reason why my delegation and others from our region attach great importance to the work of this Preparatory Committee. In this connection, my delegation is pleased to note that on 18 March 2007 the Kyrgyz Republic acceded to Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management.
There are 92 objects with toxic radioactive wastes left by the mining industry on the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic. Basic parts of these objects are located in basins of the trans-boundary rivers. Many of them are in a dangerious condition. Motions of a landslip toward the rivers which feed Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and partially Kazakhstan are noted. It is perfectly clear that the given problem concerns not only Kyrgyzstan, but also the neighboring countries. So, it is absolutely necessary to take well-coordinated and effective efforts at all levels to ensure radioactive security in the region. It is noteworthy that the calls made at prior Review Conferences to the international community were not in vain. The Kyrgyz Republic appreciates the efforts made by the World Bank, EBRD, ADB, IAEA in solving the problem. Kyrgyzstan hopes that current undertakings to address this regional issue will be continued and expanded to complete the necessary rehabilitation in affected areas.
The Kyrgyz Republic would like to reiterate the call made, for all governments and international organizations that have expertise in the field of clean-up and disposal of radioactive contaminants to consider giving appropriate assistance as may be requested for remedial purposes in these affected areas.
My delegation also wishes to draw attention to another vital but often neglected issue-the role of education and training as tools to promote disarmament and nonproliferation. The Kyrgyz republic welcomes the recommendations of the UN Experts Group on the subject and shares the opinion expressed in UN General Assembly Resolution 57/60, adopted without a vote in fall 2002, that "the need has never been greater for disarmament and nonproliferation education." We appreciate the leadership shown by Japan, among other States Parties, in continuing to raise
the issue of education and training in the NPT context, and we look forward to working with other interested member States in developing practical steps to assist the implementation of the measures called for by the UN study. In this context, Kyrgyzstan hopes to establish a regional resource Center on issues of nuclear proliferation and nuclear waste management and looks forward to international cooperation in this matter.
Mr. Chairman,
The risks of inaction are too great. Although the great promise of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference package of disarmament and nonproliferation decisions has not yet been fulfilled, we must not lose sight of the principles and objectives that were then articulated and remain as compelling today as before.
Mr. Chairman,
The Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the opportunity to find common ground on the most important disarmament and nonproliferation issues in order to ensure the long-term integrity, effectiveness, and reievance of the NPT. My delegation pledges to work with you to accomplish that outcome
Thank you for your attention.
