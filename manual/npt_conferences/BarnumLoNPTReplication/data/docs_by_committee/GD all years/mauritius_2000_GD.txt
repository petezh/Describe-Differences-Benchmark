
Mr. President, 
I would like to associate myself with other delegations in congratulating you, on your election as President of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I wish to assure you of the total support and cooperation of my delegation to make this 2000 NPT Review Conference a successful event. Mr President, there is no doubt that your able leadership and diplomatic skill will guide this Conference to a fruitful outcome. 
At the heart of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is the aspiration of mankind across our planet to live in a world free from the threat of annihilation by nuclear weapons. This is clearly demonstrated in the fact that the NPT has rallied 187 parties committing themselves to work together to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons with the objective of achieving total nuclear disarmament and to co-operate in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We have just celebrated the 30th year of the entry into force of the NPT with a sense of satisfaction that the Treaty has largely been successful in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. Mauritius joined the NPT as soon as it was ready for signature and remains firmly committed to all its provisions. 
Mr. President, 
The objectives of the NPT are two-fold and both are inextricably inter-linked. First, the target has been to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons through a comprehensive nonproliferation regime. This has required the non-nuclear states parties to the Treaty to commit themselves never to embark on production of nuclear weapons. The other objective has been to bring about the total elimination of all existing nuclear weapons. This second objective is the crucial element of the NPT since otherwise there can be no rationale for the non-nuclear states to give up their nuclear option forever. In our view, the most important issue before this Review Conference is the largely non-fulfillment by the nuclear states of their part of the bargain under the NPT and to take appropriate decisions for the enforcement of nuclear disarmament. 
It is not just regrettable but most alarming that we embark on a new millennium with a huge deployment of 36,000 nuclear war-heads on our planet. This shows how little the nuclear powers have done to advance the cause of nuclear disarmament. On the other hand, there are efforts today to qualitatively enhance existing nuclear capabilities using new technologies and to weaponize the outer space. At stake in all this is the very credibility of the non-proliferation regime. 
Mr. President, 
We all know from the past that every step that is taken somewhere to up-grade weaponry, nuclear or non-nuclear, is taken a challenge by others to develop matching if not more advanced systems. It may not happen immediately in every case but over time it always happens. The doctrine of nuclear deterrence has resulted in greater proliferation of nuclear weapons and up-gradation of nuclear capability by one nation is bound similarly to escalate into a new nuclear arms race. Hence, Mauritius strongly believes that there is no alternative to total nuclear disarmament which must be achieved within an established timeframe. 
Mr. President, 
The end of the Cold War has presented opportunities for serious dialogue among the nuclear powers for reduction of their nuclear arsenals. We recognize that small steps were taken in this regard between Be United States and the Russian Federation in 1997 and also unilateral pledges have been made by the other nuclear powers to reduce their nuclear arsenals. In particular, we welcome the recent ratification of START II by Russia and also its decision to ratify CTBT. Mauritius is hopeful that the two major nuclear powers, the US and Russia will seize the opportunity now together with the other nuclear states to take the bold measures necessary for the realization of START III and to agree on a time-frame for the total denuclearization of our universe. The importance of establishing a time-frame in this regard cannot be overemphasized. Mauritius was disappointed that a time-frame for total elimination of nuclear weapons was not incorporated in the CTBT and for this reason above all we are not a signatory still. 
Mr. President, 
The 1995 NPT Review Conference envisioned not only the conclusion of CTBT by 1996 but inter-alia also the following: 
a. a fissile material cut-off treaty 
b. establishment of new nuclear free-zones 
c. determined pursuit by nuclear weapons states of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally with ultimate goal of eliminating these weapons. 
Unfortunately, five years later today we see no movement towards conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty and nuclear disarmament remains stalled. On the other hand, where non-nuclear states are concerned, two important nuclear-free zones, namely the Pelindaba and the Bangkok Treaties have been concluded since 1995. Mauritius is among the first to have ratified the Pelindaba Treaty and calls upon the states which have not done so yet to take steps for their early ratification to ensure that this important Treaty covering Africa enters into force as soon as possible. We urge the countries of the Middle East, Israel in particular, to resolutely take the necessary steps for the realization of a nuclear free zone covering the Middle East region. 
Mr. President, 
Mauritius deplores the protracted reluctance of the nuclear powers to fulfil their obligations under Article IV of the NPT, which provide for unimpeded and nondiscriminatory transfer of nuclear materials and technology for peaceful purposes to developing countries under the IAEA full-scope safeguards. This being the only tangible benefit that the developing countries expect out of NPT, the nuclear states have the responsibility to ensure the implementation of Article IV and to that effect take the appropriate measures together with IAEA. 
An area of increasing concern to developing countries is the transportation of nuclear wastes across the seas. Since the possibilities of vessels carrying nuclear waste running into accidents cannot be discounted, the lives of millions of people in countries washed by the waters through which the vessels travel as well the marine resources on which they depend so much are put in peril each time there is a movement of the hazardous materials. The situation is further aggravated by the absence of a proper compensation regime. Mauritius is of the view that this important issue must be fully addressed at this NPT Review Conference. 
Mr. President, 
The stationing of nuclear weapons be it on land, sea or space present a serious danger to populations around. Therefore, Mauritius believes in the establishment of a Registry under the IAEA where records can be kept of all nuclear weapons wherever these are stationed. The Registry should be accessible under strict conditions to sovereign governments which have the responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their peoples. 
Finally, Mr. President, Mauritius strongly supports the early convening of an international conference on nuclear disarmament. We must recognize the fact that today there are nuclear states outside the purview of the NPT and CTBT and that words of condemnation of their nuclear status or invitations to them to voluntarily become parties to these regimes will not in themselves resolve the issue. There is absolute need now to enlarge the scope of discussion of nuclear issues beyond the existing parameters of NPT and only an international Conference can address all the issues in a new global perspective. An international conference on disarmament must also seriously address the question of the growing threat of nuclear terrorism.
