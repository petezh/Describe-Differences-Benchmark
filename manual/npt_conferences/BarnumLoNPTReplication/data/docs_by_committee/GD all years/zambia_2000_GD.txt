
Mr. Chairman, 
Your Excellencies, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
My delegation is pleased that your Excellency, Ambassador Abdallah Baali, a national of Algeria, a country with which Zambia maintains friendly relations is presiding over the First Review Conference following the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995. I have every confidence that, given your well known and immense knowledge of disarmament issues coupled with your long diplomatic skills, you will steer our deliberations to a successful conclusion. I also welcome the election of our equally experienced other members of the bureau. 
Mr. Chairman, 
It is the hope of my delegation that all the outstanding issues in our implementation of the NPT will, at this First Review Conference be resolved to ensure that the faith in the international community has in the Treaty is reaffirmed. While individual countries such as my own, Zambia, are committed to the preamble and articles of the Treaty, there is great concern that the package at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference has not been fulfilled by the nuclear Weapon States. This is very regrettable and a betrayal of confidence, to say the least. 
The lack of progress in this regard will only serve to undermine this important Treaty, which is a pillar of the non-proliferation regime. The Treaty is essential to international peace and security, as the NPT plays a crucial role in not only nonproliferation, and nuclear disarmament, but most importantly, in the promotion of . the peaceful uses energy, on which a large number of countries gathered here, depend. 
My delegation would, therefore, like this Conference to address the reluctance by the Nuclear Weapon Power States to undertake their commitment to fully implement the package that was endorsed at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. At that Conference, all of us State Parties committed ourselves to strengthening the Review process of the Treaty. We took very important decisions on principles and objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. These decisions included the extension of the Treaty on the NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and of course, the full implementation of the resolution on the Middle East that we adopted at the same Review and Extension Conference. 
Mr. Chairman, 
My delegation appreciates the difficulties encountered in the entire preparatory process of this Conference. We hope this Conference will, therefore, set an agenda for non-proliferation in the new millennium. In this regard, Zambia notes with satisfaction that at the Third Preparatory Session for this Conference, there was discussion and consideration of the proposals regarding the provision in Article VI of the NPT and in paragraph 3 and 4(c) of the 1995 decision on principles and objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. I appeal to this Conference to establish a subsidiary body to Main Committee I, of the Conference, which should deliberate on practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate all nuclear weapons. A second subsidiary body should be created to Main Committee II to consider and make recommendations for proposals on the implementation of the resolution in the Middle East. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Zambia is concerned that five years after the indefinite extension of the NPT, undue restrictions on exports of materials, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes to developing countries still persist. In this regard, my delegation would like to underscore the fact that this is a violation of the commitments made at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference. My delegation would further like to appeal to all those States concerned to ensure that their expressed concerns of perceived proliferation should not be used to justify any form of restriction on exports to non-nuclear weapons States of material, equipment and technology to facilitate the full exploitation of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
In this regard, the Zambian delegation would like to request this Conference to ensure that proliferation concerns are properly addressed through appropriate multilateral fora. To be more effective, all non-proliferation control arrangements should be transparent and open to participation by all States. In recent years, my Government has observed with deep concern the attempts by some members of the NPT regime, to use the International Atomic Energy Agency's Technical Cooperation Programme as a tool for political purposes in clear violation of the Agency's statutes. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The Conference should reaffirm the legitimate vote of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) to pursue nuclear disarmament on the basis of the Model Protocol Additional of May 1997. My delegation firmly believes that such a move would further strengthen the existing safeguards agreement. In this way, this August Conference would contribute in a more meaningful way, to the moral responsibility of our countries to implement the commitments made at the Review and Extension Conference, the very first time that Sovereign States agreed to freely give up their aspirations to possess a whole category of weapon systems in the interest of peace. 
In conclusion, my delegation reaffirms its total commitment to fulfill the requirements under the Treaty. In the same vein, the Nuclear Weapons States should fulfill their part of the obligations under Chapter VI by reaffirming their unequivocal commitment to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons. My delegation believes that such a move would strengthen our declared commitment to achieve general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
