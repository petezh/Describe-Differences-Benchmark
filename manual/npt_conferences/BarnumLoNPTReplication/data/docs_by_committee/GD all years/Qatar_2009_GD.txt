Mr. President,
I congratulate you for your election as Chairman of the third Preparatory Meeting for the 2010 Review Conference on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. I also congratulate the other members of the Bureau, and wish you all the success in leading our work towards achieving concrete and positive results this year. Likewise, we hope that a consensus will emerge that will breath new life into our work, which did not bring the desired results during the two previous meetings. We stress our full support in achieving consensus in the work of this important preparatory meeting. I would like, also, to commend the efforts of the Secretary General and the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, whom I thank for his statement. I associate the voice of my delegation with the statement by the Permanent Representative of Cuba on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement members of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as the Representative of the United Arab Emirates on behalf of the Group of Arab States.
Mr. President,
I associate my voice with the previous speakers in calling on all Member States of the Committee to comply with their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation, as well as to intensify international consultations in order to contribute to strengthening a global environment conducive to security and stability.
Mr. President,
The issue of nuclear disarmament is the top priority of the global agenda for disarmament, Yet as we get closer to the Review Conference of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation, to be held next year, the progress is still slow in this regard, since some of the five nuclear-weapon States refuse to implement the most important provisions of the Treaty, namely to reduce and to stop the development of nuclear arsenals, and other nuclear countries are not part of the Treaty. We also witnessed the conclusion of agreements outside the framework of the Treaty. We call for the review process to be conducted in light of the resolutions and decisions already taken during the two previous preparatory conferences, to benefit from this third preparatory conference, and that all States take practical and sincere steps in this regard. We emphasize that the final disposal of nuclear weapons is the basic requirement which can not be waived, for it is simply one of the pillars of the NPT. In the meantime, we must urgently reach a binding international instrument to protect non-nuclear-weapon States against the use of nuclear weapons or the threat of using them.
The State of Qatar is keen to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and activate its pillars, namely non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In this regard, we emphasize the inviolability of the inalienable right of States Parties to access nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, and the unhindered right of non-nuclear States Parties to the Treaty to develop nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes. The State of Qatar supports the early implementation of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. These principles have been emphasized in the Declaration of the Doha Arab Summit held on March 30th of this year.
It is necessary to activate the resolution on the establishment of nuclear-weapons-free-zone and weapons of mass destruction-free-zone in the Middle East, which was
adopted in 1995 in exchange for the indefinite extension of the NPT and the accession of all Arab States to the Treaty. This resolution was confirmed by the resolution of the Review Conference in 2000, and re-emphasized in the Doha Declaration of the 21st Arab Summit Conference. It is imperative that States Parties of the Treaty, in particular the three nuclear-weapon States that have adopted the resolution, break their silence towards Israel's nuclear policy that violates the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, brings the region into an arms race and endangers the regional and international security. The resolution of the Arab Summit held in Doha last March, which was sent to the Security Council and issued as an official document, emphasized that Arab countries will move in the context of alternatives in light of the responses of the 2010 Conference Review and the international community to the Arab demand of making the Middle East a nuclear-weapons-free-zone, and will review those alternatives at the Arab Summit in 2011. The accession of Israel to the Treaty on Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will enhance the confidence needed to find solutions to the many problems of the Middle East.
Mr. President,
We regret that, during the work of Disarmament Commission last month, we were not able to make progress on the item related to the recommendations for achieving the goal of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, due to double standards and discriminatory policies.
Mr. President,
The State of Qatar is consistently and continuously striving to strengthen the NPT and its enforcement. In this respect, it has participated in all conferences and supported all the relevant resolutions. It also submits objective reports in the field of nuclear disarmament and international security to the Office for Disarmament Affairs with the view to contributing to the preparation of the annual reports of the Secretariat of the United Nations, in compliance with the resolutions of the General Assembly on nuclear issues.
With regard to the national level, last January the State of Qatar signed the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and the Small Quantities Protocol with the IAEA. In terms of the national mechanism, the task of monitoring the implementation of the Convention is entrusted to a Committee that was established for that purpose in 2004, which comprises representatives from relevant state bodies. Similarly, the State of Qatar hosts workshops and events geared towards enhancing the training and the involvement of technical experts in the enforcement of international instruments on the prohibition of weapons of all kinds, including nuclear weapons, the suppression of nuclear terrorism and the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. One of these workshops was organized in cooperation with the Security Council of the United Nations. The State of Qatar enacts the necessary national legislation with the view to complying with its obligations in the area of disarmament and international security. It also trains senior national professionals and raises media-driven-awareness geared towards enforcement and verification.
Thank you.
