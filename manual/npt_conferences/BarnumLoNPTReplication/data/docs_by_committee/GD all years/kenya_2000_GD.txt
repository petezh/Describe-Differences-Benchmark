
Mr. President,
Allow me first of all to congratulate you on assuming this important post of president of the 2000 Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference and to wish you every success in discharging your noble task. May I also assure you of my delegations full support and cooperation.
Kenya has continuously and vigorously pursued an active policy of Nuclear non-proliferation, and has promoted the goal of complete Nuclear disarmament and elimination of such weapons. Consequently, we were among the first countries to sign the NPT when it was opened for signature in 1968. We proceeded to be among the first to ratify it in 1970, in the conviction that the treaty would play an important role in containing nuclear proliferation. In addition, Kenya is signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and, one of the first 21 members of the Conference on Disarmament. Kenya's credentials in this field are therefore, unquestionable. Indeed, it was on that historical basis that we lent our unswerving support to the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 and that we remain committed to it as an indispensable component of the global proliferation regime, as well as, an essential foundation for the pursuit of Nuclear disarmament.
Mr. President,
Thirty years after the Treaty came into force, and five years after its indefinite extension, it is of great concern to our delegation that progress has not been made in many areas. Indeed the easing of international tension and the strengthening of trust between states which came about as a result of the end of the cold war, and was expected to facilitate nuclear disarmament has had the contrary effect in some cases, with the Nuclear Weapon States (NWS) having reneged on many of their commitments under the NPT. The non-ratification of the CTBT by the US senate, nuclear testing in south Asia, the lack of effective international arrangements on negative security assurances are all examples of or consequences of the lack of political will by states to fulfill their obligations.
All these activities and omissions contribute to an erosion of the non-proliferation regime and threaten our collective security. In that regard, on June 6, 1998 at the Security Council's Meeting held to discuss the testing in South Asia, Kenya expressed its regret that the insecurity created by the lack of commitment by nuclear weapon states to move towards nuclear disarmament, had provided others who may have felt the need to ensure their own security, with an excuse to test. Deplorable though the actions by India and Pakistan maybe, a wake-up call had most definitely been sounded and we hope it was heard clearly enough.
Mr. President,
It is also disappointing that posturing by some at the Conference on Disarmament (CD) has turned it into a moribund body. Delegations are summoned to meetings only to be told that no progress has been made on its draft agenda. Discussions must start sooner rather than later on a Fissile Material cut-off treaty, which we hope will help salvage the non-proliferation regime and convince others of our seriousness of intent. We expect the Nuclear Weapon States to take seriously their responsibility of working towards nuclear disarmament, and to start the ball rolling at the CD in Geneva.
Mr. President,
While we note the unilateral and bilateral efforts aimed at the reduction of inter-continental Ballistic Missiles, we call upon all Nuclear States to move towards the total elimination of all weapons of mass destruction. Having said that we commend the recent decisions of the Russian Duma on the CTBT and START II. We hope these steps will bring about a wind of change in the nuclear disarmament field and encourage the ratification of the CTBT by the 44 states identified in it. As well as open up the possibility of negotiations on START III.
Mr. President,
I will now briefly address some issues of particular importance to Kenya. Key among them is the need for universal adherence to the NPT. We are frankly disappointed that the NPT has not achieved universality. It is imperative, in our view, that states which posses nuclear weapons or capability should all be parties to the Treaty, so that they can be subject to the IDEA regime. Conversely, States which have opted not to join our club should not benefit from the transfer of technology for peaceful uses which was intended only for Member States.
The question of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is of great significance to us. The realization that the benefits of nuclear energy can be harnessed by those of us who continue to grapple with energy deficiencies that cripple our economies is slowly gaining currency. At present, we are still considering safety and cost issues including, the possibility of regional and sub-regional approaches to our energy and medical needs.
We therefore agree that access to nuclear technology by all state parties should be on an assured and predictable basis. In that regard, the IAEA should be enabled to extend technical assistance without any constraints.
Mr. President,
The success of the review Conference will depend entirely on whether we believe that the NPT with its principles and objectives is still relevant in its current form or whether the changes that have taken place since its extension, and the clear lack of progress on
commitments undertaken demand a new reasoning. In our opinion, the review process should rededicate itself to realizing the objectives of the NPT and its principles and design a forward looking and more implementable programme.
For Instance, it appears to us that the need of security assurances for non nuclear weapon states has the support of most members of the international community yet it still shamefully evades us. We wish to recall that the General Assembly has consistently maintained that there is an urgent need to reach an early agreement on effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear weapons states against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. Such arrangements would best be in the form of an international convention of a legally binding character. In this regard, the General Assembly has appealed to all States, especially the nuclear-weapon States, to work actively towards an early agreement on a common approach and formula that could be included in an international instrument. We also hold that such assurances would encourage those outside the NPT process to consider joining it.
Mr. President,
The dumping of radioactive waste in the developing world and particularly in Africa that we witnessed in the 1980's seems to be recurring. Now and again we hear of dumping having occurred in Africa. In some cases the countries involved exploit the poverty rampant in some of these countries to lure accomplices from among their nationals. The impunity with which these immoral and criminal activities take place defy minimum human decency. Especially, if one takes into account that the poverty stricken victims of these adventures have not had the good fortune to enjoy the benefits of nuclear technology nor possess the know-how to handle its waste.
We are today therefore, appealing to all states that generate such waste to act responsibly in dealing with it, not to abet its dumping in Africa, but rather to sound the alarm when they know of intended illegal movements of such waste.
Mr. President,
In conclusion, Kenya once again expresses its hope that the review Conference will have a substantive outcome which will ensure that the decisions made earlier are implemented and a way forward developed for the decisions that we must make during this session.
Thank you.
