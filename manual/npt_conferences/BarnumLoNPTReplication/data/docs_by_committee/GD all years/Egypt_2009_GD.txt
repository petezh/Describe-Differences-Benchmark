Mr. Chairman
At the outset allow me to congratulate you on your election as Chairman of the Third Preparatory Committee to the 2010 NPT Review Conference, and to assure you of the Egyptian delegation's full support towards the successful outcome of the current review cycle. My delegation fully associates itself with the statements by the Non-Aligned Movement, the New Agenda Coalition, the African Group, and the Arab Group,
The 2010 Review Conference will convene in the context of severe challenges facing the NPT and its credibility, foremost amongst them the continued existence of thousands of nuclear weapons within as well as outside the legal framework of the NPT. This puts into question the viability of the NPT as the cornerstone of a global legal regime providing security to states party. In this context, the Third Preparatory Committee has a pivotal responsibility in preparing substantive recommendations to be adopted by the Review Conference that reflect the utmost priority of re-establishing the balance in the implementation of the Treaty as well as adopting necessary practical steps towards the fulfillment, within a specified timeframe, of the obligations of states party under the Treaty and the outcomes of previous review conferences, particularly those of 1995 and 2000, Fulfillment of these obligations requires the speedy achievement of NPT universality, particularly in the Middle East, a region whose peoples' and states' security is subjected to an increasing nuclear threat that requires immediate and balanced actions focusing simultaneously on disarmament and non proliferation, thereby preventing regional developments that may lead to the disintegration of the treaty and the non-proliferation regime,
Mr., Chairman
Egypt believes that the complete elimination of nuclear' weapons, which represents the primary objective of the Treaty, represents the only guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. This objective is dependent upon the implementation by the Nuclear Weapon States of their obligations under Article VI and the achievement of universal adherence to the Treaty.
While Egypt welcomes recent declarations by some nuclear weapon states of their renewed commitment to the objective of a world free of nuclear weapons, it considers that such declarations in themselves do not suffice to protect the Treaty, specially with the continued discrepancy between words and deeds. The continued possession by nuclear weapon states of nuclear' arsenals for deterrence purposes, the development of new generations of such weapons and the provision of assistance to states not party to the treaty thus perpetuating their non adherence, as well as the continued deployment of nuclear weapons in territories of non nuclear weapon states through nuclear sharing arrangements of military alliances, undermines the objectives of the treaty, and the presumed equality, irrespective of membership in military alliances, among the non nuclear weapon states,
Egypt considers that the Preparatory Committee must recognize that nuclear disarmament which r epresents the core objective of the treaty has not been achieved. Emerging trends stressing the importance of nuclear disarmament require the elaboration of concrete time-bound measures capable of ensuring immediate and tangible progress towards general and complete nuclear disarmament by building upon the 13 practical steps adopted by the 2000 Review Conference,
In this context, Egypt looks positively at efforts made with the aim of reviving the Conference on Disarmament, and is hopeful that such efforts will lead to agreement on a balanced and comprehensive program of work that includes negotiations on an effectively and internationally verifiable treaty on weapons usable fissile materials in accordance with the Shannon mandate.
The present review cycle must also aim to conclude, at the earliest possible time and within the NPT context, global, effective, non-discriminatory and unconditional legally-binding arrangements to assure non-nuclear weapon States parties to the NPT against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, Egypt, along with its New Agenda Coalition partners, has presented proposals in this regard.
Mr, Chairman,
Despite the adherence of the States of the Middle East to the NPT , their rejection of the nuclear weapon option in accordance with the Treaty, as well as their efforts to establish a Middle East nuclear weapon free zone, the rejection by Israel of any commitments and its continued involvement in non-peaceful nuclear activities outside the scope of the NPT, subjects the region to a real threat of a nuclear arms race thereby endangering the Treaty's viability and its purpose of achieving regional peace and security.
In that context, the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East constituted a pivotal cornerstone for the acceptance of the indefinite extension of the Treaty by Arab States . With 14 years having elapsed since the adoption of the Resolution, and without any practical steps taken so far towards its implementation, our peoples are questioning the utility of the extension of a treaty that has, until now, not provided them with security, It has not lead to Israel's accession to the Treaty as a Non-Nuclear Weapon State, nor to the placement of its nuclear facilities under IAEA comprehensive safeguards or to the establishment of a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East, Such concerns related to the non-implementation of the Resolution are compounded by the support extended by some Nuclear Weapon States to States not Party to the Treaty. This only increases the doubts of our peoples in so far as such discriminatory treatment may be extended to Israel in the future in a manner that would further undermine the credibility and viability of the Treaty, All this places an additional responsibility upon the States Party to the Treaty, in particular the three depository states, which proposed and sponsored the Middle East
Resolution as a means of addressing the concerns of Arab states at the time of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference. The depository states continue to bear the responsibility for the full implementation of the resolution, thereby preventing the further erosion of the treaty,
I wish to reaffirm here that the Arab commitment to achieve regional peace and security that governed their responsible position in accepting the indefinite extension of the Treaty within a package that comprised the Middle East Resolution was among the principal elements upon which the Arab Peace Initiative, launched at the 2002 Arab Summit and reaffirmed most recently in 2009, was based. There is no doubt that Israel's refusal of that proposal and the rejection of the current Israeli government of the two state solution unless other regional issues are resolved, and the refusal by Israel to accede to the Treaty or submit their nuclear facilities to IAEA Comprehensive Safeguards constitute the main obstacle to achieving regional peace and security. While Israel unjustifiably claims the existence of Arab threats, it is the Arab States, which have accepted the international legitimacy represented by the NPT, that have real security concerns in relation to Israel's nuclear program. Such concerns were reinforced by recent statements made by Israeli officials both in the present and the previous governments. Therefore, Egypt underscores that addressing global concerns related to regional non proliferation issues is intrinsically linked to the implementation of the Middle East Resolution and to the achievement of equality in the rights and obligations of all States of the region, without exception
Mr. Chairman,
Egypt attributes utmost importance to the promotion of the use by non nuclear weapon states party to the Treaty of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, thus enabling them to overcome increasing developmental and environmental challenges including increasing energy and food costs, This requires states party to exercise their obligations under the Treaty to facilitate access by non nuclear weapon states to nuclear technology and materials in the context of implementing their national development strategies and programs for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. At the same time, Egypt notes with growing concern attempts by some to reinterpret Article IV of the Treaty in a manner that aims to restrict the ability of non-nuclear weapon states to benefit from their rights by creating artificial categories of "sensitive" and "non-sensitive" nuclear technologies or "responsible" and "irresponsible" states. Egypt also views with concern efforts by the Nuclear Suppliers Group and other discriminatory arrangements to impose additional restrictions on some but not on others, in a manner that is clearly politicized and does not contribute to the implementation of the NPT's objectives, in particular1 its universality, as well as interference in the internal affairs of states by attempting to influence the determination of their nuclear energy requirements or to restrict their choice to achieve self-sufficiency in the area of fuel supply
Egypt believes that IAEA comprehensive safeguards agreements constitutes the legal and practical framework that ensures the peaceful nature of the uses by States Party of nuclear energy, and prevents their spread to non-state actors. It is therefore imperative to ensure that the exercise by States Party of their rights under the Treaty and the international support provided to them in this context is not subjected to additional restrictions and obligations that renders the continued non-adherence to the treaty, or withdrawal from it, a preferential status that can only lead to an undermined treaty and non-proliferation regime.
Mr. Chairman,
The above clearly demonstrates that the NPT is in dire need of a comprehensive review in order to reestablish its credibility and enhance its efficiency as the foundation of a truly global nuclear non proliferation regime, thereby restoring the balance between disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Such a review should allow for a common vision for dealing with past failures and bringing about a better future. Egypt attaches great importance to the adoption, by consensus, of a comprehensive review outcome document by the 2010 review conference that reaffirms the international political commitment by nuclear and non-nuclear weapon states alike, and the adoption of a time bound plan of action to implement the Treaty and the 1995 extension package, including the Resolution on the Middle East, paving the way for a cooperative endeavor to achieve our common interest in a world free from nuclear weapons and their threat to the safety and security of humanity,
Thank you, Mr, Chairman,
