At the outset please allow me to join the previous speakers in their congratulations on your election as the chair of 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Confident that under your leadership the Conference will come to a successful conclusion, I would like to reassure you of the full support of Montenegrin delegation.
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentleman,
We are gathered here with the aim to strengthen the implementation of all the provisions of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to reaffirm our commitment to its goals and to declare new pledges for achieving a more secure world. Today we are witnesses of a new momentum in the international relations regarding arms control and disarmament. In the field of conventional weapons we have the proposal for concluding an arms trade treaty, forthcoming UN Conference on SALW and various other initiatives. With regard to the weapons of mass destruction there is a raise of awareness of the necessity to renovate multilateral efforts and reactivate multilateral instruments and to engage in bilateral negotiations as well. Speaking of the threats which we are facing these days, the international community has reached a common understanding that terrorism represents a truly global problem, as it does not respect any geopolitical borders. Responsibility for managing threats to international peace and security must be shared among the nations and should be tackled on a multilateral basis.
Mr. President,
Montenegro fully aligns itself with the statement made by Ms. Catherine Ashton, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on behalf of the European Union. It is my great honour and privilege to address you today on behalf of the Government of Montenegro and to point out the issues of special importance for my country.
Mr. President,
Although Montenegro is the youngest member of the UN, we have passed a long way since 28 June 2006, date upon we became a member of the World Organization. After renewal of its independence Montenegro has taken necessary steps to renew its membership in the organizations and treaties which have as an objective enhancement of international peace and security.
In accordance with the Article VI of the NPT, Nuclear Weapon States are conducting various steps and reaching agreements in the field of nuclear disarmament and we praise them for that. It is important to seize the moment and willingness of the states to engage themselves in negotiations which fall under the mandate of the Conference on Disarmament, at the first place negotiations on the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty.Bearing in mind that disarmament and security issues represent responsibility of all states, Montenegro is aware of the importance of the activities that are undertaken in order to promote and advocate an early entry into force of CTBT. As a contracting party to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, Montenegro advocates its expeditious entry into force, welcomes the ratification of CTBT by three States in 2009 and the annunciation of the USA ratification. We are confident that only multilateral approach to security issues can contribute to the establishment of long-term peace and stability. Putting an emphasis on universality of international provisions on disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction derives from the fact that even small states that do not possess nuclear capacities or industry which is under CWC or BTWC regime, are part of the security architecture that aims at controlling the use of sensitive materials for peaceful purposes.
Mr. President,
Contemporary threats require wide cooperation between States at all levels as well as individual efforts for the prevention of the proliferation in all its aspects. We are committed to further strengthen our national security system and to contribute to the international mechanisms and cooperation in preventing illicit trafficking of nuclear and radioactive materials. Montenegro takes part in numerous non-proliferation projects, programmes and other initiatives for countering terrorism and prevention of acquisition of WMD by the terrorist groups.
It is our understanding that prevention of terrorist attacks seeks a comprehensive approach for tackling phenomenon known as terrorism. In this respect please allow me to quote former IAEA Director General Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei: "Without security, there can be no development - the reverse is also true. Improving life for the two billion people - one third of humanity - who live on less than $2 per day is not just the right thing to do morally; it is also the smart thing to do. By helping to address the root causes of instability and insecurity, including poverty, poor governance and endemic conflicts, we make it less likely that countries will feel the temptation to seek weapons of mass destruction. I am not suggesting that poverty, poor governance and conflict are the only factors which drive countries to seek nuclear weapons...But the factors I have mentioned are undoubtedly part of the problem and addressing them must be part of the solution."
Speaking of International Atomic Energy Agency and its role in non-proliferation field we call for the verification capabilities of the IAEA to be strengthened and expanded. Ratification and full implementation of the additional protocols to IAEA Safeguards Agreement should be accepted as a standard for verifying compliance with non-proliferation obligations deriving from NPT.
In connection to the non-proliferation obligations I would like to restate our support to diplomatic efforts for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and the solution of the Iranian nuclear issue, in a peaceful manner.
It should be noted that Montenegro has in a responsible manner approached to the development of institutional and legislative framework for verification and protection of nuclear and radiological material from misuse. Safeguards Agreement with Additional protocol and Protocol on Small Quantities were signed with IAEA in May 2008, and their ratification is planned by the end of this year, as well as the ratification of Amendment on Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. I am pleased to inform you that ratification process of the Joint Convention is finalized at the national level.
Mr. President,
As envisaged by the NPT potential benefits from any peaceful applications of nuclear explosions will be made available to non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treaty on a nondiscriminatory basis. Provided that a state complies with its non-proliferation obligations in good faith access to the benefits of peaceful use of nuclear energy cannot be denied. It is important to link the use of nuclear energy with nuclear non-proliferation, and this aim could be achieved by securing access for interested countries to the nuclear fuel cycle products and services through a multilateral mechanism.
It should be noted that even in this field we are witnessing renewed interest and actions towards defining different multilateral approaches towards securing access to the nuclear fuel cycle products and services and stakeholders, including developing countries which launching nuclear energy projects, should be encouraged to fully take part in this process.
Finally, I would like to reiterate commitment of Montenegro towards common goal of building peace and security and reaffirms our strong support for the Treaty as well as to welcome all the multilateral efforts to strengthen it.
Thank you!
