At the outset, my delegation would like to join others in congratulating you on your election to this important post of President of the 2010 NPT Review Conference and sincerely wish you success in the discharge of your duties. With your wealth of experience in multilateral diplomacy, my delegation is confident that this conference will come up with mutually acceptable decisions that strengthen the implementation of the NPT as well as preserve its integrity. In this regard, you and your bureau can count on the full support and cooperation of the Zimbabwe delegation.
My delegation associates itself with the statement made by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.
Mr. President,
Zimbabwe believes that the NPT remains the cornerstone of the international regime for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. It is therefore important that this review conference strives to preserve the integrity of the Treaty. We are meeting at this conference not only to take stock of what has been achieved in the past, but also to critically debate and adopt measures that strengthen the implementation of the treaty. Zimbabwe believes that the outcomes of this review conference should strengthen, without discrimination, the three pillars of the NPT, namely disarmament, non-proliferation and cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We are of the view that the selective implementation of the three pillars of the Treaty will not advance its objectives.
Mr. President,
This review Conference is taking place against the background of increased international focus on the need to eliminate nuclear weapons. We welcome recent positive developments in the field of disarmament and international security. Most notably, there is renewed commitment by nuclear weapon states to create a world free from nuclear weapons. The signing of the new START between the USA and Russia in April this year is also another positive gesture in global efforts to move forward nuclear disarmament. These positive developments notwithstanding, much more needs to be done to achieve nuclear disarmament. It is imperative that these positive steps be consolidated and built upon in order to move forward the ultimate goal of nuclear disarmament.
Mr. President,We note that despite the General Assembly adopting resolutions since 1946 that call for the elimination of nuclear weapons, these weapons remain in their thousands in the national armaments of nuclear weapons states yet they constitute the most destructive threat to both humanity and global security. Likewise, while the number of nuclear weapons might have decreased since the end of the Cold War, the quality, potential destructive power and precision of the remaining arsenals have increased as nuclear weapon states continue to modernize their nuclear weapons. We are concerned that despite the glaring dangers posed by nuclear weapons, some countries continue to maintain military doctrines that are based on the possession of nuclear weapons. In our view, such doctrines and actions by nuclear weapon states contradict the letter and spirit of the NPT and also constitute a major impediment to progress towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
Mr. President,
Given the lack of progress on nuclear disarmament, it is imperative that this review conference agree to clear action plans and a time frame for the implementation of Article VI by nuclear weapon states. The agreed action plans must be transparent, irreversible and verifiable. It is also imperative that nuclear weapon states also take concrete steps to implement the thirteen practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons, agreed to at the 2000 NPT Review Conference. The 2000 NPT Review Conference declaration put emphasis on "an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament."
Mr. President,
Pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons, there is urgent need for a universal, unconditional and legally binding instrument on security assurances to non-nuclear weapon states to the NPT. However, even though the provision of negative security assurance to non - nuclear weapon states gives some sort of security to them, the total elimination of nuclear weapons is still the only absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons.
Mr. President,
My delegation shares the view that the universality of the NPT is critical in the success of any nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation process. The existence of some states outside the NPT severely undermines the viability of the NPT. This review Conference should therefore work to achieve the universality of the NPT.
Mr. President,
Zimbabwe fully supports the establishment of nuclear weapon free zones in all the regions of the world as this constitutes an important measure in achieving nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. It is therefore regrettable that fifteen years after the adoption of the Middle East Resolution, the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the region has not yet been realized. Moreover, relevant General Assembly resolutions, IAEA General Conferences as well as Final Declarations of all NPT Review Conferences have stressed the urgent need for the creation of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East. It is therefore important that this review conference adopts practical action plans on the establishment of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East.
In this regard, Zimbabwe welcomes the entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty on 15 July 2009 and is proud to have to ratified it. Following the entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty, we call upon nuclear weapon states that have not yet ratified protocols to this Treaty to do so without delay and unconditionally. On this note, we welcome the announcement by the United States of its intention to put the Pelindaba Treaty before its Senate for ratification.
Mr. President,
Zimbabwe reaffirms that the promotion of the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes is an inalienable right of all states enshrined in Article IV of the NPT. It is also the main statutory objective of the IAEA. Any restrictions of this right that are outside the framework of the NPT constitutes a violation of the letter and spirit of the Treaty under Article IV. Zimbabwe believes that peaceful use of nuclear technology can be of tremendous benefit for African countries in their development efforts. We call for more international cooperation in promoting the use of nuclear energy for peaceful use.
Mr. President,
My delegation shares the view that raising awareness and educating the public on the tragic consequences of the use of nuclear weapons is important. Everyone needs to support the disarmament and non-proliferation agenda and to move it forward.
In conclusion, my delegation believes that this review Conference offers us an opportunity to master political will to work together constructively, and to share a common vision of how to strengthen the NPT for the betterment of both present and future generations. With this we hope that this review conference will come up with implementable, practical, pragmatic and realistic decisions that strengthen the integrity and implementation of the treaty. Let's make this 2010 NPT Review Conference a stepping stone for a strengthened NPT regime.
I thank you.
