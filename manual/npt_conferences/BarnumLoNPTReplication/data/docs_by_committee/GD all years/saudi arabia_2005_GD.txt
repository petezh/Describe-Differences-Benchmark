MR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES,
THE DELEGATION OF MY COUNTRY IS PLEASED TO CONVEY TO YOUR EXCELLENCY ITS CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ASSUMPTION OF THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF THIS IMPORTANT CONFERENCE, WHICH CONFIRMS YOUR PERSONAL STANDING AND YOUR COUNTRY'S IMPORTANCE. WE ARE CONFIDENT OF YOUR ABILITIES AND COMPETENCE TO DIRECT THE PROCEDINGS SUCCESSFULLY. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DISARMAMENT AFFAIRS IN ORGANIZING THIS MEETING.
DURING A PREVIOUS PREPARATORY MEETING IN GENEVA, THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA SUBMITTED A REPORT ABOUT THE STEPS THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN TO ESTABLISH A NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. IT WAS ISSUED IN AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENT (NPT/CONF.2005/PC. 11/30) IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRST PART OF THE FINAL DOCUMENT OF THE REVIEW CONFERENCE OF 2000. THE GOVERNMENT OF MY COUNTRY STILL ASSERTS ALL THE CONCERNS CONTAINED IN THAT REPORT, FOREMOST AMONG THEM IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NUCLEAR FREE-ZONE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THIS CONCERN WAS ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY SINCE 1974. IT HAS ACTUALLY BEEN ADOPTED BY CONSENSUS SINCE THE 35(tm) SESSION IN 1980. ON THE REGIONAL LEVEL, THE LEAGUE OF ARAB STATES HAS CONFIRMED THE SAME DIRECTION IN ITS RESOLUTION NO. 5380 DURING THE 101st SESSION OF 27 MARCH 1994. ACCORDING TO THIS RESOLUTION, A TECHNICAL COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED TO MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST A FREE ZONE FROM ALL WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, ESPECIALLY, NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
SINCE ACHIEVING PEACE AND SECURITY IS NOT MAINTAINED THROUGH POSSESSION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, BUT RATHER THROUGH COOPERATION AND DIALOGUE, AND THE ENDEAVOURS TO ACHIEVE DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESS AND AVOIDING THE RACE TO POSSESS THOSE DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS, WE SUBMIT THAT ISRAELI'S POSSESSION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO CREATE PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE REGION. THEREFORE, ALL ITS JUSTIFICATIONS FOR POSSESSION AND DEVELOPMENT OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, ESPECIALLY NUCLEAR WEAPONS, IS A CLEAR CONTRADICTION WITH ITS CLAIM FOR PEACE WITH THE COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES OF THE REGION. REAL PEACE MUST BE FOUNDED ON CONFIDENCE, TRUST AND GOOD INTENTIONS AMONG THE COUNTRIES AND PEOPLES OF THE REGION; IT IS BASED ON FREEING THE REGION FROM INJUSTICE, OCCUPATION AND COMMITTING AGGRESSIVE CRIMES. FURTHERMORE, IT IS NOT BASED ON POSSESSION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION OR THE THREAT TO USE IT, OR THE POLICIES OF HEGEMONY AND ESTABLISHING FACTS ON THE GROUND. THESE POLICIES ARE NOT ONLY A SOURCE OF CONCERN AND A THREAT TO THE PEOPLES OF THE REGION, THEY ARE ALSO A THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY.
IN THIS REGARD, ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, MY COUNTRY HAS COOPERATED IN ITS EFFORTS TO ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY; IT SUBMITTED ITS REPORT AS STIPULATED IN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1540, REGARDING THE SPREAD OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. THE REPORT WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO PARAGRAPH 4 OF THE RESOLUTION IN DOCUMENT S/AC .44/2004/(02)/65. ALSO IN THIS REGARD, HIS EXCELLENCY, THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA SENT A LETTER TO ITS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TO THE IAEA, ON 09 MARCH 2005 ATTACHED TO AN AUTHORIZATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA TO SIGN THE COMPREHENSIVE SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENTS AND THE SMALL QUANTITIES PROTOCOL.
MR. PRESIDENT,
MY GOVERNMENT IS FOLLOWING THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND IRAN CONCERNING ITS ATOMIC PROGRAM, WHICH IS FACING SOME HURDLES AND IS CAUSING SOME CONCERN. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENCOURAGE THE IRANIAN SIDE TO CONTINUE ITS COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY TO MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST A WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION FREE ZONE. THIS CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH COOPERATION AND TRANSPARENCY. MY GOVERNMENT IS HOPEFUL THAT IRAN WILL CONTINUE ITS CONSTRUCTIVE COOPERATION. CONTINUING THESE
COOPERATIVE EFFORTS WILL REPRESENT A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO ACHIEVE PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE REGION, WHICH IS PART OF SECURITY AND STABILITY IN THE REGION.
MR. PRESIDENT,
PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE REGION CANNOT BE ACHIEVED WHEN SOME COUNTRIES IN THE REGION POSSESS DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS. RATHER, IT WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH COOPERATION, UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT FOR THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS; BY CEASING THE POLICY OF HEGEMONY AND SELF-INTEREST INSTEAD OF COMMON AND SHARED INTERESTS.
IN CONCLUSION, THE GOVERNMENT OF MY COUNTRY REITERATES THAT NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT IS THE ONLY GUARANTEE FOR NOT USING OR THREATENING TO USE THEM. THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA BELIEVES THAT THE FEARS OF MANY COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT POSSESS NUCLEAR WEAPONS SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN LIGHT OF THE CONTINUING INSTABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, IN ADDITION TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGION. THIS COULD BE ACHIEVED BY DEVELOPING AN INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENT THAT GUARANTEES THE SECURITY AND STABILITY OF THE STATES THAT DO NOT POSSESS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
