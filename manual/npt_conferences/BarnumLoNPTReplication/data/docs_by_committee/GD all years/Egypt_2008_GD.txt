Mr. Chairman,
Allow me at the outset to express to you my congratulations on your appointment as Chairman of the Second Preparatory Committee of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. My delegation stands ready to extend to you and all States Parties our utmost cooperation to ensure the success of this Committee.
Mr. Chairman,
Since its entry into force in 1970 the NPT has undoubtedly become the cornerstone of global efforts in achieving nuclear disarmament and dealing with challenges pertaining to non-proliferation. In addition it provided a secure and effective framework to ensure the access of all States Parties, without exception or discrimination, to the benefits derived from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. An honest assessment of the effectiveness and competence of the Treaty in achieving its declared objectives must be based on the degree to which States Parties have diligently complied with the provisions of the Treaty as regards its three fundamental pillars.
Our main objectives during this Review Cycle will be to focus on the implementation of the three fundamental and interdependent pillars of the Treaty. This should be done in a balanced and objective manner. We must also work on formulating practical and effective measures to address the challenges faced by the Treaty. Primary amongst those is achieving NPT Universality and determining the most appropriate means through which to implement the various outcomes of previous Review Conferences. It is important to highlight the role of the Preparatory Committee, pursuant to Para 4 of Decision I on Strengthening the Review Process of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, in fortifying the pillars of the Treaty through pursuing the diligent implementation of all its Provisions, as well as the Three Decisions and Resolution of 1995. These have become part and parcel of the Review Process. It is not however within the competence of the Review Process to attempt to reinterpret or reformulate the Provisions of the Treaty or to amend any of its existing Articles.
Mr. Chairman,
Egypt stands ready to extend its utmost cooperation to ensure the success of this Review Process. In this regard we will be submitting Working Papers that contain practical measures and ideas that may contribute in addressing the challenges that face the Treaty and enhance the chances for the success of this Review Process.
Mr. Chairman,
Egypt welcomes the reductions made by the Nuclear Weapon States in their nuclear arsenals. We consider this as a positive step towards compliance with Article VI of the Treaty and with Decision II on Principles and Objectives of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference and the 13 practical steps achieved by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference. We reiterate however that such reductions do not as yet meet the expectations of the vast majority of States Parties. This is especially the case in light of qualitative developments undertaken in nuclear arsenals, which reaffirm that Nuclear Weapon States continue to rely on nuclear deterrence as a salient feature in their strategic security policies. This situation casts serious doubts on
commitments to nuclear disarmament and the implementation of Article VI and thus disrupts the delicate balance upon which the Treaty is based. In addition it enhances the risks associated with emphasizing the value of nuclear weapons in achieving security and thus increases the potential of the proliferation of those weapons.
The threat posed by nuclear weapons only strengthens calls for the conclusion at an early date of a multilateral agreement on effective legally binding international arrangements to assure Non-Nuclear Weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, pursuant to Para 8 of Decision II of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. It is unjustifiable for Nuclear Weapon States to continue maintaining nuclear military postures towards Non-Nuclear Weapon States that are in compliance with their Treaty obligations. Both Nuclear and Non-Nuclear Weapon States are bound by the same Treaty and thus should equally benefit from the security it is designed to provide.
Mr. Chairman,
Perhaps the greatest challenge facing the NPT is achieving its universality, as it constitutes a necessary precondition for the creation of a nuclear weapon free world. From that perspective, and pursuant to Para 1 of Decision II of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, we call upon all States Parties, particularly the Five Nuclear Weapon States - in the context of their primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council and by virtue of their special responsibilities in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations - to redouble their efforts to achieve this goal through adopting a series of specific, practical and effective measures in that regard. This will help dispel the prevailing perception, supported by several indicators that current international events and policies contribute towards cementing the present status quo, thereby contravening the spirit and provisions of the Treaty, in a manner that detracts from its credibility. It is noteworthy that efforts to realize Treaty Universality have thus far not been commensurate with the recognition by all States Parties of the pivotal role that the NPT plays in enhancing International Peace and Security.
In this context the Review Cycle must redouble its efforts to formulate suggestions on practical measures which may contribute towards achieving NPT Universality. We are at a juncture that does not leave much room for hollow statements of support to the Principles and Objectives of the Treaty. Continuing on such a path of self deception, without laying a concrete and practical foundation, is an exercise in futility, and a dangerous course that threatens the collapse of the Treaty under the pressures exerted by the many challenges it faces.
Furthermore we reiterate that the priority of achieving NPT Universality is a necessary first step towards the universal application and strengthening of IAEA Full Scope Safeguards. Any efforts to the contrary disrupt the delicate regional and international balances in place, especially in the Middle East. Egypt rejects any attempts to impose additional obligations on Non-Nuclear Weapon States, which are already in compliance with their commitments pursuant to the Treaty, if they are not reciprocated by equal and commensurate measures by states that still lie outside the Treaty and are not bound by Comprehensive Safeguard Agreements.
In this context Egypt underscores the dangers of engaging in nuclear cooperation between States Parties and other states not party to the Treaty, regardless of the motives declared or the intentions stated. Any such cooperation is in direct contradiction to the spirit of Article 1 of the Treaty and the provisions of Para 12 of Decision II of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension
Conference. Such actions raise serious concerns amongst Non-Nuclear Weapon States Parties as to the value added by remaining within the framework of the Treaty and consistently upholding and strengthening its Objectives. It is therefore necessary to reevaluate such forms of cooperation in view of their direct negative impact on the entire global non-proliferation regime.
Mr. Chairman,
The NPT constitutes the cornerstone of global efforts to ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. In this regard we reiterate the necessity for full and diligent compliance by all States Parties with the Provisions of the Treaty. We call for proactive and positive interaction between them within the appropriate and relevant international and legal frameworks that seek to address non-proliferation challenges, including the IAEA. Addressing such issues through unilateral measures only undermines the credibility of the NPT.
Mr. Chairman,
Non-Nuclear Weapon States Party to the Treaty have a right to the full enjoyment of the benefits of peaceful uses of nuclear energy pursuant to Article IV of the NPT. Furthermore, States Parties, particularly Nuclear-Weapon States, have an obligation to support the development of those capabilities in accordance with the Provisions of the Treaty and within the framework of Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements concluded with the IAEA. In addition, Paras 14,15 and 16 of Decision II of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference reaffirm this Principle. Para 16 in particular notes the special needs of developing states and highlights the necessity of affording them preferential treatment. This is of particular importance when evaluated in relation to the environmental and developmental challenges that the vast majority of humanity currently faces, and the scarcity of energy sources.
Egypt reaffirms its support of this inalienable right as guaranteed by Article IV of the Treaty. It is for States Parties to enjoy such rights without the imposition of restrictions extraneous to those explicitly contained in the Articles of the Treaty. In that context we wish to highlight the importance of exerting efforts towards realizing the full transparency of nuclear supply arrangements, and transforming them into an inclusive multilateral and non-discriminatory framework through the relevant and competent mechanisms of the United Nations, Until such time, such arrangements must comply with Para 12 of Decision II of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference in so far as requiring the acceptance of Full Scope IAEA Safeguards and internationally legally binding commitments not to acquire nuclear weapons as a necessary precondition for the transfer of such material to a state.
Mr. Chairman,
The Middle East Resolution is undoubtedly one of the most important outcomes of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference and constitutes an essential element of the consensus Package that also comprised Three Decisions. The full implementation of all elements of the Package, including the Resolution of the Middle East, is necessary in order to ensure its continued validity. Any shortcomings or reluctance in implementing any of its components negatively affects the necessarily integrated nature of the implementation of the remaining components of the Package.
The current tensions in the Middle East necessitates that all States of the region exert concerted efforts to ensure the elimination of nuclear weapons from the region, with a view to enhancing regional security and stability. Israel's continued refusal to accede to the NPT as a Non-Nuclear
Weapon State and place all of its nuclear facilities under IAEA Full Scope Safeguards, as well as its reluctance to take any positive steps towards the establishment of a Nuclear Weapons Free Zone in the Middle East only compounds the risks of regional nuclear weapons proliferation. The perpetuation of such an inequitable situation is unacceptable and untenable. The credibility of the Treaty amongst all States Parties of the region will be seriously compromised should a single state continue to remain exempt from its Provisions.
We reaffirm once again the necessity of dealing with this matter within the framework of the Treaty due to its direct relevance to the Provisions and Objectives of the NPT and in fulfillment of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference Middle East Resolution which reaffirmed the special status of the Middle East in the context of the Treaty. It is noteworthy that the 2000 Review Conference Final Document also highlighted that the Middle East Resolution remains valid until implemented.
Furthermore there is a strong relationship between the implementation of the Middle East Resolution and the achievement of NPT Universality, and consequently the preservation of International Peace and Security. From this perspective we call upon all States parties, particularly the Five Nuclear Weapon States Parties to the Treaty - in the context of their primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security as Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council and by virtue of their special responsibilities in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations - to exert every effort towards achieving this end. In this regard we encourage careful consideration of the practical proposals that will be contained in our Working Paper on ways and means to move forward towards implementing the Resolution on the Middle East, bearing in mind that those proposals are by no means exhaustive and that we stand ready to consider other measures that may be suggested with a view to achieving consensus on how best to implement this obligation. Reluctance, intransigence, double standards, or a refusal to shoulder responsibilities will however undoubtedly lead to negative consequences with dire repercussions on the effectiveness of the Treaty and its future.
Mr. Chairman,
In conclusion, Egypt reaffirms the importance of ensuring the commitment of the international community to the multilateral nature of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We reiterate our faith in the ability of the 2010 Review Conference to achieve positive steps towards NPT Universality and enhancing a balanced implementation of Treaty Provisions and the consensus outcomes of the 1995 and 2000 Conferences in such a way so as to ensure the realization of our common goals of Peace, Security and Stability.
Thank You.
