Let me begin by congratulating you on your election as President of the VIII NPT Review Conference, I also wish to extend congratulations to the other members of the Bureau. We are confident that given your experience and the dedication that you and your delegation assign to this issue, we will conclude this Conference achieving significant progress towards strengthening the Treaty.
We associate ourselves with the statement made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, on behalf of the Member States of the Non-Aligned Movement - Parties' to the NPT.
Mr. President,
The ongoing review of the Treaty is a timely. Certain circumstances have shown that it has become urgent and necessary to reaffirm the existence and validity of the rules it lays down, as well as the commitments we have been undertaking, particularly at the 1995 and 2000 Review Conferences.
The new challenges posed by the current historical juncture had generated divergent perceptions as to the steps to be taken. But we must not overlook that the Treaty was adopted as the cornerstone for disarmament, arms control and the peaceful prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We therefore have the duty to reconsider the way in which we have complied with its provisions, due credit being given to the progress achieved in previous Review Conferences.
Mr. President,
Guatemala promotes the universality of the NPT and the full observance of each and every one of its provisions. We underline its binding character and the need for all States to clearly demonstrate their adherence to the letter and spirit of this international legal instrument.
The respect and compliance of the Treaty and the outcomes of the past Review Conferences should be made in a comprehensive and orderly fashion. To that effect, we propose that this Conference should make progress in designing a mechanism to ensure the full compliance with the obligations of the so called three pillars: nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, which should encompass verification measures, and be based on objectiveness, transparency and accountability. Given the diversity of opinions that exists regarding the degree of compliance with the Treaty and the implementation of the agreements reached, we truly hope that we will not miss this opportunity to agree on specific recommendations on this issue.In building this compliance mechanism, the initiatives related to the elaboration of national reports and for a programme of action for nuclear disarmament are especially relevant. Additionally, the institutional changes that are being proposed will allow for a more deep and adequate evaluation of the challenges and opportunities before us.
Mr. President,
Now we need to find the means to strengthen actions for nuclear disarmament, which requires above all an expression of clear political will by the Nuclear-Weapon-States and a set of concrete, scheduled and verifiable actions that allow us to give up the rhetoric that seeks to force us to acknowledge progress even though nuclear weapons not only continue to exist in enormous quantities, but there are also attempts to refine them.
While noting some positive political signals coming from Nuclear-Weapons-States (NWS) of their renewed commitment with bilateral and multilateral nuclear disarmament we expect them to be turned into concrete actions in the near future. In this regard, we consider the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) between the United States and the Russian Federation as a step in the right direction. We also believe that the revised Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) recently announced by the United States is an important contribution to the process of reviewing the security doctrines related to nuclear weapons.
Mr. President,
We are not starting from scratch. We have, as a starting point, the thirteen practical steps adopted at the 2000 Review Conference, as measures to move towards nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. We now need to move this forward. Among the most important steps are the measures to be taken by nuclear weapon States. Also, we need to recognize, without any further delays, the urgent task to begin negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament (CD) of a Treaty to Ban the Production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices and an instrument of negative security assurances. On the other hand, it is essential to maintain the moratorium on nuclear-test explosions pending the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty (CTBT).
We are convinced that in carrying out these measures we should, to ensure that they produce the best possible results, bear constantly in mind that as progress must be made in nuclear disarmament, it is equally necessary in the area of non-proliferation, both endeavors being treated on an equal footing. Thus, the non-nuclear-weapon States are also obligated to fulfill their own responsibilities under the Treaty, reaffirming its commitment not to become nuclear weapon, but exercising their inalienable right to accede, develop and participate, in the future, in nuclear technology meant exclusively for peaceful purposes. Finally, it should be added that all these measures, as regards both disarmament and non-proliferation, must be conducted in an environment that favors verification and transparency, with the aim of restoring confidence between the Parties to the Treaty.
Hence, we underscore the role the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays in verifying that nuclear energy is being used exclusively for peaceful purposes. We are convinced that any restriction or limitation to the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes should be consistent with the NPT provisions and with the United Nations Charter. We stress the importance of non- proliferation agreements to be universal, transparent and non-discriminatory.
Mr President,
We would like to take this opportunity to renew our support for the Comprehensive Nuclear- Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which we signed on September 20, 1999, and that we wish to ratify promptly.
The Government of Guatemala is aware of the need to overcome the impasse in its process of ratification to this instrument and is undertaking actions to raise awareness among national institutions to this end.
On more than one occasion, we have informed the Preparatory Commission of the challenges faced by Guatemala in order to cancel the financial contributions originated before the ratification. We trust that this Conference will discuss and promote measures to resolve the financial difficulties faced by developing countries, like mine, that have the political will to ratify the treaty, but are held back for other reasons.
Guatemala wishes to take this opportunity to renew its commitment to undertake all possible efforts, in order to overcome the obstacles that have prevented its ratification to the Treaty in order to contribute to the ultimate goal of early entry into force of the CTBT.
Mr President,
Guatemala is proud to be part of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which established the first inhabited nuclear-weapon-free zone and has served as an example and inspiration for the creation of other such zones. A nuclear-weapon-free zone has thus been consolidated in Latin America and the Caribbean, which also seeks to ensure that this area is not at risk of a nuclear threat. For that reason, Guatemala joined the other States of the region, along with members of other Nuclear-weapon-free zones, in order to adopt a common policy vis-a-vis the nuclear-weapon States, in order to strengthen peace and security at regional and international level. We thus participated in the recent Second Conference of States Parties and Signatories to Treaties that Establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia, which was held in New York City, which became an important opportunity to continue working towards a world free of nuclear weapons and to renew our commitment to strengthen cooperation and consultation mechanisms between the zones. We support the Final Declaration emanating from this Conference and consider it as a positive contribution to this Review Conference.
We reiterate our support for the establishment, as a matter of urgency, of a NWFZ in the Middle East, in conformity with the Resolution on the Middle East, adopted at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, with a view to the realizing the universality of the Treaty in the Middle East, and in accordance with relevant United Nations General Assembly Resolutions. It is unfortunate that after fifteen years since the adoption of the Resolution, a central pillar of the decision to indefinitely extend the Treaty, it has not been implemented.
In closing, Mr. President, we wish to affirm that this Review Conference affords an opportunity for evaluating the will of all the parties to live up to their commitments and the expectations they have generated. We must not back away from these commitments. We should, rather, breathe new life into the unequivocal promises made in 2000 and rely on them to deal with the new menaces the treaty confronts. The strength, the credibility and the very existence of the Treaty are based on a fundamental bargain, one in which the undertaking that there will be no indefinite possession of nuclear weapons is balanced by the assurance that there will be no new nuclear-weapon States, the right to peacefully use nuclear energy being nevertheless safeguarded. It is on the basis of this bargain that all the States parties to the treaty should advance towards agreement of a common agenda to preserve international peace and security.
Thank you.
