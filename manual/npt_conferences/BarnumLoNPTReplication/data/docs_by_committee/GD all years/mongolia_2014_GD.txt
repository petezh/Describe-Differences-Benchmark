STATEMENT BY H.E.MR.OCH OD,
AMBASSADOR, PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF MONGOLIA
TO THE UNITED NATIONS,
at the General Debate
3rd session of the Preparatory Committee for the
2015 Review Conference of the State Parties to the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
28 April2014
Mr. Chairman,
My delegation congratulates you on your election to preside over this important
session and assures you of our full support and cooperation in achieving the
Committee's goals.
Mongolia welcomes positive developments and efforts pursued during the past
year in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The High-Level Meeting
of the UN General Assembly on Nuclear Disarmament held last September has
generated a momentum to urge meaningful steps for achievement of nuclear
disarmament goals as the highest global priority. My delegation welcomes the adoption
of the UNGA Resolution 68/32 on the follow-up to the High-Level meeting.
My government took note of other important initiatives and developments that
seek to address the security challenges of our times, including the Conference on
humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons held last February in Mexico, as well as the
Nuclear Security Summit held in Hague. We also note the Joint Statement on the P5
Beijing Conference: Enhancing Strategic Confidence and Working Together to
Implement the Nuclear-Non-Proliferation Review Outcome, which was issued on 15
April2014.
1 
The UN Secretary-General's five-point proposal, along with other crucial
initiatives on nuclear disarmament, quests for practical, systematic and progressive
nuclear disarmament efforts towards our ultimate goal - a world free of nuclear
weapons. In this regard, we are confident that establishment of 26 September as
International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapon will definitely promote
accountability for disarmament obligations and absolutely enhance public awareness
and education on the threat posed by nuclear weapons to humanity and necessity for
their total elimination.
Mr. Chairman,
All States Parties are required to be committed to universal adherence to the
Treaty. We believe that full and effective implementation of all provisions of the Treaty
and bonne fide follow-up of the decisions, resolutions, final documents and plans of
action of the 1995, 2000 and 2010 NPT Review Conferences are required to preserve
its relevance, credibility and effectiveness. We call on all remaining Annex 2 States to
speedily ratify the treaty to kickoff the CTBT. We urge the start of negotiations for an
FMCT. Needless to say that the NPT universal application is pending on the earliest
accession by States non-party to the Treaty.
My delegation shares the concerns over the lack of universality in the acceptance
of the IAEA comprehensive safeguards agreements and the Additional Protocol and
lack of progress in the implementation of the 1995 Middle-East resolution adopted
almost 20 years ago.
Mr. Chairman,
We strongly believe that the only solution against the use or threat of use of
nuclear weapons is their total elimination as ultimate goal.
Establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones has proven to be an effective
regional measure of non-proliferation and disarmament. Mongolia is pursuing its efforts
and contribution to this cause, through advancement of its NWF status and support of
nuclear-weapons-free zones. The existing zones need to be strengthened and
measures to be taken to promote the establishment of new zones, including in the
Middle East and in Northeast Asia.
Last September, during the High-Level Meeting of the UN General Assembly on
Nuclear Disarmament, the President of Mongolia proposed to undertake a second
2 
comprehensive study on the establishment NWFZs in all its aspects, so as to take stock
of the progress made since the first such study was undertaken by the United Nations in
1975 and chart the future course of action of effective support of NWFZs as practical
regional measures to promote the goals of a world without nuclear weapons. My
delegation looks forward to broader support of this the proposal.
Mr. Chairman,
Bearing in mind that every country could and should make its contribution to the
nuclear non-proliferation cause and promotion of the vision of a world free of nuclear
weapons, Mongolia has been vigorously pursuing its efforts to institutionalize the
Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status, declared over 20 years ago. The 2013 Future
Policy Award recognized Mongolia's policy as one of Honourable Mentions to additional
disarmament policies.
In January 2014 the Standing Committee on Security and Foreign Policy of the
State Great Hural (parliament) of Mongolia has set up a working group to assess and
monitor the implementation of the law on Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status, as
well as of Resolution 19 of the State Great Hural. The Working Group assessed the
progress on the implementation of the law and made concrete recommendations such
as to continue to closely cooperate with the five nuclear -weapon states, states parties to
NWFZ treaties and other states and international organizations to further strengthen
Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status. The detailed report of the Working Group has
been submitted to the UN Secretariat and will be issued as GA official document.
Mr. Chairman,
Allow me to conclude by calling upon all the States Parties to seize the
opportunity and make tangible progress towards comprehensive NPT implementation
and make 2015 a year when the momentum would be seized and substantial progress
made towards a world without nuclear weapons and threats.
Thank you.
