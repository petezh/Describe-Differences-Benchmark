Statement by the Delegation of the Kyrgyz Republic

First Session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2015 Review Conference
of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
Cluster 3 issues
(Vienna, 9 May 2012)
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for the opportunity to take the floor during the discussion of Cluster 3 issues. As
a member of the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, we attach special importance
to the emphasis the zone places on rehabilitation of territories affected by radioactive
contamination, especially those sites associated with uranium tailings.
This concern actually predates the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, and was
clearly expressed during the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference and subsequent
NPT Review Conferences and Preparatory Committee meetings. At these meetings, calls
were made for all governments and international organizations that have expertise in the
field of clean-up and disposal of radioactive contaminants to consider giving appropriate
assistance as may be requested for remedial purposes in affected areas.
Mr. Chairman, in light of the history of this issue in the NPT review process and the fact
that the problem of radioactive tailings in our country is trans-boundary in nature, we wish
to call to the attention of this Preparatory Committee meeting our plans to submit a draft
resolution on the subject of mitigating radiation threats in Central Asia at the next session
of the UN General Assembly. We would welcome input from the international community
as we develop the draft resolution.
Thank you.
