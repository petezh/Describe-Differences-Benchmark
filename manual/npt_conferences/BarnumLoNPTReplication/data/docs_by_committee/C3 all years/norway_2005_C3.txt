Madam Chair,
My delegation apologies for taking the floor for the second time. However, at this occasion we would like to introduce a working paper on combating the risk of nuclear terrorism by reducing the civilian use of highly-enriched uranium, on behalf of, in addition to my own, the Icelandic, the Lithuanian and the Swedish delegations.
The working paper has been submitted, but has yet to receive a formal number. Copies have been provided to the Secretariat in the back of this room. Madam Chair,
We recommend that this Conference Expresses the view that it is desirable to minimize the use of and commerce in highly enriched uranium, and establishes the goal of total elimination of highly-enriched uranium in the civilian nuclear sector - as soon as technically feasible. In light of the inherent risk related to the continued use of highly enriched uranium, we also encourage all countries to not support new projects involving HEU fuel. Madam Chair,
We are of the opinion that such a non-discriminatory approach might enjoy widespread support at
this Conference, we use the opportunity to thank the distinguished representatives of Austria and
Kirgizstan for their support of this initiative,
Madam Chair,
Thank you for the attention.
