Thank you Mr. Chairman,
First and foremost, my delegation fully associates itself with the statement of NAM States Parties to the NPT on this cluster of issues. My Delegation would, however, also wish to highlight (ne elements that we view as important under this cluster on peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Mr Chairman,
My delegation wishes to recall that Principle 19 of the Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament agreed to at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference embodies a commitment by States Parties to make every effort to ensure that the IAEA has the financial and human resources necessary to meet effectively its responsibilities in the areas of technical co-operation safeguards and nuclear safety.
While Malaysia is highly appreciative of the developmental role that the IAEA is continuing to play in assisting the developing States Parties in planning for, and in the use of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes, my delegation firmly believes that more could be done to advance the inalienable rights of developing States Parties, especially, to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy, as well as the right to participate in the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material and technology for peaceful purposes, without discrimination and in conformity with their respective safeguards agreements, as enshrined under Article IV of the Treaty.
Having foresworn nuclear weapons, developing non-nuclear weapon States Parties to the Treaty deserve to be accorded preferential treatment to access to nuclear equipment, material and technology, over non-States Parties, whether through the Technical Cooperation of the IAEA, or through bilatera! arrangements. Unfortunately, we are now witnessing the tendency for more developed States Parlies to loosen their national policies against nuclear cooperation with non-States Parties, following the lead of a certain nuclear weapon State Party.
Mr. Chairman,
Notwithstanding the fact that this session's focus of discussion is on Cluster ill issues, my delegation wishes to recall that in the debate on Cluster II issues yesterday one delegation had repeatedly mentioned the term non-proliferation non-compliance. As far as my delegation understands it. the word compliance does not appear in that form, at all, in the text of the NPT In fact the word "comply" only appears once, in Article III.3 of the Treaty, and, even so, only in relation tc the application of safeguards, I quote "The safeguards required by this Article shall be implemented in a manner designed to comply with Article IV of this Treaty, and to avoid in a manner designed to comply with Article IV of this Treaty, and to avoid hampering the economic or technological development of the Parties or international' co-operation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities, including the international exchange of nuclear material and equipment for the processing, use or production of nuclear material for peaceful purposes m
- Please check against acii
accordance with the provisions of this Article and the principle of safeguarding set forth m the Preamble of the Treaty," unquote.
In this respect, my delegation is concerned at the tendency of certain developed NPT States Parties which seem to place greater importance on the non-proliferation safeguards activities of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), at the expense of the development of peaceful uses for the benefit of developing NPT States Parties. In my delegation's view, such a state of affairs, increasingly tighten restrictions on access to nuclear equipment, material and technology by entities external to the framework of the NPT, and coupled with disarmament non-compliance on the part of nuclear weapon States, threatens to undermine the underlying balance and bargain enshrined in the Treaty
Mr. Chairman,
Malaysia has consistently fulfilled its financial obligations to the IAEA in fuii and in a timely manner, and has also contributed to the IAEA Extra Budgetary Fund, in order to help realise the rights of NPT States Parties to benefit from peaceful of nuclear energy. In addition, Malaysia has hosted numerous Regional Training Courses, and received IAEA Fellows from other States Parties, besides providing its experts to other States, either under the IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme or the Regional Cooperative Agreement for Research, Development and Training related to Nuclear Science and Technology in Asia and the Pacific (RCA), administered through the IAEA. Malaysia also recognises the contributions of other States, in particular the major donor States, which have contributed extra-budgetary resources on top of their assessed contribution to the IAEA Technical Cooperation Fund.
My delegation views such contributions as an important part of the fulfilment cf the undertaking under Article IV.2 of the NPT, towards renewing confidence in the role of the Treaty in farthering the social and economic development of all States Parties, particularly the developing States Parties Towards this end, my delegation would urge States Parties to renew and enhance their political commitment towards ensuring that the IAEA has adequate resources for this purpose
Turning to the increasing interest in nuclear power generation in the face of rising global energy prices and correspondingly, the importance in ensuring sustainable development ic mitigate adverse climate change that we are already witnessing in many areas of the world today, my delegation welcomes the growing initiative to pursue multilateral approaches to both the front and back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, as a means of addressing the current proliferation and security challenges arising from proliferation-sensitive operations within the nuclear fuel cycle, including the work of the Expert Group on Multilateral Approaches to the Nuclear Fuel Cycle that was established by the IAEA Director General in 2004.
However, my delegation is of the view that any multilateral approach to the nuclear fuel cycle should not adversely affect the fundamental inalienable rights of the NPT States Parties to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes, either by imposing a mandatory permanent suspension of any part of such rights as a pre-condition for the participation by any NPT State Party in any such multilateral approach, or otherwise. Further, my delegation is also of the view that a temporary voluntary waiver of such rights as a pre-condition for participation in any such multilateral approach, but effective only for the duration of the multilateral arrangement, subject to a continued assurance of supply to the relevant nuclear fuel cycle services and material, and with appropriate guarantees, including guaranteed financial and other relevant compensation for failure of supply for reasons other than any violation or breach of nuclear non-proliferation commitments, could be considered as it would contribute towards achieving the larger objective of strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime, which is an obligation of all NPT States Parties.
Thank you.
