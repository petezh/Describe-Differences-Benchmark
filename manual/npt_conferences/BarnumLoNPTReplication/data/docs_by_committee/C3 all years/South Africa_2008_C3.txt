Chairperson,
My delegation associates itself fully with the statement made on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement on the issue of peaceful uses of nuclear technology. South Africa's approach on this matter is based on the free and voluntary agreement we all reached when joining the NPT that peaceful nuclear co-operation and access to the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, pursuant to Article IV of the Treaty, are integral components of the NPT. The peaceful use of nuclear technology is an inalienable right provided for under the Treaty.
Chairperson,
In view of concerns regarding energy security, promoting economic development and climate change, more and more countries are looking at the development of nuclear energy. During the 50lh Anniversary General Conference of the IAEA it became clear that the international community will see a substantial increase in the development of nuclear plans for the production of electricity.
The anticipated expanded use of nuclear energy, have prompted some States to express concerns about proliferation and propose restrictions and controls over the legitimate peaceful uses of nuclear energy. There is a widespread perception that while demands are being made for non-nuclear-weapon States to agree to various new measures in the name of non-proliferation, concrete actions towards nuclear disarmament are neglected.
Chairperson,
South Africa reiterates its full support for activities related to nuclear science, technology and applications undertaken by the IAEA. In this regard, we would like to acknowledge and emphasise the important role that the Agency is playing, through its Technical Cooperation Projects, in enhancing the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and its targets, which are based on the Millennium Development Goals.
There is an acknowledgement of the increasing role that the IAEA will have to play in the future, as new and more countries turn to nuclear energy. Many States are approaching the Agency to advise them in the preparatory, start-up, running and end-life phases of their nuclear facilities. In particular, developing countries look towards the Agency to draw from lessons learned, shared experience and advice for best practice in relation to peaceful nuclear applications and technologies. There is also a need to address how nuclear expertise and knowledge could be maintained and shared.
However, in order to ensure the Agency's full support in all these tasks, the IAEA's Technical Co-operation Projects must be strengthened. Contributions to the TC Fund need to be sufficient, predictable and assured and funding must be increased in order to enable the Agency to fulfill its statutory mandate, namely "... to seek to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world".
My delegation commends countries that have supported the Technical Co-operation Projects with voluntary contributions. However, in order to ensure that funds for this integral part of the Agency's activities are at a reliable level, South Africa has stated in the Board of Governors that perhaps the time has come to incorporate them into the regular budget of the IAEA.
Chairperson,
South Africa also attaches great importance to the safety of materials, activities and facilities throughout the whole nuclear fuel cycle. In this regard, South Africa remains committed to implement the Agency's Safety Standards and Fundamentals and commends the IAEA's assistance to Member States in the area of nuclear safety. My delegation furthermore wishes to reaffirm the importance of safety-related conventions, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety. In this regard, South Africa was honoured to preside over the 4th Review Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention that was held in Vienna from 14 to 25 April 2008.
During the 51st Regular Session of the IAEA General Conference in September 2007, discussions with the Agency were continued on South Africa's initiative towards establishing an African Regional Regulatory Forum and follow-up deliberations were envisaged with interested partners on the continent. The Agency will provide assistance in this process and advise on lessons learned, in particular from the Asian Nuclear Safety Network (ANSN) and the Ibero-American Nuclear and Radiation Safety Network.
Chairperson,
Regarding uranium beneficiation programmes, South Africa is also faced with a growing interest in nuclear energy for its growing electricity demands. In this regard, South Africa's Minister of Minerals and Energy, Ms Buyelwa Sonjica, stated during the 51sl Regional Session of the IAEA General Conference that South Africa's nuclear energy policy is driven by issues of security of energy supply and global climate change, as well as beneficiation of our strategic mineral resources for the economic development of our country. The resurgence in the use of nuclear energy for electricity production is strong and many countries, including South Africa, have realised the need to diversify their energy mix to ensure security of supply and to maintain their economies.
Chairperson,
Since the issue of assured fuel supply came under discussion at the IAEA, South Africa has closely followed the evolution of various concepts and proposals. In this regard, South Africa appreciates the briefings and further clarifications provided by proponents of some of these proposals. We acknowledge that the matter of assured nuclear fuel supplies needs to be further considered without infringing on the Article IV rights of States Parties to the NPT.
The establishment of credible mechanisms to assure the reliable supply of nuclear fuel should involve the IAEA, which has a legitimate role in accordance with its Statute to encourage and assist the practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Furthermore, the Agency also has a special responsibility, arising
from its Statute, to take into consideration the needs of the under-developed areas of
the world.
It has been repeatedly stated that these discussions focussing on the need for - and the possible framework of - a mechanism to ensure access to nuclear fuel, should not involve any preconditions. Neither should they contemplate the possibility that non-nuclear-weapon States, in conformity with their legal obligations under the NPT, should forgo certain aspects of their inalienable right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
In conclusion Chairperson,
South Africa believes that the strength, credibility and permanence of the NPT rests on a fundamental bargain which must be recognized and upheld if we want the Treaty to be effective and lasting by virtue of its own merits, rather than letting it be used to serve selective interests through the perpetuation of discrimination and imbalance. The peaceful use of nuclear energy is an inalienable and integral right that cannot be compromised or taken away either unilaterally or by a group of countries.
I thank you.
