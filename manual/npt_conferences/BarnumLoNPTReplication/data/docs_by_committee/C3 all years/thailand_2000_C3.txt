
Mr. Chairman, 
Since I take the floor for the first time, I would like to congratulate you on your election to chair this Main Committee. I believe that, with your skills and experience, you would help steer this meeting to a fruitful conclusion. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The development of peaceful uses of nuclear is one of the main pillars of the NPT regime that this Committee is tasked to review. Decision 2 of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference on Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament was adopted by consensus as part of the package deal to strengthen the implementation and review process of the NPT. The decision, inter alia, encompasses technical co-operation and technology transfer, which are the vital elements for developing countries. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Thailand takes note with satisfaction the significant progress and achievements of technical co-operation activities of the IAEA, despite the unpredictable and unassured resources. We commend the IAEA for its role as a key mechanism for scientific and technical co-operation for peaceful uses of nuclear energy as well as for technology transfer to its developing member states. We wish to encourage the IAEA to continue to do so. We also believe that this effort would yield more tangible results only if and when all concerned live up to their funding commitments. We are convinced that the role of the IAEA would be expanded as the trend of peaceful nuclear applications in developing countries is growing. In this regard, we also welcome the IAEA's effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of technical co-operation and technology transfer activities to better serve development goals of its member states. In this connection, emphasis should also be placed on international cooperation for the promotion of nuclear safety standards, radioactive waste management and security of nuclear materials. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Thailand has long supported, and will continue to support, the IAEA's technical programmes and activities as well as the implementation of the Regional Co-operative Agreement for Research, Development and Training related to Nuclear Science and Technology (RCA). Because they are vital to our country's sustainable development. We are also strongly committed to the provisions of the NPT. Thailand, therefore, has done her best to pledge and pay her share in full to the Technical Co-operation Fund-TCF despite the economic difficulties home. And we will continue to do so, for we believe the TCF, though voluntary in character, should be treated as a political commitment consistent with the Treaty's obligation. The fund needs to be predictable, adequate and assured. We therefore urge the member states of the Agency to fulfil their obligations and to make their full contributions to the TCF target. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Under the NPT, States parties have the inalienable right to engage in research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination. As such, any unjustified restriction on export of materials, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes to developing countries, to us, is inconsistent with and not warranted by the provisions of the Treaty. The export control for the purpose of promoting non-proliferation should be implemented in a transparent and realistic manner within the framework of dialogue and cooperation among all interested States parties. 
Mr. Chairman, 
We accept that there is a linkage between peaceful nuclear cooperation and nuclear non-proliferation provisions. States parties thus are obliged to ensure that cooperation will not pose any risk or contribute to nuclear proliferation. On the other hand, the promotion of the non-proliferation, in whichever form, must not impede the technical cooperation and transfer of technology. It will be unacceptable to my delegation if nuclear non-proliferation under Article I of the NPT are pursued by Nuclear-Weapon States at the expense of peaceful use of nuclear energy by the compliant non-nuclear-weapon States. The Nuclear-Weapon States, on the other hand, have the responsibility under the NPT to ensure that their nuclear materials and technology are not falling into the hands of the non-compliant states without passing the cost in so doing to the compliant non-nuclear-weapon states. 
In closing, my delegation hopes that all of us here at the meeting would act in good faith and with the spirit of accommodation to ensure the right and benefits of peaceful use of nuclear energy of all States parties to the NPT.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
