Mr. Chairman
In addition to the Statement of behalf of our five Central Asian states, I would like to speak briefly on behalf of the Kyrgyz Republic to inform the distinguished delegates, that by the initiative of President Bakiev, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and UNDP will organize in fall 2008 a High Level meeting in Bishkek on problems of uranium tailings and other radio active wastes in our region.
This meeting in Kyrgyzstan will bring together high level representatives from interested countries, International Organizations, donor Countries, NGOs, and scientists in order to adopt a Joint plan of action to implement measures on prevention of ecological and environmental catastrophe in CA.
My delegation is also appreciative of the attention given to this problem by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and wishes to note an important article on the subject in the March 2008 issue of IAEA Bulletin.
In this regard, I would like to reiterate an «Appeal of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, the UNDP, and the Secretariat of the Integration Committee of the Eurasian Economic Community, made in Bishkek on 7 September 2007."
We call on donor countries to consider giving appropriate assistance to expedite the clean-up and disposal of radioactive contaminants in our region, and to support the Kyrgyz Republic and the UNDP in convening an International Conference to find a comprehensive solution to the problem.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
