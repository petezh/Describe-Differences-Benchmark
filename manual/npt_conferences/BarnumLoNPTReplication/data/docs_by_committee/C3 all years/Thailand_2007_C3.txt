Mr. Chairman,
Since this is the first time I take the floor, I would like to congratulate you on your election as the Chairman of this Preparatory Committee. 1 am confident that, with your able leadership and experience, our meeting will be steered towards a fruitful conclusion. My delegation associates itself with the statement of NAM States Parties to the NPT.
Mr. Chairman,
The peaceful uses of nuclear energy constitute one of the main pillars of the NPT as prescribed in Article IV. My delegation reaffirms that nothing shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable rights of all the parties to the NPT to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I, II and III of the T reaty We also believe that it is the prerogative of each State Party to pursue its policies on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and decisions on appropriate nuclear fuel cycles so long as such undertaking is consistent with its treaty obligations.
Thailand also wishes to highlight the importance of a balanced approach in complying with the peaceful nuclear cooperation and nuclear non-proliferation provisions of the NPT. It will be unacceptable to my delegation if nuclear non-proliferation under Article I of the NPT, advocated by Nuclear-Weapon States, would entail any negative impact on the technical cooperation and transfer of technology of the compliant Non-Nuclear-Weapon States. We believe that the export control for the purpose of promoting non-proliferation should be implemented in a transparent and realistic manner within the framework of dialogue and cooperation Therefore, am unjustified restriction on export to developing countries of nuclear materials, equipment and technology, for peaceful and civilian purposes would be deemed
inconsistent with the provisions of the Treaty.
Equally important, Thailand reaffirms its conviction that the international Atomic Energy Agency is the sole competent authority responsible for \erifying and assuring compliance by States Parties with their safeguards agreement undertaken in fulfillment of their obligations under Article III, paragraph 1, of the NPT. with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Accordingly, we are of the view that all members of the IAEA should strictly observe the Agency's Statute and should not undermine the authority, integrity and credibility of the Agency in its verification acti\ hies,
Mr. Chairman,
Thailand commends the IAEA for its instrumental role and achievements in promoting scientific and technical cooperation for peaceful uses of nuclear energy as well as technology transfer to its developing Member States. We have always maintained close collaboration with the Agency in carrying out TC activities, particularly in agriculture, human health, isotope hydrology, nuclear and radiation safety, as well as nuclear power, which is an area of emerging interest in Thailand. We also attach importance to the participation in the Regional Co-operative Agreement for Research, Development and Training related to Nuclear Science and Technology or RCA. These activities are vital to our country's sustainable socioeconomic development.
While Thailand welcomes the Agency's continued efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its TC projects by introducing various new measures such as the IT-based platform called "Programme Cycle Management Framework or PCMF," we also recognize the fact that its ability to deliver TC projects and activities is often challenged by the unpredictable financial resources. We believe thai the work of the IAEA would yield more tangible results only if and when all concerned live up to their funding commitments. On our part, Thailand has done its best to pledge and pay its voluntary contribution to the Technical Cooperation Fund or TCF despite the economic difficulties at home. And we will continue to do so. for we believe the TCF should be regarded as a political commitment consistent with the Treaty's obligation. The fund needs to be predictable, adequate and assured. We therefore urge Member
States of the Agency to fulfill their obligations and make their full contributions to the TCF target.
Mr. Chairman,
In closing, my delegation hopes that that all of us here can continue to work together in good faith and with the spirit of accommodation to ensure that the rights and benefits of peaceful use of nuclear energy of States parties to the NPT are well promoted.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
