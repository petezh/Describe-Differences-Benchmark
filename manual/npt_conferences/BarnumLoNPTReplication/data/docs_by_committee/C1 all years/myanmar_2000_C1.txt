Mr. Chairman, 
I am very much delighted to see you chairing the Main Committee I of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. My delegation will fully cooperate with you for the advancement of the work of the Committee. 
Mr. Chairman, 
This Review Conference is taking place at a time which is not particularly encouraging and not particularly conducive to arms control and disarmament. The three PrepCom sessions were also unable to forward substantive recommendations to this Conference. 
At the same time, we are encouraged to note that there have been a couple of positive developments in the past few weeks. We welcome the recent ratifications of the START II Treaty and the CIBT by the Russian Federation. These positive developments will make perceptible contribution to the discussions and deliberations at this Conference. 
We come to this Conference with a positive attitude. We believe that moderate tangible results are within our reach, provided that all States Parties, including the Nuclear Weapon States, show flexibility and realism, and have a strong determination to achieve such results. 
Mr. Chairman, 
As a matter of fact, this Review Conference has already made a good start. For the first time in the history of the NPT, two subsidiary bodies have been established at a Review Conference, in addition to the Main Committees, to undertake substantive world. This is significant. All of us should make joint efforts to follow through such a good start to ensure a successful and productive conclusion of the work of this Committee and the Review Conference. 
Mr. Chairman, 
At this early stage of the deliberations, it will be premature to surmise on the final product of the Conference. We are in favour of the maximization of the results of the Conference. 
At the same time, I should like to stress that the bare minimum we expect from this Conference is a set of Principles and Objectives, required by and relevant to the present time and the twenty-first century. 
As regards the principles, we may simply reaffirm the principles in the Decision 2 of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. 
With regard to the objectives, we do need to set the objectives that are required by and relevant to the present time and the twenty-first century. Allow me, Mr. Chairman, to share with the Members of the Main Committee I some of my thoughts on possible elements on P & O, to be included in the final product of this Conference. 

Strengthened Review Process
The fine precedent, set by this Review Conference in establishing the two Subsidiary Bodies, should be maintained and carried forward The future NPT Review Conferences as well as the PrepCom Sessions should have these two Subsidiary Bodies and any other subsidiary bodies, as required, to enable the States Parties to undertake substantive work and make progress on important issues.
Interim measures 
The following interim measures will contribute to the reduction of nuclear danger and to nuclear disarmament : 
- review and adaptation of nuclear policies to reduce the nuclear danger; 
- de-emphasizing the role of nuclear weapons; 
- de-alerting and de-activating nuclear weapons;
Nuclear disarmament 
Achievement of the following measures is essential for the full realization and effective implementation of Article VI : 
- early entry into force of the CTBT and the continuing observance of moratorium of nuclear test explosions; 
- the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a universal, nondiscriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable convention, banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, in accordance with the statement of the Special Coordinator of the Conference on Disarmament and the mandate contained therein and, pending entry into force of the Convention, observance of a moratorium on the production of Missile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices; 
- the determined pursuit of systematic and progressive efforts to carry out further deep reductions of nuclear weapons by the Nuclear Weapon States with a view to the total elimination of nuclear weapons; 
- the commencement among the Nuclear Weapon States of plurilateral negotiations at an appropriate stage on further deep reductions of nuclear weapons as an effective measure of nuclear disarmament; 
- the establishment in the Conference on Disarmament of an ad hoc committee to address the issue of nuclear disarmament;
Security assurances 
- The States Parties should agree on the need to conclusion of an internationally and legally-binding instrument to effectively assure non-nuclear weapon States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. 
To this end, the States Parties should take further steps to provide adequate security assurances to the non-nuclear weapon States Parties in the form of an internationally and legally-binding instrument.
Nuclear-weapon-free zones 
- expeditious completion of consultations on an amendment to the Protocol to the SEANWFZ Treaty among the parties concerned and early accessions by the Nuclear Weapon States thereto and entry into force of the Protocol; 
- formal recognition and observance of the nuclear-weapon-free status of Mongolia; 
- early completion of negotiations on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Central Asia; 
These are some of the suggestions of the Myanmar delegation on possible elements on P &: O, to be included in the final product of this Conference. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference has set a good example. We should follow its example. The 1995 Review and Extension Conference adopted 3 Decisions and 1 Resolution. Apart from the possible decision on P & O, this Conference will do well to adopt decisions on important subjects such as nuclear disarmament and security assurances and a resolution on the Middle East. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Such decisions and such a resolution will be concrete hallmarks of a major success of this Conference. To this end, let us do our utmost to advance our substantive work in the Subsidiary Bodies, the Main Committees and the 2000 NPT Review Conference.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
