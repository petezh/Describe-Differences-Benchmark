Nuclear Disarmament
(Cluster I)

Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
My delegation is of the view that the NPT should continue to function as a cornerstone of
global peace and security by effectively reducing the threat of nuclear weapons through the
balanced pursuit of its mutually-reinforcing three pillars – nuclear disarmament, nuclear
non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Amongst them, nuclear disarmament
holds vital importance to the realization of a world without nuclear weapons.
In view of the risk of accidental nuclear war and its indiscriminate catastrophic
consequences, it is the collective duty of all NPT State Parties to fulfill their obligations
under Article VI of the NPT. However, given the estimated 18,000 nuclear weapons in the
world as well as the wide gap in perception between nuclear and nonnuclear weapon states
in terms of pace of nuclear disarmament, it is true that we still have a long way to go to
reach our ultimate goal.
Mr. Chairman,
The first and foremost task for nuclear disarmament falls on the shoulders of nuclear
weapon states. In this context, my delegation appreciates the ongoing reductions in nuclear
arsenals by the two major nuclear powers, the United States and Russia, under the New
START. In addition, we welcome the announcement by President Obama on the US’
interest in further bilateral reductions. My delegation encourages P-5 countries to keep up

the momentum of plurilateral confidence building measures for nuclear disarmament. Along
these lines, and with a view to achieving concrete outcomes, all the nuclear weapon states
are urged to redouble their efforts to reduce nuclear weapons. We took note of the joint
statement made by the P5 at its 4th Conference held in Geneva last week where they
emphasized the importance of continuing to work together in implementing the 2010 Action
Plan.
However, despite the ongoing efforts for nuclear disarmament, there still exist concerns
regarding the modernization of nuclear weapons. It should be reminded that such measures
to improve the functioning of nuclear weapons, which might eventually neutralize the
decrease in the nominal number of warheads, are contrary to the obligation to pursue
nuclear disarmament in good faith.
Mr. Chairman,
My Government values the status and legitimacy of the Conference on Disarmament (CD)
here in Geneva as the premier forum for disarmament. However, the long stalemate in the
CD since the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1996 is a
source of concern. Likewise, across the Atlantic, the UN Disarmament Commission has also
been unable to make substantive progress since it adopted the Guideline on NuclearWeapon-Free Zone in 1999. In fact, the multilateral disarmament machinery is in disarray.
Regrettably, attempts in the CD to achieve consensus on the program of work have been
consistently blocked and prevented. For their part, it is high time for member states of the
CD to answer the calls of the international community by promptly revitalizing its work.

Mr. Chairman,

My delegation believes that the negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT) is
the next logical step toward a world without nuclear weapons. We hope that the work of the
Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on FMCT will lay the foundation for a negotiation
in the CD. In the meantime we urge all states with nuclear capabilities to voluntarily declare
moratoria on the production of fissile materials for weapons purposes, if they have not done
so.
The entry into force of the CTBT is crucial to strengthening nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation regime. My delegation calls upon those states that have yet to ratify the CTBT,
in particular the eight remaining States listed in Annex II, to do so without any further delay.
We also stress the importance of maintaining the moratorium on nuclear test explosions
pending the entry into force of the CTBT.
Finally, my delegation takes note of a series of nuclear disarmament initiatives, such as the
conference on the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons and the Open-Ended Working
Group and so forth. We hope that such initiatives will contribute to a further move forward
with the nuclear disarmament agenda, without prejudice to the efforts to bring the CD back
on track.
Mr. Chairman,

It is our sincere hope that the 2015 Review Conference will revitalize the NPT based on
what we achieved in the 2010 Review Conference. This second PrepCom meeting should be
a valuable opportunity for all of us to reflect upon the implementation of the Actions over
the past three years and reaffirm our collective commitment to a world without nuclear
weapons. The Republic of Korea will continue to do its utmost towards achieving this
shared goal.

I thank you.
