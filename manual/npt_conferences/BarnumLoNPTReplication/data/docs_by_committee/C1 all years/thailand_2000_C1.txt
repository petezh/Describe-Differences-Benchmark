
Mr. Chairman, 
Allow me, at the outset, to share the sentiments of the previous speakers in congratulating you on your election as Chairman of the Main Committee 1. 
Mr. Chairman, 
This Main Committee is entrusted with very important tasks of deliberating next practical steps towards security assurance arrangement for the protection of Non-Nuclear Weapon States (NNWS) against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, and reviewing the progress of the implementation of Article VII of the NPT. We attach great importance to the deliberations of this Committee because the NNWS, which have voluntarily forgone or have no aspiration for the nuclear weapon option, are still living with fear of nuclear danger, and because the sole survival of NNWS, including my country, in a nuclear world as is the case now is depending on the security assurance by the NWS. 
Thailand shares the view of the Non-Aligned Movement that, in the final analysis, the true guarantee for all NNWS against the nuclear danger lies in the total elimination of nuclear weapons themselves. Short of such achievement meanwhile, what we need is nothing less than the concrete guarantee by NWS against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons. We therefore fully subscribe to the proposal for an international legally-binding negative security assurance regime which is honored by all NWS and covers all NNWS as an interim measure. In light of the fact that the credibility and/or viability of the NPT regime is at the critical juncture, Thailand is convinced that the conclusion of such a security assurance arrangement is of vital importance as a confidence building measure for the NNWS. We therefore support the proposal that this NPT Review Conference should pave the way towards the negotiation aimed at concluding a binding international instrument, in the form of an annexed protocol to the NPT. 
Mr. Chairman, 
Whereas the conclusion of such international legally-binding negative security assurance regime will offer protection from nuclear danger at the global level, it should also be coupled by provisions of such assurance to the parties of Nuclear Weapon Free Zones (NWFZs) treaties in various regions of the world. 
Thailand took a very keen interest in promoting nuclear weapon free zones, which are in keeping with Article VII of the NPT. We are of the view that the creation of NWFZ is a step forward in the right direction for the realization of the objectives of the NPT regime and towards the goal of nuclear weapons free world, a fact well recognized by the 1995 Review and Extension Conference. We believe that NWFZs would greatly enhance regional security and serve as confidence building measure in the areas concerned. However, for the NWFZs to fully fulfill their principal objective, we urge all NWS to support the aims of various NWFZ treaties and arrangements, and the effort to create new NWFZs, on the basis of arrangements freely reached among regional states concerned. 
With regard to the Bangkok Treaty or the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone (SEANWFZ), Thailand, as Depository State of the Treaty and the current Chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, wishes to appeal to the NWS to exercise greater flexibility in the discussions on the Protocol to the Treaty. While it appears that remaining issues to be resolved on the Protocol have been further clarified and narrowed down, there is still a need for greater urgency in the negotiation process in order to build up impetus. In this regard, ASEAN welcomes China's readiness to be the first NWS to sign the Protocol. And we encourage other NWS to do likewise. 
Mr. Chairman, 
For NWFZ to be a major contribution to the overall nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and hence to the global security, Thailand believes that the parties to the various NWFZ treaties should enhance their cooperation and solidarity in a more systematic manner toward the common goal of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. Our past common endeavor in the UN General Assembly concerning the resolutions on the Nuclear Weapon Free Southern Hemisphere and Adjacent Areas is the shining example and a strong threshold for further strengthening of our future cooperation. 
Mr. Chairman, 
The Thai delegation comes to this Conference with a positive attitude and an open mind. We are more than happy to work together with other state parties toward the meaningful outcome of the Conference on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Because we owe this not to ourselves but to our children for the sake of humanity and freedom from fear.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
