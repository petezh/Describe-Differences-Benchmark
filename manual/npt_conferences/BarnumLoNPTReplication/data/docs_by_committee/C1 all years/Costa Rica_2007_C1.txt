Your Excellency Mr Chair of the First Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Costa Rica has the honour to introduce working paper NPT/CONF.2010/PC.l/WP. 17 which we have submitted in conjunction with Malaysia.
The working paper includes a Model Nuclear Weapons Convention which is an updated version of the original Model Nuclear Weapons Convention circulated in 1997 by the United Nations Secretary-General as UN Document A/C. 1/52/7. This revised Model takes into account relevant technical, legal and political developments since 1997.
The working paper also includes an explanation of the reason for submitting the Model Nuclear Weapons Convention to this meeting. It is submitted to assist Stales Parties to the NPT in their deliberations with respect to implementation of Article VI in addition to other articles. It explores the legal, technical and political elements required for the achievement and maintenance of a nuclear weapons free world. In this respect it goes beyond the obligations of States Parties to the NPT to also address disarmament and non-proliferation obligations of all States under customary international law - including States not Parties to the NPT - as affirmed by the International Court of Justice in its 1996 advisory opinion on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear w eapons.
Costa Rica believes that the Model NWC will become a useful resource for deliberations on implementation of Article VI of the NPT. As such we have invited other delegations to join this initiative and have received an indication that a number are interested in so doing.
The Model NWC includes and expands on disarmament steps agreed at the NPT Review Conferences of 1995 and 2000 such as:
•	a prohibition of nuclear testing
•	an end to production of fissile materials for military' purposes and systematic steps towards nuclear disarmament
•	an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals
•	concrete agreed measures to further reduce the operational status of nuclear weapons systems
•	steps by all the nuclear weapon States leading to nuclear disarmament in a way that promotes international stability
•	the principle of irreversibility to apply to nuclear disarmament, and
•	development ofthe verification capabilities that will be required to provide assurance of compliance with nuclear disarmament agreements for the achievement and maintenance of a nuclear weapon free world.
Comprehensive nuclear disarmament is complicated and might not be achieved in one step or with one treaty. Thus, the Model NWC serves as a guide to what would be necessary in either a single convention or a package of agreements.
Political, legal and technical developments during nuclear disarmament negotiations could result in a nuclear abolition regime that might differ in some aspects from that suggested in the Model NWC. Regardless, the Model NWC demonstrates the feasibility of nuclear disarmament and should serve to assist in the commencement and conclusion of negotiations for this purpose, as required under Article VI of the NPT and affirmed as customary law by the International Court of Justice.
Costa Rica commends the Chair and the delegations to this first session for reaching agreement in order to commence substantive work and we hope that the ideas presented in this working paper will assist progress in nuclear disarmament in order to ensure a successful 2010 Review Conference.
