Mr. President,
At the outset, I wish to express to you, in the name of the State of Kuwait, our most sincere felicitations on the occasion of your election as Chairman of the 2rcf Session of the Preparatory Committee of the NPT Review Conference of the year 2010. We are certain that your wisdom and experience will contribute to a successful conduct of the work of the Committee, in order to achieve the goal we all aspire to reach. My country's delegation wishes to assure you of its full cooperation, with you, as well as with all the delegations participating in order to achieve this goal. It also pleases me to express our support to the statement of the representative of Indonesia on behalf of the group of the Non-Aligned Movement, as well as the statement of the representative of Syria, in the name of the Arab Group.
Mr. President,
This meeting is considered as an important step in bolstering the work of the review conference scheduled for 2010. Bringing into being a world that is totally free from all nuclear weapons arsenals is a noble purpose that must be realized. The international community is still witnessing a growing number of challenges that are jeopardizing international peace and security and threatening the credibility of existing international treaties and agreements, an accomplished legacy that must be strengthened and activated. However, we are still witnessing a real regression in what concerns achieving nuclear universality of the IMPT, which is the cornerstone of disarmament and non-proliferation system. The neglect by some states party to the NPT to pursue the implementation of the decisions and outcomes of the previous Review Sessions as well as being selective as to what degree is the Convention binding, represent a serious infringement on its credibility and undermines all the efforts exerted and endeavours pursued, it also casts doubt on the purpose of the treaty and its universality, and creates a gap in the reciprocal trust between states, which threaten the issues of security balance as well as regional and international stability.

Mr. President,
The State of Kuwait absolutely believes that the possession of nuclear weapons does not guarantee the security of any country, while the proliferation of these deadly weapons will increase tensions and conflicts among peoples. Therefore, my country views with grave concern the currently prevailing international situation, and in particular, that the IVliddle East Region still faces serious threats and security risks from the proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction. Even after thirteen years have elapsed since the 1995 decision concerning the Middle East was issued, and which provides for the creation of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, the region is still a glaring example of the deficiency of the Treaty in achieving security for the states party to it. It is therefore our hope that all the states party to the NPT would adhere to their obligations as provided by the Treaty and by the safeguard agreement, as well as cooperate closely with the IAEA to clarify all the doubts and questions that are raised surrounding their programs, through negotiations and constructive dialogue.
In this context, we demand from Israel, the only country in the Middle East, that has not yet acceded to the NPT, and the only country which possess nuclear weapons, in defiance of the decisions of international legality and repeated international calls to immediately accede to the Treaty, rid itself of its nuclear arsenal and subject all of its nuclear facilities to the safeguard system of the IAEA. The status of Israel represent a clear infraction in the balance of power and is a source of constant worry to the Middle East region. The State of Kuwait demands from the International Community to stop bolstering the sales of scientific and technological means which contribute to the Israel's nuclear weapons, or that of any other country that seeks to develop its program to produce weapons of mass destruction.
Mr. President,
The State of Kuwait firmly believes in the central and important role of the United Nations in confronting the main challenges, foremost among which is to ban the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The approach to address this issue and other issues of relevance has been clearly specified in numerous treaties, agreements, decisions and work programs that were reached. What is now required from the member states is to adhere to their commitments, cooperate and coordinate with each other, in implementing their obligations. The lack of political will is the core of the problem, therefore, efforts and endeavours must continue to take the necessary action needed for high-level and fateful decisions to be taken, in order to activate the internationally agreed upon arrangements. This requires as, to reinforce our deliberations in this forum, as a general priority towards the following:
•	The total and non-selective implementation of the provisions of the NPT, and in particular article 6 regarding disarmament and article 4 regarding the facilitation of peaceful applications of nuclear technology.
•	Adherence to the principles contained in the final document of the 10th Extraordinary Session of the General Assembly, as well as to the outcome of the Review Conference of the states party to the NPT in 1995, and the final document of the 2000 Review Conference, particularly what concerns the 13 steps.
•	Taking more effective measures that would ensure demanding from the states that has not acceded to the NPT till now, to do so immediately, in order to strengthen the effectiveness and ensure universality of this treaty.
•	Reemphasize the inalienable right of states to obtain the necessary technology, development and expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear energy within the context allowed by relevant international treaties.
•	Work closely with the IAEA to dispel any ambiguity surrounding nuclear programs through negotiations and constructive dialogue.
•	Reemphasize what was contained in the Final Declaration of the Fourth Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which calls upon all states that has not ratified that Treaty to do so.
•	Support the efforts aiming at the creation of a legally binding international instrument on the illegality of the use or the threat to use nuclear weapons to resolve conflicts, as well as providing assurances to non-nuclear states of that.
•	Adherence to the resolution of 1995 to make the Middle East region, a region free from all weapons of mass destruction and seek to achieve that goal.
Finally, Mr. President, we hope that the work of this preparatory session would reach a consensus on all the core issues put forward, and that the consultations will be characterized by transparency and inclusiveness, as well as achieve international peace and security which we all aspire to realize.
Than you, Mr. President.
