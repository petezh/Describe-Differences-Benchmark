STATEMENT
BY
BUKUN-OLU ONEMOLA
AMBASSADOR/DEPUTY PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF NIGERIA TO THE UNITED NATIONS
AT THE
THIRD SESSION OF THE PREPARATORY COMMITTEE FOR THE 2010 REVIEW CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF
NUCLEAR WEAPONS
NEW YORK, 4th MAY 2009
Mr. Chairman,
On behalf of the Nigerian delegation, I congratulate you on your election and wish to assure you and the Bureau of the full cooperation of my delegation. Nigeria aligns itself with the statement made by the African Group.
The issues that divide us in reaching consensus on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament are self inflicted and no solution would come our way until we recoil our positions and switch to a new template that projects a compromise solution and a new course of action that points to the right direction, which we are all aware of - those elements that stifled the first and second sessions of the Preparatory Committee meetings in 2007 and 2008.
Nigeria believes that we can seize the current favourable political environment to leap frog in the attainment of the three disarmament pillars, namely: nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energy disarmament.
We are however pleased with the recent pronouncements and preparedness of some nuclear weapon states, including the Russia Federation and the United States who recently renewed their commitment towards reducing their nuclear armaments. We urge Member States especially NWS to take a cue from these two states in reducing their nuclear armaments.
Equally so is the prospects that is emerging at the multilateral level at the Conference on Disarmament. As regards non-proliferation, our expectation was that the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva would have inched forward than it presently stands regarding the negotiation of the FMCT. We urge the CD to come negotiation on a verifiable FMCT. We are no less disappointed that the CTBT is yet to enter into force we urge states that have not yet done so to ratify the CTBT.
In line with Article IV of the NPT, it is inalienable right of eveiy Member State to have access to peaceful use of nuclear energy to enhance prosperity and contribute to socio-economic development, hi this regard Nigeria is in full cooperation with the IAEA for assistance in technical cooperation having ratified the relevant instruments, including the additional protocol, and the safeguards agreement.
Multilateralism has served us well in the past, let us use this tool to flesh out commendable progress in the three disarmament pillars. We therefore call on Member States yet to adhere to the NPT to do so.
I thank you.
