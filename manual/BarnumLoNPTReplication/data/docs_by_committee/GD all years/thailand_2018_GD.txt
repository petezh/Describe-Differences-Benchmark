Mr. Chair,
1. The Kingdom of Thailand congratulates you on your assumption as Chair of
the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2020 Review Conference
of the Parties to the NPT. With your able guidance and leadership, I am confident
that we will achieve a successful conclusion to this meeting with a firm foundation
for further dialogue at the Review Conference in 2020.
2. Thailand aligns itself with the statement made by the distinguished delegate
of... on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) States Parties to the NPT.
Mr. Chair,
3. As we approach the 2020 Review Conference, which will also mark the 50fh
anniversary of this important treaty, we must take stock of what we have
accomplished to address the objective and purpose of the NPT, and use them to
inform on how best to move forward to ensure that the Review Conference, as well
as the NPT itself, is a success.
4. For Thailand, that process of reflection has yielded a number of results.
First, we must always remember that the NPT comprises of 3 pillars: nuclear
disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation, and peaceful use of nuclear energy. It is
our firin belief that these three pillars must be addressed in a balanced manner.
5. In the same vein, Thailand believes that States Parties share equal
responsibility in the implementation of the NPT and all of its provisions. And for
the NPT to work as deemed "a cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation",
we call on all States Parties to honor and implement their obligations
and commitments under the NPT in full and without delay.
6. We also attach great importance on the inalienable rights of all States Parties
to develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination, as
stipulated in Article IV. We take pride and pains to apply the concepts of nuclear
security, safety, and safeguards in exercising these inalienable rights. The use of
nuclear technology must be accompanied by the assurances that it is used
exclusively for peaceful purposes. Therefore, we welcome strengthened safeguards
to warrant such assurances. Similarly, we welcome transparency and confidencebuilding
.i'neasures by nuclear-weapon States that ensure and mark their progress in
the nuclear weapons reduction and disari'na'i'nent process, with Article III of the
NPT in mind.
Mr. Chair,
7. Thailand recognizes 2017 as a year of historic success as the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) was adopted on July 7'h. The TPNW
reflects our determination to fulfill the IfT's Article VI in good faith. It is
purposefully designed to complement the NPT. As a Ratifying State to the TPNW,
Thailand wishes to encourage our partners to consider our views on the TPNW and
engage constructively in the dialogue and decisions toward its entry into force. ffust
as disarmament and non-proliferation are mutually reinforcing, the NPT and the
TPNW can both prosper working together hand in hand.
8. As a depositary state of the South East Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone
(SEANWFZ) or the Bangkok Treaty, Thailand supports the establishment of
nuclear weapon-free zones in all regions. We also call on all parties concerned to
support the early consultations on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, as stipulated in Article
VII and mandated by the 2010 NPT Review Conference. We believe that positive
progress on this matter will be a crucial success for the 2020 Review Conference.
Mr. Chair,
9. Talig stock also means lool6ng back at the outcomes of previous Review
Conferences and evaluating our performances which brought us to those conclusions,
or lack thereof. The failure to produce a substantive consensus outcome document at
the 2015 Review Conference should serve as a wake up call of the extra effort we
shall need to put forth if we hope to have a fruitful PrepCom now, and a
meaningful and productive Review Conference in 2020.
10. Furthermore, we must ensure that the process for the NPT, as well as the
treaty's raison d'etre, place people at the center. The very first clause in its
preamble brings up "the devastation that would be visited upon all manl6nd by a
nuclear war and the consequent need to make every effort to avert the danger of
such a war and to take measures to safeguard the security of the peoples." This is a
clear indication that a humanitarian view should be taken when we pursue our
work in the NPT.
11. Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament should also involve and be
implemented by the people. Civil society, industry, and academia are all
stakeholders in this endeavor and must be given seats and voices at the table,. If
provided with the opportunity to be engaged, not only can these stakeholders, in
turn, bring diversified perspectives to the conversation, but they can also inject
fresh energy, ideas and resolve to the cause. Thailand therefore appreciates the role
and contribution of civil societies in pursuing the disarmament agenda in good
faith. We have seen the progress these stakeholders can bring about. The
International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons' (ICAN) efforts toward the
negotiation and adoption of the, TPNW is certainly one example that comes to
mind. We should harness that power to also give momentum to the NPT.
12. In addition, Thailand greatly values its close relationship with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and engagement with other
international agencies and frameworks, lilce the Nuclear Security Contact Group,
the CTBTO, and the UN Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004). We support
such cooperation efforts as they can further strengthen the NPT and more
effectively advance the goal of international peace and security.
Mr. Chair,
13. We are all concerned with today's ever-changing security landscape.
Though we welcome the thaw in tensions in the Korean Peninsula, as well as the
renewed willingness for dialogue between the relevant stakeholders, the threat of
nuclear weapons in our region still remains. That being said, it is necessary for the
NPT to be relevant, forceful, and dynamic in order to help us address such threats,
as well as anticipate those we may face in the future. If we can take our reflections
from this Preparatory Committee and turn them into actions, we will surely be
better placed to tackle such security challenges.
14. A more robust NPT can allow for achievement on an even wider scale.
There are clear connections between disarmament, peace and security, and
development, as one makes room for the next. If the international community
hopes to realize the Sustainable Development Goals, achieving peace and security
through disarinament and non-proliferation is certainly a requisite factor to which
the NPT can contribute. And as the IAEA can attest, the peaceful applications of
nuclear technology can benefit food security, public health, water management,
energy, and many other global issues. These potential positive contributions to the
SDGs should inspire us to work harder to realize a successful NPT.
15. Thailand hopes that we will have substantive and fruitful deliberations
during this Preparatory Committee, with constructive and open participation from
all States Parties, as we work toward our common goal of international peace and
security and a world free from nuclear weapons.
I thank you, Mr. Chair.
