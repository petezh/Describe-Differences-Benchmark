Chairperson,
Like your predecessor , you have invested time and energy in the pre-preparatory process for the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Review Conference of the State Parties to the NPT. As my delegation congratulates you on your assumptions of the Chair, please rest assured ojrour cooperation for a successful conclusion of our deliberation.
My delegation associate itself with the Statement delivered by the Ambassador of Indonesia on behalf of the NAM State Parties to the NPT.
Chairperson,
We have embarked on a process aimed at ensuring that atoms of mass annihilation are transformed into atoms for peace and prosperity and that, what humanity sadly experienced in 1945 will never be repeated again. We need to constantly remind ourselves of the untold and endless death and suffering that can emanate from the use of nuclear weapons. In this connection, we applaud the ongoing efforts in furthering disarmament and non-proliferation education.
Namibia believes that upholding equally all the three pillars of the treaty, is the most viable means of achieving nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. In this context, my delegation wishes to reiterate that multilateral setting through the NPT provides security for all, Nuclear and Non-nuclear Weapons States. It therefore follows that all State Parties, especially the Nuclear Weapons States, have special responsibilities to prevent the spread of Nuclear Weapons and relevant technology and promote cooperation for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and enhance nuclear disarmament.
As the Sessions of the Preparatory Committee are meant to assess the implementation of each article of the NPT and facilitate discussions among States with a view to making recommendations to the Review Conference in 2010, Namibia fully subscribe to the objectives of nuclear non-proliferation and arms control.
My delegation would like to reaffirm its firm position, that the universality of the NPT cannot be realized amidst regionalized proliferation.

As a State Party which is member of NAM, the African Union which already in 1964 has declared the denuclearization of Africa, Namibia remains committed to the full
implementation of the NPT. In this context, we draw paramount attention to the Algiers Declaration which, while recalling the Pelindaba Treaty, reaffirms the universal adherence to the NPT and the IAEA Safeguards regime reiterates the balance and non-selective implementation of the NPT provisions and stresses the primary role of the IAEA in the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear sustainable development and verification. The right of State Parties to nuclear peaceful is thus integral to the Treaty.

Chairperson,	
We recall that among the issues addressed at the NPT al the 2000 NPT Conference was the early into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. With 178 States Signatories and 144 having ratified, the international community has|£puple proof of its support for the CTBT. The treaty's early entry into force would greatly enhance the international regime for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. In this connection we urge all countries that have not yet do so, especially those listed in Annex 2, to sign and ratify the CTBT.
Chairperson,
The issue of Nuclear Fuel supply is of paramount importance to all States Parties to the NPT. Taking into consideration the complexity of this concept and its technical, legal, commercial and economic ramifications, my delegation believes that the views of all Member States should be taken into account and comprehensive and transparent consultations should precede any substantive consideration.
Chairperson,
In conclusion, let me reiterate that we must resist the temptation to create an impression or act in a manner that there are good or bad nuclear weapons. Nuclear disarmament is serious business and there can be no room for selectivity or double standards. Nuclear are just that-Weapons of Mass Destruction. And Selective disarmament is tantamount to nuclear proliferation.
Thank you
