
Mr. President,
First of all I would like to congratulate you on your election as President of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. My delegation is convinced that under your able leadership, we can look forward to achieving some positive outcome from our deliberations, despite the daunting task ahead of you. We have been greatly inspired by your comprehensive and inspiring inaugural statement. My delegation would also like to congratulate the Members of the Bureau
The 2000 Review Conference, meeting at the commencement of the new millennium, is a milestone in the history of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. It has provided us with the opportunity to evaluate the past efforts since the indefinite extension of NPT in 1995 and to identity new areas where we can achieve progress. It is also an important occasion for us to renew our collective commitment made at the 1995 review conference and to further strengthen the review process for the Treaty. 
Mr. President,
Myanmar is strongly in favour of nuclear disarmament and is fully committed to its realization. As such my delegation hopes to see some progress towards nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation at this review conference.
Since the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995, except for the conclusion of the CTBT, the world has yet to witness tangible achievements regarding the implementation of the principles and objectives set forth in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Despite some progress among the nuclear-weapon States on the unilateral and bilateral levels to reduce their nuclear armaments, the world is still menaced with the perils of nuclear arsenals. Two of the threshold states have established their de-facto nuclear weapon-state status by conducting nuclear tests putting a serious setback to the non-proliferation regime. Despite the fact that CTBT is enjoying growing international support two nuclear-weapon States have yet to ratify the Treaty. At this juncture, we need to build a stronger international consensus to discourage any new development of nuclear weapons and to dismantle more of the existing ones. My delegation believes that the nuclear-power States should take the lead in setting this example through demonstration of political will.
On the brighter side of the disarmament spectrum, my delegation would like to welcome the ratification of START II and CTBT by the Russian Federation. These positive actions by the Russian government constitute a step forward to the realization of disarmament goals. The ratification of START II opens up new opportunities for the commencement of negotiations on START III. 
Mr. President,
I would now like to turn to some of the issues which my delegation considers it to be important. At the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, my delegation submitted some proposals for consideration to be incorporated in the document on principles and objectives and a programme of action (POPA) on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. I would here like to reiterate some of these issues. 
Mr. President,
My delegation is of the view that universal adherence to the NPT remains to be an urgent priority. Accordingly, all States not yet party to the Treaty should be called upon to accede to the Treaty at the earliest possible date. In this regard, my delegation considers that effective measures for nuclear disarmament will contribute towards the realization of the goal of the universality of adherence to the Treaty.
Since the continuing existence of nuclear weapons poses a great danger to mankind and the best and the only genuinely effective defence against a nuclear catastrophe is the total elimination of these weapons, the States Parties should reaffirm their firm commitment to the process of total elimination of nuclear weapons. In this regard, the early establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee on nuclear disarmament in the Conference on Disarmament is urgently called for.
My delegation is of the view that for the full realization of the nuclear disarmament, the early entry into force of the CTBT is an important measure. It is also important to commence negotiations on the fissile material cut-off treaty at the earliest possible date and to have it concluded as soon as possible. Although my delegation welcomes the decision to establish of the Ad Hoc Committee, it is regrettable to learn that negotiations on FMCT have not yet started at the Conference on Disarmament. My delegation considers that agreements should also be reached on other crucial arms control measures for the reduction of nuclear danger such as de-alerting and deactivating nuclear weapons and a joint undertaking by the Nuclear Weapon States not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. 
Mr. President,
The total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only genuine guarantee for non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. We are, therefore, of the view that pending the achievement of such a goal, a legally binding international instrument on a security assurances regime which will ensure the security of non-nuclear-weapon states against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons should be urgently concluded.
The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the states of the region concerned enhances global and regional peace and security. In this respect, the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in their respective regions by the Treaties of Tlatelolco, Rarotonga, Bangkok and Pelindaba have gone a long way in limiting the geographic proliferation of nuclear weapons and in enhancing global and regional peace and security. However, the cooperation of all the Nuclear Weapon States and their respect and support for the respective protocols are necessary for the maximum effectiveness of nuclear-weapon-free zones and their respective protocols. My delegation would therefore like to call upon the States Parties to express their desire to see an early entry into force of the protocols which still remain to be ratified by the Nuclear Weapon States through the resolution of the remaining issues in a spirit of amity and cooperation in the shortest possible time. 
Mr. President,
These are in a nutshell some of the issues which my delegation submitted at the Third Prepcom. My delegation looks forward to further discussing them and also on other issues relating to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament which may arise during the course of our deliberations. Before concluding, I would like to reaffirm Myanmar's commitment to the NPT regime and to associate ourselves with the statement made by Indonesia on behalf of NAM. My delegation would also like to assure you of our fullest co-operation to make this conference a success. 
Thank you.
