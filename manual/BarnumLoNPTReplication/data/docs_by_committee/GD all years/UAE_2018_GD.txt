Second Session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2020 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Geneva, 23 April - 4 May, 2018 General Debate 
UAE statement Delivered by H.E. Ambassador Hamad ALKAABI Permanent Representative of the UAE to UN and International Organizations in Vienna 
Mr. President, 
At the outset, allow me to congratulate you on your assumption of the chairmanship for the second Preparatory Committee for the 2020 NPT review conference. My delegation offers its full support and cooperation towards achieving a successful meeting. UAE aligns itself with the statement delivered on behalf of NPDI countries, and the statements conveyed by NAM and the Arab Group. 
Mr. President, 
My delegation extends its full support and optimism towards a fruitful and constructive review cycle, particularly in the aftermath of the 2015 Review Conference's failure to reach a consensus outcome. 
UAE remains committed to continued efforts to achieve and maintain a world free of the threat posed by nuclear weapons, and encourages all steps towards strengthening global peace and security. My country is of the view that the NPT provides an effective framework for the establishment of an international nuclear non-proliferation regime, and serves as a prominent platform for the development of nuclear energy in a responsible manner. 
Mr, President, 
UAE has progressed well in the development of its nuclear power programme with 4 nuclear power reactors under advanced stages of construction in my country, the construction of the first unit is now

completed. In doing so, my country complies fully with its international obligations and has developed its programme in line with the highest standards of safety, security and non-proliferation. In working closely with the IAEA, the UAE nuclear energy programs is considered a model for many countries wishing to embark on a a peaceful and responsible nuclear power programme of their own. Through the platform of the IAEA, the UAE shares its experience and best practices with other Member States. In 2017, my country hosted the IAEA's International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Power in the 21st Century. The Conference was instrumental in providing a forum for high-level dialogue on the significant role of nuclear energy leading into the future. The Conference further emphasized the crucial role of the IAEA in guiding States that develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to do so in a responsible and safe manner. The role of the Agency should continue to be strengthened so that adequate support can be afforded to Member States in this scope. 
Mr. President, 
UAE recognizes the prominent challenges that the global non-proliferation regime faces today, and notes the urgency for implementing measures to strengthen the NPT. We should not fall short of ensuring that progress is being made across all three pillars of the Treaty. My country considers it the right of every state party to the NPT to develop nuclear energy for peaceful uses, and notes that all nuclear programmes should, from their outset, remain transparent, peaceful and compliant with IAEA standards, As such, we expect all nuclear programmes to fall under the full verification measures of the IAEA safeguards and to extend confidence to the global community by addressing relevant international concerns. In this regard, the UAE continues to view Iran's cooperation with the IAEA is essential, and hope that Iran fully implement its obligation under the Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the IAEA safeguards and the NPT. We encourage Iran to further address all regional and internationals concerns and to comply effectively with the IAEA on the verification and monitoring of its nuclear activities and to provide sufficient assurances on the exclusive peaceful nature of its program to its neighbors and the global community

Mr. Chairman,

My country is of the view that the Additional Protocol to the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement is an important instrument to complement the IAEA safeguards system, and encourages States parties to utilize this instrument to fortify the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
Mr. President, 
Referring to nuclear disarmament, the UAE affords utmost importance to the total elimination of nuclear weapons, as called for by the NPT. The UAE is deeply committed to enforcing the nuclear test ban regime, and as such, encourages the entry into force of the CTBT without further delay. The CTBT entry into force is an important element of the global nuclear disarmament regime. In light of this, the UAE has strongly condemned the continued development and testing of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles by North Korea. The North Korean nuclear weapon programme undermines the global non-proliferation regime and threatens regional stability and international security . 
Mr. President, 
My delegation emphasizes that robust efforts must be taken by the international community towards universalization of the NPT. In this context, UAE renews its call for States non-party to join the Treaty without delay. 
The UAE considers that the establishment of a Middle East nuclear weapons and other WMD free zone is a priority and long due step the establishment of such zone will support the objectives of the NPT and will contribute positively to regional and international security. We hope this Review Cycle will achieve significant steps towards the realization of the agreed action plan of 2010 and the convening of a conference on the Middle East nuclear weapons free zone, at an early stage, and with the participation of all countries in the region.
