Mr. President,
At the outset allow me to join others who have spoken before me to congratulate you on your election as President of the 2005 Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear weapons. With your rich and vast experience, this Conference should be successful. I wish to assure you of my delegation's full support and cooperation.
My delegation associates itself with the statement made by Malaysia on behalf the Non-Aligned Movement.
Mr. President,
We are meeting again to review the operation of the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the cornerstone of global non- proliferation and nuclear disarmament. A decade has passed since the 1995 Review Conference, which extended the Treaty indefinitely, and adopted the decisions on Strengthening the Review Process for the Treaty and Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament. Also five years have passed since our historic 2000 Review Conference at which, among other issues, nuclear-weapon States unequivocally undertook to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals.
In 2000, we also agreed on 13 practical steps for the systematic and progressive efforts to achieve the complete elimination of nuclear weapons pursuant with Article VI of the NPT. Regrettably, the thirteen practical steps have not been implemented and there is no evidence of efforts to implement them. The 13 steps have become a dead letter. The Treaty and commitments arising from it ought to be honoured in letter and spirit. We strongly believe that the future of the NPT rests on its implementation and the 13 practical steps is a useful and feasible way of moving forward.
Mr. President,
The NPT has been passing through its greatest challenges over the past few years, with its integrity under enormous stress. Nuclear-weapon States continue to rely on the doctrine of nuclear deterrence as they upgrade the lethality of the weapons and precision of their delivery systems. The world is not safer now from the threat of nuclear weapons than it then was. To make matters worse, the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons has now been lowered. Nuclear weapons can now be used as tactical weapons in a purely conventional war against a non- nuclear-weapon State.
North Korea's withdrawal from the Treaty in January 2003 was clearly one of its biggest setbacks since its entry into force. We have also witnessed illegal transfer of nuclear technology by individuals and non-state networks. All this does not augur well for the NPT and it seems that the indefinite extension has not brought about the expected positive results. The world needs to be shown in a transparent and verifiable manner that nuclear weapons are being eliminated irreversibly.
There is no dispute, however, that the NPT has played an important role in bringing about and consolidating international peace and security. The NPT remains the only disarmament agreement that enjoys near universality. Apart from North Korea, which withdrew from the Treaty in 2003, the number of nuclear weapon States has not increased among its membership. Only three countries with nuclear weapons remain outside the NPT. We call on those three countries to assure the rest of us of collective safety under the umbrella of the NPT.
Mr. President,
Tanzania is fully committed to the objectives of the NPT and our commitment is demonstrated by our ratification of the Pelindaba Treaty which establishes the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. We have also ratified the CTBT and signed the IAEA Additional Protocol in conformity with our obligations under the Treaty. Only two weeks ago, the Parliament of the United Republic of Tanzania passed legislation ratifying the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. Terrorism could be a new front for nuclear proliferation if it is not curbed decisively and collectively in a timely manner.
Mr. President,
We wish to emphasize the importance of the three pillars of the NPT, namely non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. These pillars give balance to the Treaty and as far as we are concerned, none has more weight than the other. We should therefore treat them with the same equanimity. Attempts to divide or de-link these pillars could have damaging impact on the Treaty. In the same vein, selectivity on the implementation of the Treaty could lead to the same consequences.
Since the 1995 Review Conference, there has been little progress on nuclear disarmament and therefore nothing much to be proud of.
Mr. President,
The role played by Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones in efforts towards nuclear disarmament cannot be overemphasized. Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones not only serve as instruments for strengthening peace and security, but also builds confidence among States. The Conference of States Parties and Signatories of Treaties that establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones that was held in Mexico City last week, has further demonstrated the determination by States from the relevant regions of their commitment to a world free of nuclear weapons.
Tanzania reaffirms its support for the establishment of Nuclear-Weapon- Free Zones on the basis of agreements among the States of the region concerned. In this respect, we wish to stress the importance and urgency for the establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East. The region is volatile and requires relevant States to reach an agreement on the establishment of a WMD free zone and to cooperate with the IAEA. We call upon Israel, the only State in the Middle East outside the NPT, to join the Treaty and place its nuclear facilities under full-scope IAEA's safeguards.
My delegation also hopes that an agreement will be concluded soon for the establishment of NWFZ in Central Asia. Tanzania also reaffirms her support for Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status.
Mr. President,
For a long time, NNWS have voiced their concern and called for assurances by the five nuclear-weapon States not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States that are States Parties to the NPT. This is viewed as a temporary measure pending the complete eradication of nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, there is reluctance on the part of NWS to offer such assurances to States that have formally renounced nuclear weapons. Once again, we call on NWS to honor their obligation and conclude a legally binding agreement on negative security assurances. Signatures to the Protocols establishing NWFZ are not adequate and are in no way legally binding.
Mr. President,
We wish to underscore the importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency in its enhancement of nuclear safety. Its contribution to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament through its safeguards and verification deserves our appreciation. We should offer the IAEA the necessary human resources and financial support to enable it to perform better. This, of course, includes the need for all States Parties to sign the Additional Protocol as called for under Article III. Our ultimate goal should be the universalization of the Additional Protocols as proposed by the 2000 Review Conference.
We wish, however, to reaffirm the inalienable right of States Parties to develop research, production and use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes without discrimination. Export controls on material, equipment and technology though obligatory for any NPT party, have been biased against developing countries. This trend denies developing countries the necessary science and technology to achieve development in various fields.
Mr. President,
Tanzania takes note of nuclear-tests moratorium maintained by NWS. Nevertheless, self-imposed or unilateral moratorium does not provide any guarantee against future testing. It is for this reason that my delegation believes that the only guarantee is the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). This was one of the objectives of the 1995 Review Conference. It is regrettable, however, that the CTBT has not entered into force for lack of ratification by 11 of the required 44 nuclear-capable States before it can enter into force.
We consider the CTBT to be a vital component of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We believe that the CTBT stands to play a key role in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Its early entry into force is therefore crucial and we should strive to make this happen. In this context, we call upon all States that have not done so to ratify the Treaty as soon as possible, particularly those States whose ratification is a prerequisite for the Treaty to enter into force.
Mr. President,
In conclusion, I wish to emphasize that it is crucial that this Conference concludes with a positive outcome. Tanzania believes that every State Party to the Treaty has an obligation to make sure that the Conference succeeds. This is one area which is crucial in realizing freedom from fear as outlined in the Secretary General's document - "In Larger Freedom" as key in reforming the United Nations for enhanced international peace and security.
I thank you.
