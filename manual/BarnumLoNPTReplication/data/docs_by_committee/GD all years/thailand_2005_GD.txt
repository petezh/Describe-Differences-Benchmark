Mr. President,
Let me, at the outset, join other delegations in congratulating you on your election to preside over this Conference. My delegation also wishes to extend our congratulations to the members of the Bureau on their election. We believe that with your experience, wise guidance and able leadership as well as flexibility of all of us here, this conference will lead to a successful outcome. My delegation pledges our full support and cooperation to you throughout the next three weeks.
Thailand wishes to also associate yourself with the statement delivered last week by H.E. Mr. Syed Hamid Albar, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia, on behalf of the Non-Aligned States Parties to the NPT.
Mr. President,
Since our last Review Conference in 2000, a lot of developments have taken place and have shaped the international political and security environment, which, to a large extent, affect the NPT regime. On a positive side, the recent accessions to the NPT of Cuba and Timor-Leste have been another step towards the universality of the Treaty. My delegation is also pleased to observe other significant positive developments, such as the decision of Libya to renounce its weapon of mass destruction programme; the further institutionalization of Mongolia's free nuclear weapon status; the ongoing negotiations to resolve the Iran's nuclear programme between France, Germany and the United Kingdom and Iran; and the recent adoption by the General Assembly of the long-negotiated International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.
On the negative side, however, a number of incidents have posed a serious threat to the integrity of the NPT and the broader nuclear disarmament and non- proliferation regime. Among others, this includes the withdrawal from the Treaty and a claim to possess a handful of nuclear weapons of DPRK; the revelation of the A.Q.Khan's black market nuclear supply network; acts of terrorism throughout the world which raise concern about nuclear and other WMD terrorism; and the tack of the progress in the implementation of the 13 Practical Steps towards the elimination of nuclear arsenals on which all of us here agreed at our last Review Conference.
Like others, my delegation shares the concern that brought about by these negative developments, which generate divergent views as to the courses of action to be taken to effectively cope with these challenges - whether disarmament measures should be implemented as a prerequisite to non-proliferation measures or the other way around. These divergent perceptions have unfortunately stalemated the discussion in disarmament and non-proliferation forum, and would once again affect this Conference. We simply cannot continue on like this.
In my delegation's views, both disarmament and non-proliferation should be addressed constructively on an equal footing, and deserve the same level of attention. Simply put, both nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states have equal responsibility to carry out our roles in disarmament and non- proliferation.
Mr. President,
As a non-nuclear weapon state, Thailand has a firm policy not to develop, acquire or proliferate, test or transfer nuclear weapons. We value the importance of NPT in preventing proliferation of nuclear weapons, promoting disarmament and supporting peaceful use of nuclear energy. We are fully committed to all obligations under the NPT, in particular those relating to non-proliferation aspect, and strongly supports bilateral, regional and multilateral efforts and agreement on non- proliferation. Thailand not only supports the implementation of the UNSC Resolution 1540, but has also rendered full cooperation to other friendly countries in opposing the nuclear proliferation and illicit trafficking, and in strengthening capacity building on export controls. We fully agree with the need to prevent Non- State actors and terrorist groups from acquiring nuclear and radioactive materials for non-peaceful uses. In this regard, we are expediting our administrative process so as to accede to the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear materials as soon as possible.
Mr. President,
Turning now to the safeguard system of the IAEA, Thailand considers the Additional Protocol as a confidence-building measure and an effective international verification system to provide assurances of peaceful uses and legal transactions of nuclear equipment and dual-uses. We also see the merit of making the Additional Protocol a new verification standard. For our part, we are finalizing our domestic procedures to sign the Additional Protocol with a view to acceding to it when our constitutional requirements for entry into force have been met. As a country benefiting from uses of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, Thailand supports the right of all states to develop the research, production and utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination, as provided under Article IV. We also support technical cooperation activities of IAEA in promoting and transfer of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
Mr. President,
As the Comprehensive-Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is a reinforcing measure for the NPT, my delegation attaches great importance to Us early entry into force. In this regard, my delegation calls upon all states that have not signed or ratified the CTBT, particularly the 11 remaining states listed in the Annex II of the Treaty, to do so without delay. As for Thailand, we are in the process of completing our internal process to ratify and expecting to become a State Party to the CTBT by the end of next year.
While the total elimination of nuclear weapons is yet to be achieved, my delegation views that a conclusion of a universal, unconditional and legally binding instrument on negative security assurances to non-nuclear weapon States would create a climate of trust among States Parties to the NPT. Therefore, my delegation supports, as a matter of urgency, the codification of the security assurances, which is also in line with the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the "Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons".
Mr. President,
My delegation views that nuclear weapon free zones is one of the most important non-proliferation measures and means of achieving complete disarmament. My delegation sees the need for strengthened cooperation among the established nuclear weapon-free zones and, in this context, welcomes the outcome of the Conference of States Parties and Signatories of Treaties that establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free- Zones, held in Mexico last two weeks.
We support the establishment on nuclear-weapon-free zones in every region, including the ones in Central Asia, South Asia and the Middle East. Together with the other member countries of ASEAN, Thailand has established the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones (SEANWFZ), and has cooperated actively in the field of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. My delegation urges the nuclear weapon states to accede to the Protocol to the SEANWFZ Treaty and, in this regard, welcomes the readiness of China to sign the Protocol.
Mr. President,
As for the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT, my delegation stresses the importance of the return of the DPRK to the non-proliferation regime and urges the DPRK to consider the resumption of Safeguards Activities under the Treaty. My delegation also supports a peaceful solution under the framework of Six-Party-Talks and a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula.
Mr. President,
In conclusion, the validity and strength of the NPT depends highly on our political will. We need to engage in frank and constructive dialogue. This conference now provides us with such an opportunity. It is my delegation's hope that during the next three weeks, we could set aside our preoccupations and be able to reach agreement on concrete steps. We need to ensure that the existing obligations under the Treaty and all previous review conferences will be fulfilled, and new menaces confronting the Treaty will be addressed effectively. We cannot afford to do otherwise if we want to restore confidence and credibility back to the NPT and if we want to make NPT relevant to our people back home.
I thank you, Mr. President.
