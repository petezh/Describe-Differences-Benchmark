Mr. President,
I would like to take this opportunity to extend to you my congratulations on your election as President of the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). My delegation is confident that your experience and knowledge of the matter will be of great help for the successful completion of this extremely important forum. Please allow me to congratulate also the other members of the Bureau and to assure you that you can fully count on the support of my delegation.
Bulgaria fully aligns itself with the statement, delivered last week by the distinguished Representative of Luxembourg, on behalf of the European Union. This is why in my statement today I would like to confine myself to some points of particular interest to my country.
Mr. President,
The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remains a cornerstone of the nuclear non proliferation regime and a foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. Since its inception it has served as a milestone of the efforts of the international community to safeguard the international peace and security. Nowadays it is necessary more than ever to reconfirm its significance as a constant stabilizing factor and not to allow any infringement on its integrity. We fully support the view that addressing adequately the three pillars of the Treaty is of a particular importance for the achievement of a balanced outcome of this Conference.
Mr. President,
My country fully shares the concern that over the past years we have witnessed an increased risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery at global and regional levels. One of the major threats, in this regard, is that non-state actors, terrorists in particular, may gain access to nuclear, radiological, chemical and biological weapons and sensitive material and put them to use with unprecedented consequences. These threats should be addressed through active and consolidated actions on the part of the international community so as not to allow even a minimum chance for success of terrorists.
For the achievement of these goals Bulgaria accords high priority to the effective implementation of Resolution 1540. We consider that by an establishing of an effective national export control system as well as by its participation in all multilateral export control regimes Bulgaria contributes actively, commensurate with its capacities, to successfully withstand this challenge. My country has increased the level of its practical cooperation in this field by joining recently the PSI.
Bulgaria firmly believes that the strict compliance with all NPT norms and its universalization are vital factors in the same direction. The question of withdrawal is an issue that has to be considered with a sense of urgency at this forum. We stand ready to discuss any constructive proposal to this end.
We hope that the Conference should reaffirm the commitments stemming from Article III of the NPT for all States-Parties to conclude safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Being among the first states to sign and ratify the Additional Protocol to the Agreement on the Implementation of the Safeguards in connection with the NPT, Bulgaria calls for its universalization and fully supports the appeal to have it approved as an indispensable verification norm.
Mr. President,
It is regrettable that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) has not yet entered into force. My country regards the CTBT as one of the major instruments for the strengthening of the non-proliferation and disarmament regime. Bearing this in mind, we call upon the Conference to reconfirm its significance. Bulgaria calls on all states, which have not yet signed and ratified it to accede to it as early as possible.
The immediate start of negotiations on a non-discriminatory and comprehensive fissile material cut-off treaty is imperative in view of the further strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime.
The nuclear free zones play an important part in safeguarding regional peace and security. We regard them as additional instruments which might contribute to confidence building and could be implemented with positive results in various regions. Within this context we express our support for the transformation of the Middle East into a nuclear weapons free zone.
Mr. President,
I would like to conclude by pledging the full support of the Bulgarian delegation for your efforts to achieve successful outcome of this Conference.
Thank you!
