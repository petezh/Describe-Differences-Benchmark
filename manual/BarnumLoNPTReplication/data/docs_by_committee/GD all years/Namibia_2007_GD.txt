Chairperson,
At the outset, my delegation extends to you our congratulations tor your assumption of the chairmanship of the First Session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Review Conference of the State Parties to the NPT. My delegation would like to assure you of its full cooperation during the proceedings of this session, for a successful conclusion.
Chairperson,
At the opening of this First Session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Review Conference of the State Parties to the NPT, we together rose in silence to pay tribute to former Mayor Itoh of Nagasaki. We did so to honor him for his relentless efforts for nuclear disarmament, but equalh important, we did so to remind ourselves of the untold and endless suffering that can emanate from nuclear weapons, and thus the urgency and seriousness we all need to infuse into our deliberation and subsequent actions.
At this juncture, my delegation aligns itself fully with the statement delivered by the distinguished Ambassador of Cuba on behalf of the Group of NAM State Parties to the NPT. We also welcome the message 10 this First Session of Prepcom, by the Secretary General of the UN, Mr. Ban Ki Moon.
Chairperson,
The record of the NPT Review Conference has been mixed. There has been successes and sadly, there continues to be setbacks. Despite the divergence of views there is growing and undisputable recognition, that the multilateral setting through the NPT provides security for all, Nuclear and Non-nuclear Weapon States. The indefinite extension of the Treaty in May 1995 appeared initial to offer a chance for a new beginning in nuclear disbarment. Thirteen
years down the road, we are yet to see the tangible results. The 2005 Review-Conference of the parties to the treaty, was unable to produce a substantive outcome on the review of the implementation of the provisions o f the treaty, in the Disarmament Commission no real progress on nuclear disarmament and key states continue to refuse to ratify the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, At the same time, the number of Nuclear Weapons States has increased. It seems to us, that the Nuclear Weapon States are preoccupied with proliferations of nuclear weapons, but not with nuclear disarmament, as they are perfecting their nuclear arsenal.
We will recall that among the issues addressed at the 2000 NPT Review-Conference was the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Furthermore, the 2005 Review Conference was to strengthen the Treaty by agreeing to measures to reinforce compliance with both non-proliferation and disarmament obligations. My delegation is cognizant of the number of steps taken but remain concerned about the failures of the CTBT to enter into force.
Chairperson,
This is the reality we face today. The objective of the NPT cannot be realized by implementing its provisions selectively, neither can the universality of the NPT be realized amidst regionalized proliferation. As a State Party to the NPT, Namibia subscribes to the objectives for Non-proliferation and disarmament as enshrined in the NPT, as we believe it represents the only binding commitment to the goal of nuciear non-proliferation and disarmament. It therefore follows that all States Parties especially the Nuclear Weapon States have special responsibilities to prevent the spread of Nuclear Weapons and the relevant technology and promote cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to pursue negotiations in good faith on nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control.
Chairperson,
Namibia remains committed to implement its obligations assumed under the NPT provisions. In this context, that we attach great importance to the Algiers Declaration which, while recalling the Pelindaba Treaty, re-affirmed the universal adherence to the NPT and IAEA Safeguards regime, reiterates the balance and non-selective implementation of the NPT provisions and
stresses the primary role of the IAEA in the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy for sustainable development. The right of State Parties to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy is thus integral to the Treat).
Chairperson,
While fully aware of the challenges faced by the State Parties to the NPT to find a far reaching consensus on the three pillars of the Treaty. We strongly believe that all the provision of the treaty are equally important, thus they must be implemented in a manner which does not create the impression of selectivity. In this context, Namibia is concerned about the ability of some States not Parties to the Treaty to obtain, from some Nuclear Weapon Slates nuclear materials, technology and know-how to develop Nuclear Weapons.
Nuclear disarmament is serious business and there can be no room for selectivity or double standards. Nuclear weapons are just that Weapons of Mass Destruction. And selective disarmament is tantamount to nuclear proliferation.
