Mr, President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates/
At the outset let me thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Director-General of the IAEA for their steadfastness in supporting the Non-proliferation regime. We are gathered once again, to take a critical look at our collective efforts in bringing about non-proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world and take stock of the progress made since 2000. A lot has happened since the last attempt at a review in 2005. The Gambia has also signed the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and we will make efforts to consider the ratification of other treaties in this regime.
Mr. President,
The Gambia is a party to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and the Pelindaba Treaty (African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone) and we are indeed very glad that the latter has now come into force. It is our hope that our commitments, as African Governments, towards establishing a true Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone would be actively supported by the International Community. Our commitment to the realization of this zone is anchored in Africa's commitment to international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. African countries including The Gambia that are endowed with uranium resources are only interested in properly harnessing these resources for peaceful uses. We believe that the early establishment of the African Commission on Nuclear Energy would equally encourage the peaceful uses of nuclear energy on the continent
Mr. President,
My delegation envisages a stronger relationship of cooperation with the IAEA as it expands its technical cooperation programmes with African countries In the fields of education, health, medicine and agriculture. We would like to see greater support for the IAEA's EDUCARE (Education for Cancer in Africa) project as one Important avenue in deepening cooperation with, and support to Sub-Saharan African Governments, in our drive to halt the growing epidemic of cancer. The agency's Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) should be generously supported so that it can be replicated in a good number of countries.
Mr. President,
A country like The Gambia with its own medical school and technology hospital, would like to be a part of the regional training networks envisaged for cancer control and also benefit from the resources of the Virtual University for Cancer Control VUCCnet). We know that our healthcare workers can benefit from training in the treatment and diagnosis of cancer. Networking with African Universities would be an important entry point for instituting sustained cooperation in the promotion of modern medical technologies and radiotherapy.
Mr. President,
The peaceful use of nuclear technology has a great potential for solving a lot of development problems faced by developing countries especially the use of nuclear techniques in developing improved soil, water and nutrient management practices. This would have a major impact on food security in areas like sub-Saharan Africa.
Mr. President,
We are of the conviction that any reduction in the production of nuclear weapons could lead to the freeing up of substantial resources for peaceful uses. We therefore call on Nuclear-Weapon States, to recommit themselves to enhancing the non-proliferation regime anchored in the NPT. A lot more needs to be done by those states to their side of the bargain and it is incumbent upon them to respect the rights of other states to the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. Nuclear technology cannot be the preserve of the few.
For this reason, we support the legitimate quest of all states parties to the NPT who want to benefit from nuclear technology and they need to be assured that their rights under the regime would be respected at all times.
Mr. President,
The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free one in the Middle East is still outstanding. The question of Israeli's nuclear capabilities is closely linked to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and the question of lasting peace in the region. We therefore encourage the Director-General of the IAEA to redouble his efforts in following up on the resolutions in this regard.
Mr. President,
We must all commit ourselves to ridding our planet of nuclear weapons and replacing them with technologies that promote the advancement of humanity and not its destruction. The NPT regime must be supported by all and the IAEA must be generously supported, especially in the work that it does in developing countries.
Thank you.
