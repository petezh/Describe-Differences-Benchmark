Statement by
H.E. Mr Robert G. Aisi
Permanent Representative/ Ambassador
of Papua New Guinea to the United Nations
to the
2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
30 April 2015
__________________________________________________________________________
Madam President,
I join the preceding speakers in conveying my delegation's deep condolences and sympathies to
the Government and the people of Nepal as they deal with the tragic loss of life and livelihoods
impacted by last Saturday's devastating earthquake and aftershocks. Our thoughts and prayers
are with the people of Nepal and we believe that the resilient spirit of the people of Nepal and
with the assistance of the international community will help the country on the path to
recovery, rehabilitation and restoration.
Madam President,
I congratulate you on your assumption of the Presidency of the NPT Review Conference and likewise
for the Bureau members, who also have our support and cooperation as you lead our important
work.
Papua New Guinea remains fully committed to the NPT and the noble goal of the total and
irreversible elimination of nuclear weapons. We strongly agree with the Secretary-General that this
must continue to be a top priority for the United Nations and its member States, as this is consistent
with the spirit of the core pillars of the UN Charter, particularly regarding the preservation and
advancement of international peace and security.
The existence of a multitude of nuclear weapons in the world today poses a serious threat to
international peace and security and, indeed, the very survival of humanity. We must all reinvigorate
our collective efforts to rid the world of these Weapons of Mass Destruction, which continue to cast
a dark and ominous shadow of obliteration and death for humanity.
My delegation, like many others, is deeply concerned that little progress has been made towards
disarmament since the last NPT Review Conference in 2010. All NPT nuclear-weapons States are
investing in the modernization of their nuclear armaments with the clear intention of retaining them
for many more decades. This runs counter to the NPT Article 6 obligations.
Madam President,
On a more positive note, the international community's recent focus on the humanitarian impacts of
nuclear weapons has brought much needed energy to the discussions on nuclear disarmament.
Papua New Guinea is pleased to associate with the joint statement on this issue delivered earlier this
week by Austria.
As the UN High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, Angela Kane, said in her opening remarks at
this year’s session of UN Disarmament Commission, with reference to Humanitarian initiative: “This
movement is supported by almost 80 percent of UN member States. The numbers cannot be
ignored”.
Papua New Guinea also supports the pledge issued at the Vienna Conference on the Humanitarian
Impact of Nuclear Weapons in December 2014 to fill the legal gap for the prohibition and elimination
of nuclear weapons not yet outlawed.
My delegation is pleased to have participated at the Second Conference on the Humanitarian Impact
of Nuclear Weapons, held in Nayarit, Mexico, in February 2014. We also reaffirm our unwavering
support for the call made at that Conference and reiterated at the Vienna Conference to start the
diplomatic process to negotiate a legally binding instrument prohibiting nuclear weapons.
Papua New Guinea and our neighbours in the South Pacific region have already prohibited nuclear
weapons at the regional level through the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone under the
Treaty of Raratonga. We must now work together to make the world a nuclear-weapon-free zone by
concluding a nuclear weapons ban treaty.
We also the welcome the dialogue between members of the P5+1 and Iran in recent months over
nuclear non-proliferation as a positive development. However, we do recognize and respect the
sovereign rights of UN Member States to peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Madam President,
As part of our international obligation to fostering global efforts for nuclear non-proliferation,
Papua New Guinea is also working in close cooperation with the CTBTO Preparatory
Commission.

We presently host a radionuclide international monitoring station, which was recently
upgraded, as part of the global network establish by the United Nations to monitor and detect
atmospheric and underground nuclear weapons testing.
Madam President,
Papua New Guinea remains convinced that nuclear weapons pose an unacceptable threat to people
everywhere. What we need is to see the divestment of resources in this area and redirect it to the
sustainable development of humanity rather than preparing Armageddon.
In conclusion, I wish to pay special thanks to the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki who have travelled to New York to participate in this Review Conference and to share their
heart-wrenching testimonies. Seven decades after their cities and homes were destroyed by this
weapons of mass destruction, they are still suffering the consequences and this is a stark reminder to
the world of the horrors of nuclear weapons.
As we prepare to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of the world's first-ever use of nuclear
weapons against mankind, let us use this solemn occasion to catalyse negotiations on a binding
international treaty that builds on the NPT by completely banning nuclear weapons. There is
absolutely no justification for having these obnoxious weapons in our midst.
I thank you.
