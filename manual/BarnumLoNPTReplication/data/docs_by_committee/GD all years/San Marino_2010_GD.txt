Allow me to congratulate you on your election. You can count on San Marino's full support.
Being one of the last speakers of the NPT General Debate, I am very pleased to have noticed the enthusiasm and resolution of so many Countries not only to improve the NPT, but, eventually, to eliminate the very existence of any atomic weapon.
Mr. President,
We applaud the commitment of President Obama and President Medvedev to substantially reduce their nations' nuclear arsenals. With their examples they are showing leaders hip.
San Marino, like so many small Countries, is looking for a consolidation and strengthening of the international non proliferation regime.
Unity of our will will be a strong indication of our desire to control and eventually eliminate the nuclear threat.
Mr. President,
We urge all the Countries that have not yet ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty to do so.
We praise those Countries that decided to establish and maintain nuclear free zones. I hope that their example will be followed by others in other dangerous parts of the globe.
We do need the nuclear energy, but we need it for pacific use to further develop our economic and social growth.
We are certain that the new technology will provide a safe development of future nuclear plants and of other much needed pacific applications.
Mr. President,
We urge all member States to support the effort of IAEA, reaffirming its authority and providing new resources to carry out its mission.
The NPT is a unique instrument for the maintenance of world peace and international security.
We must be determined to reconfirm our commitment for a world free of nuclear weapons.
I sincerely hope, Mr. President, that we will be able to achieve a substantial progress at this NPT Conference.
Thank you.
