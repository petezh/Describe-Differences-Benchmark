Mr. President,
May I first of all extend to you our congratulations upon your election as the President of the Review Conference. This Review Conference takes place at a critical juncture. The outcome of this Review Conference will have far reaching impact for the multilateral system in its endeavour to advance the work of arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation. My delegation wishes to assure you of our wholehearted support in your efforts to come up with a successful and substantive outcome.
My delegation fully associates itself with the statement made by the Hon. Syed Hamid Albar, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia on behalf of the Group of Non Aligned States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
Mr. President,
NPT is the corner stone of global arms control and non-proliferation efforts. It stands on three pillars, viz., nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear technology.
As we face new emerging threats of security challenges such as the proliferation of WMD and terrorism, it is more important than ever to acknowledge the need for the implementation of all three pillars of the NPT Treaty.
Nuclear Disarmament
Mr. President,
It bears reiteration that nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament must go hand in hand, as they are unquestionably two interdependent goals. It was based on this widely harboured conviction that the 2000 NPT Review Conference agreed on the Final Document, which included the unequivocal undertaking of the nuclear weapon States to eliminate their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament.
However, recent trends in the policies of some nuclear weapon States indicated that there were attempts to de-link the issue of nuclear non-proliferation from nuclear disarmament. All attention has been given to non-proliferation without paying due attention to disarmament. Horizontal non-proliferation is accorded greater emphasis than the vertical non-proliferation on the parts of some nuclear weapon States. Consequently, the issue of nuclear disarmament is facing great difficulty to occupy its rightful place in the agenda of multilateral disarmament negotiation forums. There is now a discernable inclination by some nuclear weapon States towards discarding the existing multilateral system in addressing non-proliferation and security issues. We believe that the multilateral framework such as Conference on Disarmament remains the best forum for negotiations on disarmament and non-proliferation.
Mr. President,
The International Court of Justice through its Advisory Opinion on 8 July 1996, unanimously concluded that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and to bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control. We continue to attach great importance to the Advisory Opinion.
Mr. President,
We reiterate our call for full implementation of the 13 Practical Steps outlined in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference for the systematic and progressive efforts to implement Article VI of the Treaty. These are the benchmarks with which we should assess the progress made by the nuclear weapon States to fulfill their commitments in the field of nuclear disarmament. However, an objective assessment of the implementation of these benchmarks shows virtually no progress. It must be stressed here that the indefinite extension of the NPT does not imply the indefinite possession by nuclear weapon States of their nuclear weapons arsenals.
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones
Mr. President,
Establishment of Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones is one of the yardsticks for measuring progress towards the full implementation of NPT. We also strongly share the belief that Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones contribute to the twin goals of non- proliferation and nuclear disarmament, goals that are dear to our hearts. We are therefore happy to see the gradual increase in number of States covered by the umbrella of Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaties. It is also our hope that in a not too distant future, we will witness the establishment of new nuclear-weapon-free zones in the regions where they do not exist, including in the Middle East. Myanmar welcomes the outcome of the Conference of States Parties and Signatories to the Treaties that establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones held in Mexico City from 26 to 28 April 2005. We commend Mexico for the initiative and hope that the outcome of the Conference will give a much needed positive impulse to our Review Conference.
Security Assurances
Mr. President,
Security assurances have been widely recognized as a key to strengthening the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. This issue has assumed greater importance and more urgency in the light of recent development.
We also wish to emphasize the importance of the policy of no first use of nuclear weapons and non-use and non-threat of use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon States. The 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference underscored the importance of this issue by stating, in its decision on Principles and Objectives, that further steps should be considered to assure non-nuclear weapon States Parties to the Treaty against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. It also explicitly mentioned that these steps could take the form of a legally binding multilateral instrument.
The 2000 NPT Review Conference has also agreed that legally binding security assurances by the five nuclear weapon States to the non-nuclear weapon States Parties to the NPT strengthen the non-proliferation regime. States who have voluntarily given up the nuclear weapon option not only deserves but have the legitimate right to receive security assurances. In this regard, Myanmar joins others in calling for the negotiation of a universal unconditional and legally binding instrument on security assurances.
Peaceful uses of Nuclear Technology
Mr. President,
The third pillar of the NPT Treaty is the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. My delegation wishes to stress here the inalienable right of all States to develop the research, production, and utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination, as well as the inviolability of nuclear facilities. We further reaffirm that the nuclear-weapon-free zones should not prevent the use of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes, as well as the essential character of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) technical cooperation activities in promoting the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and preventing the diversion of atomic energy for military purposes. In this regard, we underscore the important role of the IAEA in verifying that nuclear energy is only used for peaceful purposes.
Mr. President,
It is our hope that the outcome of the Review Conference will give positive impulse to the negotiations on disarmament, sustain and strengthen non-proliferation and promote peaceful use of nuclear technology with adequate safeguards. To achieve this, both nuclear-weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States must live up to their obligations. The Review Conference is the time and the place to demonstrate our commitments.
I thank you.
