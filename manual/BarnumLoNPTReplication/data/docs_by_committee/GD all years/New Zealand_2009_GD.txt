Mr Chairman,
Allow me at the outset to assure you of my delegation's full support for your endeavours at the helm of this Preparatory Committee meeting New Zealand will engage in an active and constructive manner in all efforts aimed at achieving agreement on an agenda for the Review Conference and on a set of elements to shape our discussions in 2010
On the key issue of nuclear disarmament, New Zealand supports strongly the views of the New Agenda Coalition, as expressed by the distinguished Representative from Sweden Creating a world free of nuclear weapons must remain at the forefront of our efforts to achieve a safer, more secure world
Mr Chairman,
The NPT underpins the international security architecture All NPT member States have a vested interest in and ownership of the Treaty and its operation One of the keys to the NPT's enduring nature is the equal importance attached to its three pillars - disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses. All elements of the "grand bargain" are deserving of equal weight in their implementation
The commitments made at past Review Conferences, freely agreed upon by all NPT member states, form an essentia! part of the NPT's fabric and its enduring nature The outcomes from the 1995 Review and Extension Conference and the 2000 Review Conference hold particular significance for New Zealand
Mr Chairman,
New Zealand is heartened by the renewed level of optimism on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation that has been evident in recent months It appears that the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation landscape may be on the cusp of positive change We are greatly encouraged by the expressions of support for a world free of nuclear weapons by both the nuclear weapon and non-nuclear weapon states
New Zealand warmly welcomes the statement by US President Obama in Prague outlining his government's commitment to move beyond Cold War thinking and to take a more balanced approach to all aspects of the NPT, including nuclear disarmament We also welcome the commitment made by Russian President Medvedev (as outlined by Foreign Minister Lavrov in his address to the Conference on Disarmament this year) to reaching the goal of a world free from nuclear weapons
The recent announcement by the US and Russia that they would commence negotiations on a new nuclear reductions agreement is of the utmost
significance We look forward to tangible progress and deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals
Most recently Foreign Minister Nakasone of Japan announced a three pillar eleven benchmark roadmap to a nuclear free world It contains much that resonates with New Zealand and we look forward to the international conference which Japan is planning to host early next year
Mr Chairman,
New Zealand has long held that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are mutually reinforcing We are pleased to play our part in combating the proliferation of nuclear weapons
Through our membership of the IAEA Board of Governors, which we embarked on for two years last October, we contribute to the non-proliferation effort We are an active member of the Proliferation Security Initiative We have implemented a robust set of export controls domestically aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear materials, equipment and technology
Mr Chairman,
Despite the positive signals of recent months, we face significant challenges There are complex verification issues which could pose a significant test for the Treaty They need to be met firmly by upholding the Treaty's integrity and reinforcing the authority of the safeguards system of the IAEA.
The IAEA Additional Protocol is a key tool and together with a comprehensive safeguards agreement forms the contemporary verification standard in New Zealand's view. New Zealand strongly urges all States Party which have not yet done so to conclude and to bring into force an Additional Protocol without delay
Like others, New Zealand remains concerned at the ongoing open questions that remain about the nature of Iran's nuclear programme We call on Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA, and comply without delay with all IAEA Board of Governors' decisions and UN Security Council resolutions New Zealand is also concerned at the lack of progress in the IAEA's inquiry in the Syrian Arab Republic and we urge Syria to offer its full co-operation to the IAEA in its work
The DPRK's nuclear weapons programme remains a serious challenge to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime as well as to peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and beyond New Zealand is disappointed that the DPRK has responded to international condemnation of its recent missile launch by expelling the IAEA's inspectors We urge the DPRK to rethink this decision and to re-engage positively in the Six Party Talks process
Mr Chairman
New Zealand recognises the right of all States party to the Treaty to peaceful uses of nuclear technology in conformity with Articles I, II and ill of the Treaty We acknowledge the many benefits that can come from the balanced and responsible use of nuclear energy, particularly in the areas of health, food security and the environment
We need to ensure that peaceful uses of nuclear technology remain accessible to all States parties, while at the same time ensuring that such technologies are managed safely and securely, and do not contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons Waste management is an essentia! consideration too
Mr Chairman,
The 2010 Review Conference is a key milestone in the life of the NPT We must make the most of this opportunity It is incumbent upon us all to ensure that the Review Conference conducts a comprehensive review of the Treaty and agrees a course of action that will serve to strengthen the NPT and to bring us one step further along the road to a world free of nuclear weapons New Zealand stands ready to work with all interested states towards a robust, forward looking process in 2010 that will reinforce the effectiveness of the Treaty and stand it in good stead for the future
Thank you Mr Chairman
