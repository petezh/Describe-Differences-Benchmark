Many survivors have said that even though they do riot want to remember their experience of the atomic bombings, they will never allow them selves to forget so that such an experience is never repeated.

â–ª Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hiroshima, I keep close to my heart the hopes of atomic bomb survivors, and I am determined to achieve progress towards a world free of nuclear 'Weapons at this Review Conference.
