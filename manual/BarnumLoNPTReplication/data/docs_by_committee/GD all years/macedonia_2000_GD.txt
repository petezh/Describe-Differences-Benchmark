Let me first express my Delegation's great satisfaction to see you, the Representative of Algeria, presiding with this important Conference.
In your endeavor to bring it to a successful end, you will have our full support. I would also like to congratulate the members of your Bureau on their election to the high posts of the Conference.
In our view, the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is well prepared for a serious and positive review of the Treaty. The contribution of the Secretariat in that respect is very important. I would like to note with satisfaction that fact and the leadership of the Secretary-General and of his Under-Secretary General, Mr. Dhanapala in that effort. The positive contribution of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the preparatory process for this Conference is also highly appreciated.
The views of my Delegation coincide with those expressed by the Representative of Portugal, speaking on behalf of the European Union. 
Mr. President,
The Republic of Macedonia in 1995 was among the majority States Parties to the Treaty on NPT in favor of its indefinite extension. The Decision No.3 of that Conference was of crucial importance for the strengthening of the NPT regime, a positive impetus on the nuclear disarmament process and to the efforts for the peaceful use of the nuclear energy. In general, it was also an important contribution to the improvement of the international cooperation. At present, the prevailing view is that after 1995 progress was recorded, but not as much as expected. Some negative developments that have threatened the international security situation could have been prevented. It should be noted that in this period, after 1995, the maintenance of international peace and security, in many regions, was threatened much more by other negative developments and destructive forces rather than by non observance of the NPT regime.
The task of the present Review Conference of the NPT is to examine both the implementation and non implementation of the Treaty and to convince states that are not parties to the Treaty to accede to it, as soon as possible. Also, the aim is to further strengthen the role and the authority of the International Atomic Energy Agency. These important undertakings by this Conference can be successful if the Conference could have the whole picture of the international security situation and, in particular, if it could fully adhere to the position that the international security situation has completely changed since 1990 and that it is still rapidly changing. We have left behind us the periods of confrontation and coexistence, we are galloping fast into the period of cooperation and integration, into the period of globalization. The forces of globalization will dominate with the international security situation in the years to come. These forces do not favor weapons. They favor strict compliance with the NPT regime, arms control, they are against the nuclear weapons and against all other weapons of mass destruction. Those that will not grasp this reality of the present, simply speaking, will be marginalized. So, the observance of the NPT regime in our view should be seen as an important contribution to the overall strengthening of the international relations, to the increase of the international cooperation, and of course, to the strengthening of the multilateralism, the United Nations, in particular.
Mr. President,
At present, the main priority of the Republic of Macedonia is its integration into the Euro-Atlantic structures, membership into the European Union and NATO. Our country can develop better and faster if it becomes a member of the European Union, and the security situation of our country and that of our Region will be much more sound if we are fully integrated into the NATO. We are doing our best in this direction and we are optimistic. The observance of the NPT Treaty by us and by other states of our Region, the South-Eastern Europe, is essential in this respect. Simultaneously with this, it is essential that the General Assembly resolutions initiated by the Republic of Macedonia, 50/80 B. 51/55, 54/48, 53/7 and 54/62 are fully observed and implemented. Resolution 54/62 has affirmed the urgency of the consolidation of South-Eastern Europe as a region of peace, security, stability, democracy, cooperation, economic development, observance of human rights and good-neighborliness. The GA has also emphasized the importance of regional efforts in South-Eastern Europe on arms control, disarmament and confidence-building measures. One of the most important vehicles to achieve all this is the implementation of the Pact of Stability for South-Eastern Europe, which is important focus of many activities in the Region and in Europe.
Mr. President,
The danger of the use of the nuclear weapons is diminishing, but the threat to use it is not, it is out there and the international community will be faced with it for some time in the future. And this is, of course, not a happy situation. On the other hand, the interest for the peaceful use of the nuclear energy will increase which is a positive development that should be supported. This, together with the strengthening of the technological capability in the field of nuclear technology will result in an increase of the number of countries capable of producing nuclear weapons. The NPT regime must address this danger and Parties to the NPT should endeavor to prevent such an occurrence. This should be done in accordance with the provisions of the NPT and also in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the international law. So, for non nuclear states like the Republic of Macedonia, the main interest is to achieve further strengthening of the NPT regime together with undertakings and other measures that will positively affect the security situation and the economic and social development. It is important to stress the beneficial influence of nuclear disarmament on the mobilization of resources for development in this regard.
Mr. President,

In other forums we have already emphasized the importance of the accession to the NPT of Andorra, Angola, Brazil, Chile, Comoros, Djibouti, Oman, United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu since the 1995 Review and Extension Conference. We are close to the aim to achieve universal membership to this Treaty. The Conference should address the necessity that four other states accede to the Treaty. The Conference should not miss this opportunity. With all these countries, the Republic of Macedonia maintains excellent relations. Traditionally, they have been in favor of full observance of the Charter of the United Nations, a main base for the NPT Treaty.
The major event in the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament after 1995 was the completion of the negotiations on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty which was open for signature on 24 September 1996. I have the honor to inform you that the Republic of Macedonia has ratified the CTBT in March this year. It is encouraging that so many states, both nuclear and non nuclear have signed it and have ratified it. This was a result of a vigorous effort of the international community. The adoption of the Final Declaration in Vienna by the ratifying and signatory states in October 1999 helped this process. The ratification by the Russian Federation some days ago represents an important encouragement for other states to follow, including of course, by the United States of America whose leadership in the adoption of this instrument is widely known and has been highly praised.
After the 1995 Conference, practically all forums on nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, including the 54th session of the General Assembly, have been stressing the urgency that the Conference on Disarmament should start to negotiate a non-discriminating and universally applicable Convention, banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices. The negotiations, regrettably, have not started, which is a negative development. One of the reasons for this is the outdated arrangement of the work of the CD, which continues to work in the same way as during the cold war. We hope, however that the present difficulties will be overcome.
The Conference will review the reduction of the nuclear weapons, in accordance with the conclusion of the 1995 NPT Conference. At the 1995 Conference the nuclear weapon states reaffirmed their commitment to pursue in good faith negotiations on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament, to pursue systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons. The Secretary-General's Report prepared for this Conference points out the fact that the developments from 1995 up to now could have been better. The long awaited ratification by the Russian Federation of START II is a welcomed development which hopefully could lead to the commencement of START III negotiations and on other issues such as, strategic doctrines, the prevention of arms race in the outer space, ballistic missile defenses and etc. Among these complex issues is the current state of relations among nuclear states and non-nuclear states on nuclear disarmament, particularly in the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. So far, the nuclear weapon states have rejected to negotiate with the non-nuclear weapon states and it is not realistic to expect that the nuclear weapon states will change their position. However, that does not mean that the non-nuclear weapon states should abandon the goal of eliminating the nuclear weapons. They should pursue positions which will make the realization of this goal, shared also by the nuclear weapons states, better sooner than later.
The reaffirmation of the conviction by the 1995 NPT Conference that the establishment of internationally recognized nuclear-weapon free zones, on the basis of arrangement freely arrived at among the States of the Region concerned, enhances global and regional peace and security and proved to be an important undertaking by the 1995 Conference. This Conference should do the same. New zones were established: The Bangkok Treaty of 1997, Pelindaba Treaty of 1996, the agreement to establish a nuclear-weapon free zone in Central Asia, the international recognition of Mongolia as nuclear weapon free status. Regretfully, there was no progress on the establishment of nuclear-weapon free zones in the Middle East in accordance with the resolution on the Middle East adopted by the 1995 NPT Conference.
The Conference will pay particular attention on the safeguards and on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, an area of utmost importance to the majority Member-States of the NPT. The Conference will review the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency and I am sure that it will take note of the work well done with appreciation and that it will encourage the Agency to go on with its dedicated activities, which are very important for the realization of the goals of the NPT. The Conference should insist on a full scope of safeguards, on greater transparency in nuclear related export controls and should encourage all parties of the NPT to develop, research, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The efforts for new and renewable energies should not be an obstacle for this necessity. However, the dangers of the old nuclear plants should be addressed and the international cooperation in this respect. Another Chernobyl should not occur.
Mr. President,
The 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons is seen as the most important international political event before the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in September this year. The expectations of the Conference are enormous but at the same time a feeling of pessimism among delegations is present. The Republic of Macedonia is part of the huge majority of Member-States of the NPT Treaty that wish a successful outcome of the Conference and its Delegation is ready to work towards that end. 
Thank you.
