Mr. Chairman,
Allow me to congratulate you and other members of the bureau on your well-deserved election. We are convinced that your experienced leadership and able stewardship will provide a renewed impetus towards a fruitful conclusion of this Meeting. We also thank the Secretary General for his optimistic words delivered yesterday in the morning session.
My delegation associates itself with the statement delivered by Cuba on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). However, I would like to touch upon the following points in my national capacity.
Mr. Chairman,
We are meeting here in an opportune time. In recent days, the long neglected issues of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation have received renewed momentum after a long stalemate. Key states have expressed their willingness to work towards nuclear disarmament. We welcome their positive indications. These indications, when translated into practical actions, will add further impetus towards attaining our goals of a nuclear weapons free world. In our view, multilateralism remains the only way that can effectively work towards universalization of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation instruments. I hope, the deliberations of the present session will also have practical impact for achieving the goals of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. In our part, Bangladesh delegation is fully committed to provide its full support and cooperation to the work of this conference.
Mr. Chairman,
The NPT remains the most important instrument for attaining the objectives of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. To attain these goals, CTBT is an important step forward. Therefore, we reaffirm the need for universality of the NPT, the CTBT and all major international disarmament instruments without any exception. Regrettably yet, the lack of political will of some Member States has been impeding progress towards these goals. We also maintain that statements of nuclear weapons states and efforts of international community must be matched by concrete action in this regard.
We stress that the non-nuclear state parties to the NPT have a legitimate right of unconditioned security assurances from Nuclear Weapons States. Therefore?, we call for an early negotiation of a universal, unconditional, and legally binding instrument on security assurances to non nuclear weapon states against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. These legally binding security assurances remain essential for non-nuclear weapon states, pending realization of a world free of nuclear weapons.
Mr. Chairman,
Bangladesh has played its due role towards achieving the goals of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. It has unconditionally opted to remain non-nuclear and has become party to almost iill disarmament related treaties including NPT and CTBT. We were also the first country in South Asia to sign the CTBT. Bangladesh remains under the s;ifeguard measures of the IAEA including additional protocols. These are the tangible testimonies to our unwavering commitment towards the goal of disarmament in general and nuclear disarmament, in particular.
We are also supportive of regional approaches to nuclear disarmament. We have appreciated the creation of Nuclear Weapons Free Zones in several regions. We are particularly encouraged by the recent entry into force of the Central Asian Nuclear Weapons Free Zones (CANWFZ) Treaty. We recognize that the formation of nuclear-weapons-free-zones (NnVFZ) marks important process towards the way of establishing nuclear-weapons-free-world (NWFW). We support the establishment of such zones in South Asia, Middle East and other parts of the world. We believe, this will contribute to regional confidence building measures and reduce threat to the security of non-nuclear weapon states.
Mr. Chairman,
The NPT guarantees the inalienable rights of all States to develop, research, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Cooperation from developed countries in this regard has also been assured for non-nuclear State
Parties to the NPT in developing areas of the world. Resources, therefore, must be mobilized for technical and financial assistance to the compliant Member States that are in dire need of nuclear energy for peaceful use.
Unfortunately, we have noted that the world's expenditure on armament in 2007 was around US$ 1.4 trillion. It reflects a real-term increase of 6 percent over 2006, and of 45 percent since 1998. This amount corresponds to US$ 202 for each person in the world. Clearly, some states are spending excessive financial, technological and human resources on armament. Whereas about one billion of the world population are living below poverty line without having access to bare necessity of life. The ongoing financial crisis has affected them disproportionately to further marginalization, making MDGs extremely difficult to attain. We therefore, stress that such mindless expenditures must be reversed to free resources from armaments to address the pressing development challenges.
Mr. Chairman,
We are heading towards the 2010 NPT Review Conference. It is the high time that we take stock of progress we made on our previous commitments. We urge upon all state parties to remain fully committed to their obligations! and commitments under the NPT as well as the aj^reements reached among them at the Review and Extension Conferences of 1995 and Review Conference of 2000. We call upon all member states to incorporate practical measures for implementation of our nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation goals. The outcome documents of the current session should therefore be so drafted that it contains elements of disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses, comprehensively, and has specific mechanism for their effective implementation and follow up.
Mr. Chairman,
Lack of consensus among Member States impeded the adoption of consensus document in 2005 NPT Review Conference. While this has been both frustrating and disappointing after consensual conclusion of 2000 Review Conference, we take solace in the fact the there seems to be some positive minds of change in recent days. We must seize this momentum. I hope, the Member States will show maximum flexibility and understanding to adopt consensus for the 2010 NPT Review Conference which will ultimately j^uide us towards establishing a nuclear weapons free world.
I thank you Mr. Chairman.
