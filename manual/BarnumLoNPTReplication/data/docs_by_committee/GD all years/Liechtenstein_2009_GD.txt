At the outset let me join others in assuring you our support in your efforts to lead this last Preparatory Committee of the upcoming Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2010 to a successful outcome. The last Review Conference in 2005 was a significant setback in our common efforts on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Almost 40 years after its entry into force the NPT - a cornerstone of a global security architecture - suffers from a worrisome trend that we must reverse. The concerns of member states causing the slow progress made by the last two sessions of the Preparatory Committee in 2007 and 2008 are closely linked to the three pillars of NPT regime: non-proliferation, disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The 2010 Review Conference must therefore restore the balance between all three mutually reinforcing pillars. Progress both in disarmament and non-proliferation is particularly essential and neither should be made conditional on progress in the other. Despite the setbacks we have witnessed in the last years, we are encouraged by positive developments including the commitment of the parties to START to a new binding treaty before it expires by the end of 2009. The ultimate goal must be to bring all remaining states into the NPT regime as non-nuclear weapon states and to ensure the universality of the treaty and its provisions.
Mr. Chairman,
With regard to non-proliferation we must improve and strengthen the IAEA verification mechanism by making the IAEA additional protocol the verification standard. Liechtenstein therefore signed the Additional Protocol to its IAEA Safeguard Agreement in 2006 and we call on all States that have not yet done so, to also conclude an Additional Protocol. The misuse of civilian nuclear programs for military ends must be prevented, in particular with a view to the risk posed by the nuclear fuel cycle. We support the proposal of a fuel bank to be placed under IAEA auspices that would guarantee the supply of nuclear fuel thereby minimizing the risk of nuclear proliferation. To combat the proliferation of WMD to nonstate actors it is imperative that states implement the mechanisms established by Resolution
1540 and further develop their legitimacy and effectiveness. For the future, we must develop a clear understanding on the withdrawal from the treaty. From an international law perspective, it is clear that States found in violation of their treaty obligations remain responsible for this conduct even after having effectively withdrawn from the treaty.
Mr. Chairman,
We welcome the announcement by the new US Administration to immediately pursue ratification to the CTBT. Liechtenstein ratified the CTBT in 2004, firmly believing that an end to nuclear testing provides a great step towards ensuring security and stability. We must overcome the deadlock in the Conference on Disarmament on the negotiations of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices (FMCT) as an important element of strengthening non-proliferation and disarmament regime. It is our strong believe that pursuing these long overdue negotiations would have an advantage for nuclear as well as for non-nuclear weapon states. Pending the entry into force of an FMCT, we join others in calling on States concerned to declare and uphold a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices.
Mr. Chairman,
In next tow decades we will see a tremendous increase in energy demands,, in particular in the developing world. Proliferation concerns must not undermine the right of States parties to the NPT to develop, research, produce and use of nuclear energy in conformity with Articles lr II and III of the treaty. At the same time;, we must ensure, however, that the technology is used in a responsible manner without contributing to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Liechtenstein reaffirms in this regard its full support for the work of the IAEA in the field of technical cooperation and assistance.
I thank you.
