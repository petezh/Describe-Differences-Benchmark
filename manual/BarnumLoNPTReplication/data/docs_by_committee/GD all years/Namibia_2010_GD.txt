Mr. President,
We have come here to reaffirm our commitment to a world without nuclear weapons and our faith in multilateralism and the NPT as an important instrument for disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy,
Mr. President,
I wish to congratulate you and other members of the bureau for assuming the Presidency of this Review Conference. I would like to assure you of Namibia's support and cooperation to bring this conference to a successful conclusion. My delegation associates itself with the statement delivered by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia on behalf of the Non-Align Movement.
Mr. President, the
The 8 Review Conference is taking place against the backdrop of important global developments which we have to take advantage of in order to sustain the momentum toward implementation of the 13 steps adopted at the 2000 Review Conference.
Mr. President,
The events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated that nuclear weapons are the most inhumane weapons because of their indiscriminate nature. It is deplorable that more states have continued to acquire these weapons after 1958. Equally disappointing is the fact that our collective efforts to annihilate nuclear weapons have fallen short.
Namibia welcomes the signing of the START Agreement between the Russian Federation and the United States of America in April 2010. We believe that the current level of nuclear arsenal is unacceptable with consequences of use too ghastly to contemplate. We must move away from the notion of reduction versus modernization of nuclear war heads. We must abandon the illogical assertion that nuclear weapons are good for some to possess and bad for others. For this undermines the very purpose of our collective efforts towards disarmament and non-proliferation.
We cannot rely on the good will of any nation not to use nuclear weapons. We can only instill confidence through universal legally binding measures not to use these dreaded weapons. Those who possess nuclear weapons must destroy them, lest they tempt others to do likewise.
We have invested substantively in raising awareness on the production and use of nuclear weapons. Now we must take advantage of the momentum toward nuclear disarmament by increasing disarmament and non-proliferation education.
Mr. President,
As we seek to curb the production and test of nuclear weapons, we must strengthen international peace and security so as to avoid temptation of their use. No nuclear weapons state can design or develop new types of nuclear weapons without testing them. Nothing can effectively boost nuclear non-proliferation than the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
Namibia believes that the entry into force of the CTBT is the first step to effective nuclear disarmament and would greatly enhance the international regime for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. In this connection, we urge those who have not yet ratified the CTBT especially the Annex 2 states to do so.
Disarmament cannot be a generous gesture of one nation to another. Nuclear disarmament is in the interest of all our nations. In nuclear disarmament there are no winners and losers, only winners. In a nuclear war however there are only losers.
Mr. President,
Namibia is committed to achieving a world free of nuclear weapons where nations and peoples can live in peace and harmony. In this regard Namibia welcomes the entry into force of the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty, the Pelindaba Treaty. We regard this milestone as an important step for regional peace and security. Namibia is in the process of ratifying this important instrument.
Namibia believes that the establishment of nuclear weapon free zones in all the regions of the world is an important step towards complete nuclear disarmament. The 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference adopted a resolution on the Middle East calling for the establishment of a nuclear weapons free zone in that region. This Review Conference should embody a commitment by all parties to implement the 1995 Resolution. The objective of the NPT cannot be realized by implementing its provisions selectively, neither can the universality of the NPT be realized amidst regionalized proliferation.
Mr. President,
The NPT pillars are interdependent and the balance among them should be upheld at all times. Non-Proliferation can only be ensured when we apply the same standards to one and ail. Therefore, we call upon all NPT signatory states without comprehensive safeguards agreements to conclude them without further delay. In Namibia's view effective safeguard system would be enhanced when those possessing the technology ensure that their cooperation on nuclear technology is guided by the norms of the NPT and the IAEA Statute. The placement of all nuclear weapons states facilities under the IAEA safeguards should be an obligation for all nuclear weapon states and not an option for some.
Mr. President,
The slogan Atoms for Peace is not an empty call. It is a call to apply nuclear technology to create a world of prosperity and free from want. No country should be denied its inalienable right to develop its nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
In this regard the implementation of article IV of the NPT without discrimination is paramount. We commend the IAEA for assisting developing countries, to access technology for nuclear energy. Namibia is well endowed with the source material for nuclear energy. Yet, most of our people live without adequate electricity supply. Many of them have no access to nuclear medicine, despite the growing advances of nuclear application in health.
We appreciate the assistance of the IAEA to developing countries to build their capacity for cancer management and applaud the Director-General of the IAEA for making cancer his focus for the year 2010. We welcome the IAEA's concerted efforts to make a meaningful contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria. Along with cancer these are some of the major diseases that most of the developing countries are grappling with and my own country is no exception. We must therefore strengthen the technical cooperation of the IAEA.
As the benefit of nuclear energy continues to increase, they need to be expanded in scope to touch the lives of many. Consequently, interests in nuclear energy have continued to grow and many developing countries including Namibia have declared their interest to launch nuclear power programmes.
In this regard the efforts of the Agency in assisting Member States to develop their national nuclear power programmes are highly commendable. We shall continue to engage the IAEA to initiate a nuclear power programme for electricity generation in Namibia in order to derive maximum benefits from our uranium.
Namibia supports the multilaterialisation of the nuclear fuel cycle. However, this should not lead to attempts to concentrate nuclear technology in the hands of a few, thus creating nuclear fuel dependence. In this regard consultations among members of the IAEA should continue in order to ensure consensus. As a major producer of the source material, Namibia will play its role.
Mr. President,
Nuclear security affects all states. Nuclear security challenges have added responsibility to the IAEA which in turn call for the strengthening of the Agency to meet the increasing demands of member states. The agency is already engaged in this field and with increased support from member states it can certainly do more.
Mr. President,
For decades the international community has pursued nuclear disarmament without much success. This is not a legacy that we should pass on to the next generation. We have to deliver on our commitments.
In the quest for a nuclear weapon free world, no state party is too big to do it alone, and none is too small not to make a contribution. Multilateralism is critical to attaining disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy.
I thank you.
