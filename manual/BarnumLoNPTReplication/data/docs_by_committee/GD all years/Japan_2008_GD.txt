Mr. Chairman, Distinguished delegates,
At the outset, on behalf of my delegation, please allow me to congratulate you, Ambassador Volodymyr Yel'chenko of Ukraine, on your assumption of the chair of the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) Review Conference. We assure you of our utmost support in your endeavors. It was satisfying for Japan that last year the 2010 review process got off to a successful start under the guidance of Chairman Amano. Based on the outcomes of last year's first session, we are positive that meaningful and substantial discussions will also take place under your able leadership, Ambassador Yel'chenko, within the current Preparatory Committee.
Mr. Chairman,
From the viewpoint of the only country to experience the devastation of nuclear bombings, Japan strongly hopes for achievement of a safe world free of nuclear weapons on the earliest possible date. Japan, for improving the security environment, places immense importance on maintaining and strengthening the NPT, which is the cornerstone of the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime. Nevertheless, the NPT regime now faces a variety of serious challenges. Firstly, in relation to nuclear disarmament, nuclear weapon States have made announcements and presented initiatives for new disarmament measures. As this trend is welcomed as having a positive impact on the current NPT review process, greater progress on nuclear disarmament including above mentioned measures by nuclear-weapons states is imperative for maintaining and strengthening the NPT regime. Secondly, the nuclear issues of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Iran, which are of a very grave nature, require the continued efforts of the States Parties as a high priority. Thirdly, as the anticipated demand for energy grows, the question of how to balance the needs of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and nuclear non-proliferation is an important issue that the whole international community should also tackle. Lastly, dedicated efforts must continue in order to improve the universalization of the NPT. These are extremely grave challenges, but Japan is convinced that the NPT regime can be strengthened further by overcoming them.
With this understanding in mind, Japan hopes that the mutual understanding of the significance and role of the NPT regime will be promoted among the States Parties, and that substantial deliberations are conducted within the current PrepCom on all the issues just pointed out, based on last year's agenda. Consequently, we anticipate that it will be demonstrated to the international community that the NPT
fulfils an exceptionally vital and effective role for international peace and security, and confidence in the NPT is maintained and improved.
Mr. Chairman,
It is in this spirit that Japan intends to take up the following topics within this PrepCom.
Progress in nuclear disarmament along with nuclear non-proliferation leads to the strengthening of the NPT regime. The pressing issues with concrete measures are: (1) the early entry-into-force of the Comprehensive-Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and in the meanwhile a moratorium on nuclear test explosions by the relevant countries, and (2) the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty, and in the meanwhile, a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapon purposes by the relevant countries. Such legally binding multilateral measures will consolidate steps for nuclear disarmament. Furthermore, while welcoming the ongoing progress in nuclear weapons reductions, we would like to emphasize the importance of all the nuclear-weapon States reducing their arsenals with transparency. Furthermore, we believe it is important to apply the principles of irreversibility and veriflability to these nuclear disarmament measures. I will talk about these issues in detail during Cluster 1, but I would like to draw the attention of the States Parties to the working paper on nuclear disarmament which Japan has submitted to the present session.
Mr. Chairman,
The nuclear issues of the DPRK and Iran present a serious challenge to the international non-proliferation regime.
As the DPRK's October 2006 announcement of a nuclear test demonstrated, the DPRK nuclear issue is a grave challenge to the NPT regime. The abandonment of all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs by the DPRK is not only essential for peace and security of Northeast Asia, but for the entire international community. Japan will continue its work to resolve peacefully and diplomatically the DPRK nuclear issue through the Six-Party Talks. We call on the DPRK to promptly provide a "complete and correct declaration" of all its nuclear programmes, which they promised to present by the end of last year as part of the "Second-Phase Actions". We also call on the DPRK to take steady actions towards abandoning "all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes" as agreed to in the Joint Statement of the September 2005 Six-Party Talks. Furthermore, we urge the DPRK to abide promptly by the obligations stipulated in UN Security Council Resolution 1718. Recently, the US Government issued a statement on a matter of proliferation concern regarding DPRK's assistance to
Syria's covert nuclear activities. The international community must remain vigilant to the challenges we face.
Japan regrets that, despite the repeated calls of the international community, Iran has not complied with the requirements of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, which include the suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, as well as a heavy water-related program. Although there has been a certain amount of progress in the implementation of the programme of work for resolving the "outstanding issues" agreed to between Iran and the IAEA Secretariat last August, Iran has further continued and expanded its enrichment-related activities without re-establishing the confidence that Iran's nuclear programs are exclusively peaceful in their nature. This further aggravates the situation. For resolving this issue peacefully and diplomatically, Japan will tenaciously urge Iran to comply with the requirements of the relevant UN resolutions, including UN Security Council Resolution 1803, which was adopted last month. Moreover, it is important that each country steadily implements the measures required in these resolutions.
Mr. Chairman,
Japan believes that universalizing the IAEA Additional Protocol is the most realistic and effective way to strengthen the international non-proliferation regime. We exhort all the States Parties that have yet to conclude an Additional Protocol to do so expeditiously. Japan believes it imperative that the peaceful uses of nuclear energy be prompted in a manner consistent with the highest level of safeguards standards including the IAEA Additional Protocol. To this end, we intend to further intensify out-reach activities through cooperation with the IAEA and other like-minded countries.
Mr. Chairman,
In recent years, expanding global energy demand and efforts to prevent global warming have brought about a reexamination of the role of nuclear energy, and internationally the promotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy is gaining momentum.
The use of nuclear power must be accompanied by commitments to effective implementation of nuclear non-proliferation/Safeguards, Safety and Security (3Ss). It is even more important for the international community to reconfirm common understanding that ensuring 3Ss constitutes an indispensable part of the necessary infrastructure for the introduction of nuclear power generation. While ensuring 3Ss is primarily the responsibility of the countries interested in nuclear power programs, international cooperation in this field is beneficial to support the countries concerned. The IAEA has undertaken various important activities for
ensuring 3S and Japan intends to continue its support for the IAEA. In particular, the international community must tackle the new issue of strengthening nuclear security to ensure the prevention of the proliferation of fissile material to non-state-actors such as terrorists. In this regard, Japan is making efforts to enhance nuclear security through such measures as its contributions to the IAEA Nuclear Security Fund, It is Japan's intention to carry on such support.
Mr. Chairman,
The NPT recognizes the right of a State Party to withdraw in the situation that "extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of this Treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country". This, however, should not occur from the perspective of international peace and security. Since there are a range of different arguments, I will not speak on this subject in detail, but I would like to note that there is already a stockpile of useful discussions on this topic. Japan has submitted a working paper on withdrawal, and we hope that further constructive discussions take place at this Preparatory Committee.
Mr. Chairman,
Japan believes that gaining a broader recognition of disarmament and non-proliferation in civil society, including among young people, is indispensable for progress in this field, and, thus, attaches importance to disarmament and non-proliferation education. Japan would like to point out the importance of deepening and spreading recognition of the NPT's role, as well as promulgating knowledge and experience on the immense destructive power of nuclear weapons and their effects on humans and the environment. In this regard, Japan has submitted a working paper on this subject and will be holding in collaboration with UNIDIR, a side-event on disarmament and non-proliferation education, with the cooperation of civil society during this PrepCom.
Mr. Chairman,
Lastly, allow me to conclude by saying that the Government of Japan has submitted to this PrepCom three working papers on the three pillars, a working paper on withdrawal, and a working paper on disarmament and non-proliferation education. In addition to these efforts, we intend to participate proactively in the upcoming Cluster debates. It is our strong desire that a solid foundation is established for the 2010 NPT Review Conference through frank discussions among the NPT States Parties in the current Preparatory Committee.
I thank you for your attention.
