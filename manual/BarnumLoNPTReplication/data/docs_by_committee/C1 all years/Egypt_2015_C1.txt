The Permanent Mission of Egypt
to the United Nations
New York

Mr. Chair,
Allow me, at the outset, to congratulate you on assuming the chairmanship of Main Committee 1.
You are undertaking this responsibility at a time and in a context which is both delicate and
difficult for the NPT. This calls for all of us to extend to you the support and assistance that you
require in order to enable this Committee to carry out the mission devolved on it.
Mr. Chair,
Egypt attaches the highest priority to global, non-discriminatory, verifiable nuclear disarmament
and the complete elimination of nuclear weapons in a time bound manner. In this context, we
would like to express our deep concern at the continuous threat posed to humanity by the existence
of nuclear weapons, and reaffirm that the total elimination of nuclear weapons, which represents
the primary objective of the NPT, is the only guarantee against the use or threat of use of these
weapons. This objective remains dependent upon implementation by the nuclear weapon states of
their obligations under Article VI and the achievement of universal adherence to the Treaty.
The NPT was originally created with 25 years duration, during which Nuclear-Weapon States
were expected to eliminate their nuclear arsenals and realize the objectives stipulated in Article VI.
The Nuclear-Weapon State status was thus seen under the Treaty as a transitional status. The
indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 did not mean, in any way, allowing nuclear weapon States
to continue to possess these weapons indefinitely. Any such Assumption would be contrary to the
spirit and letter of the object and purpose of the NPT.
The Middle East has and will continue to have a special status within the NPT framework and its
Review Process. The 1995 Resolution on the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle
East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and 1995 Decision on
Principles and Objectives of Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, adopted as essential part
of the indefinite extension package highlighted the essential foundation that the goals of
universality and nuclear disarmament represent for the indefinitely extended Treaty, its
effectiveness and credibility.

Furthermore, the 13 Practical Steps by all Nuclear-Weapon States adopted at the 2000 Review
Conference leading to nuclear disarmament remain unimplemented. The Plan of Action adopted at
the 2010 Review Conference, identified specific actions that Nuclear-Weapon States have to take
in order to promote nuclear disarmament, including Actions 5, 20Â· and 21, along with other
relevant Action Points, these also remain to be implemented.
As I said yesterday the outcome of the 2010 Action Plan turned out to be very limited. The role of
nuclear weapons in military and security doctrines of nuclear weapon States has remained largely
the same, with several States reaffirming their belief that nuclear weapons are the ultimate
guarantee of their security. The continuous efforts to pursue billions of dollars programs to
modernize stockpiles of nuclear weapons signal long term reliance on nuclear weapons. The
incessant attempts to introduce new interpretations that article VI does not quite refer to nuclear
disarmament collectively, leaving it to the discretion of some members states, cast doubts on
nuclear weapon States commitment to nuclear disarmament and put into question the credibility of
the Treaty and its utility as a tool for nuclear disarmament. Egypt expresses deep concern at the
continued lack of progress in the implementation of nuclear disarmament obligations and calls for
the full, effective and urgent implementation of the obligations under Article VI of the treaty
without any further delay.
Egypt would like to reiterate, in this context, that all the obligations under the Treaty including the
cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament represent an integral package of
commitments, the implementation of which, along with relevant decisions adopted at Review
Conferences, would collectively contribute to its effectiveness and the realization of its objectives,
while its lack of implementation would undermine the object and purpose of the NPT. Nuclear
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are mutually reinforcing elements where each of such
objectives would be of limited value if implemented without the other.

managed to bring to the attention of the international community, more than any other time, a
more thorough understanding of the sheer scale of impact of even a single detonation of a nuclear
weapon and the inability of the international community to respond adequately to the
consequences of such detonation. Egypt fully supports this process and the Austrian pledge
leading to filling the legal gap in addressing the effective measures towards the elimination of
nuclear weapons. It is our conviction that main committee- 1 should dedicate proper attention to
this issue as a central component of the march towards the de-legitimization of nuclear weapons
and their total elimination.
The Government of Egypt strongly endorses the negotiation of a Nuclear Weapons Convention
which would aim at the realization of the total and irreversible elimination of nuclear weapons
within a specified framework of time, under effective multilateral verification and control. The
2010 Plan of Action mentioned the Convention as a viable route to nuclear disarmament and the
2015 Review Conference needs to build on this. If necessary, a first step towards that objective can
be the negotiation of a Treaty banning the manufacture, possession, transfer and use or threat of
use of nuclear weapons. The New Agenda Coalition in its paper submitted to this Review
Conference. (NPT/CONF. 2015/WP. 9), introduced four options that addresses possible effective
measures to nuclear disarmament to implement article VI of the treaty, and 'with a view to
facilitating a meaningful exchange as well as decision-making on this issue at the 2015 Review
Conference.'
Egypt recalls that the 2010 Review conference reaffirmed and recognized the legitimate interest of
all non-nuclear weapon States parties to the Treaty in receiving unequivocal and legally binding
security assurances from the nuclear weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear
weapons. Receiving such assurances is a legitimate right pending the total elimination of nuclear
weapons. Egypt, therefore, reiterates that efforts to conclude a universal, unconditional and legally
binding instrument on security assurances should be pursued as a matter of priority and should be
materialized without further delay.
In this regard, the role of the Conference on Disarmament, as the sole multilateral disarmament
negotiating body within the United Nations system is to be preserved and utilized. It is of notable

importance that the Conference on Disarmament, while moving forward on a legal instrument
banning and/or seeking to totally eliminate nuclear weapons, should begin negotiations on a treaty
banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices (FMCT), in accordance with the report of the Special Coordinator of 1995 (CD/1299) and
the mandate contained therein, within an agreed, comprehensive and balanced program of work. In
order for an FMCT to contribute to nuclear disarmament, it should cover all existing fissile
material stocks and should create conditions under which Nuclear-Weapon States will not be able
to produce further nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.
Mr. Chair,
Egypt recommends that Main Committee 1 should:
- Review the implementation of obligations in the field of nuclear disarmament, under the
Treaty, taking into account relevant obligations adopted at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review
Conferences and discuss the necessary measures for the full implementation of Treaty
obligations.
- Call for the prompt and full implementation of the 2010 Action Plan on nuclear
disarmament in a time bound manner and urge the nuclear weapon States to fully comply
with their nuclear disarmament obligations under the Treaty and fully implement their
unequivocal nuclear disarmament commitments.
- Agree on measures and a timeframe for the immediate implementation of Article VI of the
NPT to commence negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of
the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament.
I would like to conclude by underscoring the need to demonstrate the political will by all parties
necessary to achieve progress on these important issues during the deliberations of Main
Committee 1.
Thank you.
