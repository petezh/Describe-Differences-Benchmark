Statement by the Delegation of Thailand
by Ms. Morakot Sriswasdi, Deputy Director-General, Department
of International Organizations, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Cluster 1: Disarmament
of the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee
for the 2020 NPT Review Conference,
23 April - 4 May 2018, Geneva

************************************************
Mr. Chair,
1. At the outset, Thailand would like to align itself with
the statement delivered by the distinguished delegate of Indonesia on
behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.
Mr. Chair,
2.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations has called for
'disarmament that saves lives.' This is not a new concept. The very first
General Assembly resolution rightly addressed the issue of nuclear
disarmament due to one simple fact: the magnitude of the humanitarian
consequences of nuclear weapons were as clear to us then as they are now.

3.
The risk of nuclear detonation, accidental or intentional, impacts
the security of us all and our shared environment.
Therefore,
the disarmament agenda must belong to the people as it impacts
humanity as a whole. In today's environment where the inte1national
security landscape is as precarious as it has ever been, it is critical that
nuclear disarmament be revitalized with the goal of maintaining
security for all, and not just a few. We need to address the issues of
nuclear deterrence and the modernization of nuclear arsenals, which
seem to ensure further insecurity and fear rather than safety and
stability, in light of their apparent inconsistency with the objectives and
purposes of the NPT.
It is our shared responsibility to do more. In this regard, Thailand
4.
calls for all States Paiiies to implement their obligations under the NPT in

full and without delay, particularly on Article VI on pursuing negotiations
in good faith on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament.
Mr. Chair,
5. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or the TPNW
is the end-station of that pursuit. But the treaty's adoption is only
the first step towards the realization of Article VI of the NPT.
To completely fill the legal gap on the prohibition of nuclear weapons
for all stakeholders, including Nuclear Weapon States and other
nuclear armed States, the disarmament agenda needs to be
reconceptualized. This agenda needs to be re-integrated into the current
global agenda. Conversations between Nuclear Wea pons States and
Non-Nuclear Weapons States must be reshaped, taking into account
the complementary and reinforcing nature of the TPNW to the NPT.

6.
The disarmament pillar of the NPT will be further implemented
when Nuclear Weapons States demonstrate stronger political will to
engage constructively in the NPT review process and take concrete
measures to eliminate their nuclear weapons to reduce the risk of
nuclear detonation, including those agreed upon and recommended at
previous Review Conferences. Furthermore, Â·commitments to
international norms on disarmament and obligations related to nuclear
weapons reduction, arms control agreements and other disarmament
agreements must be strictly observed.
7. Nuclear Weapon-Free Zones are also a mechanism to build trust
and ensure disarmament , as reflected in Article VII of the NPT.
Thailand encourages the close coordination and collaboration among
these zones in the pursuit of a nuclear weapon-free world. States
Parties of these zones should engage in dialogue with civil society
organizations on a human-centered security concept. We call on all
parties concerned to suppmi the early consultations on
the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and
other weapons of mass destruction, to further reinforce the NPT and
bring us closer to a nuclear weapon-free world.
Mr. Chair,
8. Disarmament 1nust also take into account the overarching goals
and important agendas of the international comn1unity, particularly

the Sustainable Development Goals. The mutually reinforcing nature of
disarmainent and the 2030 Agenda must be strengthened, as envisioned
by the UNSG in his remarks at the Conference of Disarmament.
We thus need inclusive and transparent consultations among
stakeholders to shape our way forward in pursuing the people's agenda.
Mr. Chair,
9. It has been nearly 50 years since we entered into the Grand
Bargain which leveraged the promise not to pursue nuclear weapons
against that of their reduction and elimination. Thailand is committed
to keeping up our end of that bargain and look forward to continuing
our work and working with all States Parties to that end. Thank you.
