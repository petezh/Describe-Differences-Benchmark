Mr. Chairman,
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime currently faces an array of serious challenges. Firstly, the past outcomes on nuclear disarmament in the NPT are not being sufficiently respected, and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) has not entered into force yet. Despite the efforts of an overwhelming number of Conference on Disarmament members, initiated by the Six Presidents, negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty (FMCT) have yet to commence. Moreover, the October 2006 nuclear test by the DPRK. in disregard of the collective demands of the international community, has sent an extreme Shockwave through the entire international community. Despite the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors' finding Iran in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement, and the repeated calls for the suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities through resolutions of the Board of Governors and the UN Security Council. Iran has continued such nuclear activities.
Japan, as the only nation to suffer the devastation of nuclear bombings, is immensely distressed by this situation and appeals to all the NPT States Parties to unite against these challenges with a real sense of urgency. To that end. it is critical for all the NPT States Parties to implement and comph with all their Treaty obligations with a renewed determination. We must return to the fundamental concept incorporated in the NPT, which is that non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament are both the indispensable wheels of a vehicle driving towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
Mr. Chairman,
The NPT, as its name will suggest, is the key legal document to the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, which aims to achieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons while ensuring nuclear non-proliferation and building confidence among states. Therefore, full implementation of the nuclear non-proliferation obligations by the non-nuclear-weapon States is extremely important as one of the pillars of the practical measures for the total elimination of nuclear weapons. As Prime Minister Abe expressed. Japan continues to maintain its Three Non-Nuclear Principles of not possessing, manufacturing, or permitting the introduction of nuclear weapons to Japanese territory, and thereby persists in its efforts to maintain international confidence, including in our own region. We would like to stress that no NPT States Party should neglect their efforts to build international confidence. The countries found as non-compliant by the IAEA Board of Governors must make the utmost efforts to return to a state of full
compliance and then to restore the confidence of the international community. This will build the confidence of regional countries and contribute to regional security. In this regard, the nuclear issues of the DPRK. which was found" non-compliant with its IAEA safeguards agreement, declared withdrawal from the NPT and went ahead with the nuclear test in disregard of international appeals, are extremely grave concerns to the security of Japan. We would like to discuss in detail nuclear non-proliferation issues in Cluster II.
(Nuclear disarmament)
Mr. Chairman,
On the other hand, while strengthening trust between States, all the nuclear-weapon States must to their utmost ability fully implement their Article VI obligations and with new determination make greater efforts towards nuclear disarmament in order for non-nuclear-weapon States to comply with their non-proliferation obligations and to achieve nuclear non-proliferation. W e will make more detailed remarks on this subject in the special time for nuclear disarmament and security assurances; nonetheless, Japan attaches great importance to the following nuclear disarmament measures.
The early entry into force of the CTBT and the immediate commencement of negotiations on an FMCT are pressing issues. The nuclear-weapon States should accelerate further nuclear disarmament measures on all types of nuclear weapons. Past outcomes, in particular the "Principles and Objectives" of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference and the Middle East Resolution, as well as the results of the 2000 Review Conference including the 13 practical steps must be respected and implemented to their fullest possible extent. Although we should lake into consideration that the security environment has changed since those day s. each country must strive to maintain their "determination to eliminate nuclear weapons".
(Assistance for De-nuclearization)
Mr. Chairman,
The G8 Global Partnership against the spread of weapons and materials oi mass destruction that remain in the Former Soviet Union is an important disarmament and non-proliferation cooperative project contributing to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Following the dismantlement of a decommissioned Victor III class nuclear submarine in December 2000, Japan decided in 2005 to dismantle five more decommissioned submarines, and work on one of them has already commenced. Furthermore, in 2006, Japan decided to cooperate in the construction of an On-shore Storage Facility for Reactor Compartment at Razboynik Bay.
(U niversalization)
Mr. Chairman,
Until all the counties join the NPT universalization will remain a top priority. In this regard, we welcome the accession of Montenegro in June last year. Japan reiterates its call for the non-NPT States Parties - India, Pakistan and Israel - to accede promptly to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States without conditions, and to bring into force the comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol. Additionally, pending their accession, we urge them to refrain from any act that would defeat the objective and purpose of the Treaty and to take practical steps in its support.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
