Thank you. Mister Chairman. Mister Chairman,
as this is the first time I take the floor in this Assembly, allow me at the outset to warmly congratulate you for your election as Chairman of this Preparatory Committee. In your endeavor, you may rely oil my delegation's unwavering support.
Mister Chairman,
as a Member State of the European Union, we fully subscribe to the statement made by the Czech Presidency. Italy wishes nonetheless to add the following brief remarks regarding FMCT, also in light of the circumstance that we were assigned the task of coordinating'the informal sessions on FMCT at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, last winter.
Italy looks forward to the early commencement of negotiations, without preconditions, on a non discriminatory, multilateral, internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.
In that regard, we noted with appreciation that no objection has been raised in principle to start negotiations of a verifiable FMCT in the Conference on Disarmament. Rather, we were heartened by the large number of positive and emphatic statements to this effect made during the general debate.
Finally, Italy welcomes the support for a verifiable FMCT expressed in the recent Joint Statement by the Presidents of the Russian Federation and of the United States of America.
Thank you, Mister Chairman.
