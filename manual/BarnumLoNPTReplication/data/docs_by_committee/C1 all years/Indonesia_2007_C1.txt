Mr. Chairman
My delegation would like to associate itself with the statement made by Ambassador of Indonesia, on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.
Mr. Chairman,
The NPT review process is about reinforcing the norms and principles expressed in the Treaty. As enshrined in Decision 1 of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, States parties agree to strengthen the review process for the operation of the Treaty with a view to assuring that the purposes of the Preamble and the provisions of the Treaty are being realized.
As part of the NPT review process, the purpose of the Prepcom is to consider principles, objectives and ways in order to promote the full implementation and the universality as well as to make preparation thereon to the Revcon.
The process of Revcon should look forward as well as backward. They should evaluate the results of the period they are reviewing, including the implementation of undertakings of States parties under the Treaty, and identify areas and the means through which further progress should be sought in the future.
It is important to look back on the evolution of the review process over the life of the Treaty. Such a retrospective view can provide an understanding of the evolution of the Treaty and shed light on its future development. With the failure of the 2005 Revcon to agree on a final document, the outcomes of the 1995 and 2000 will remain as a 'benchmark' for evaluating the operation of the Treat/ towards the 2010 Revcon.
Although the world has changed overtime, we should not pick and choose issues which will remain of enduring importance and which may be overtaken by events or become less important. It is therefore important for all of us to address all provisions of the Treaty in a non-discriminatory and balanced manner.
