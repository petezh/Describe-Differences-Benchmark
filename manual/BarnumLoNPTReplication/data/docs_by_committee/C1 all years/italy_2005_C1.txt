Mr. Chairman,
The Delegation of Luxembourg made, on behalf of the EU, an opening statement to this Conference underling the EU's continued strong support for nuclear disarmament. Such a commitment is also clearly expressed in the common position relating to this Conference adopted by the Council of the European Union on April 25 of this year. The Head of the Italian Delegation has reiterated these concepts in his opening statement to this Conference. Let me also subscribe fully to the statement made by the Presidency of the EU in this specific Main Committee.
As many other countries, Italy shares the objectives enshrined in art. VI of the NPT and encourages negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. Disarmament is indeed one of the pillars of the NPT. We understand the aspiration of those who advocate more efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons and will continue, together with our EU partners, to look forward to further systematic and progressive efforts towards nuclear disarmament.
Mr. Chairman,
I take this opportunity to inform that Italy- has finalized its Report on the Implementation of Article VI and Paragraph 4 (c) of the 1995 Decision on "Principles and Objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament."
Much still has to be done to reach the objective of nuclear disarmament, but it would not be appropriate to minimize or dismiss what has been done until now.
Mr. Chairman,
On May 18 the Delegation of Luxembourg presented, on behalf of the European Union, to the Plenary of this Conference the working paper NPT/CONF.2005/WP.37 entitled "European Union common approach, Co-operative Threat Reduction-Global Partnership initiative". Italy fully supports this document.
My country has already drawn the attention of the main international fora on disarmament, including the Preparatory Committee of this Conference (working paper NPT/CONF.2005/PC.III/WP.23), on this initiative. Several delegations have made reference to this issue during this Conferernce. I would like to be more specific and concentrate your attention on the nuclear implications of this initiative. The significant reductions of nuclear weapons through plurilateral, bilateral and unilateral nuclear disarmament and arms limitation treaties and processes in the past decades have brought to the attention of the international community that disarmament
engagements are meaningless unless the weapons involved are either physically destroyed or appropriately disposed of.
In the past decade, many countries have worked together - under the CTR initiative - to secure and dismantle nuclear, biological and chemical weapons materials, carriers and infrastructure. The culminating moment of those initiatives took place in Kananaskis, Canada, in June 2002, when the leaders of the Group of Eight (G-8) countries announced a "Global Partnership" against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction.
Mr. Chairman,
At a time in which nuclear proliferation is a growing threat to international peace and security and the risk that terrorists may seek to possess either fissile material or even nuclear weapons, the Co-operative Threat Reduction should be considered as a new, additional way to address the problem of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non- proliferation.
The CTR deals with highly sensitive materials and equipments; most of them have traditionally been held secret by countries which had, in the past, confronted each other. The fact that they have now become the object of international co-operation enhances transparency and confidence. It thus strengthens trust between states and facilitates the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons as foreseen in the preambular part of the Treaty. The CTR also accelerates the nuclear arms reduction process, facilitates the accession to the NPT, thus strengthening the nuclear non- proliferation regime.
Mr. Chairman,
On the basis of the above remarks, Italy fully supports the invitation made by the EU Presidency to "recognize the importance, from the point of view of nuclear disarmament, of the programs for the destruction and the elimination of nuclear weapons and the elimination of fissile material as defined under the G-8 Global Partnership", and wishes that this language be included in the final documents of this Conference.
