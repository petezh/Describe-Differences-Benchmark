Mr. Chairman,
My delegation associates itself with the statements delivered by Egypt on behalf of the NAM States Parties to the NPT, and by New Zealand on behalf of the De-Alerting Group. In addition, my delegation wishes to make the following points.
Mr. Chairman,
Five years have passed since the last Review Conference. Despite the positive developments that we have seen in the past few months, we must sadly admit, we are far behind from where we wanted to be 40 years ago. We must acknowledge that it has been our collective failure to advance the nuclear disarmament agenda as envisaged by the architects of the NPT. We have not fulfilled the commitments that we made in 1995 when we extended this Treaty indefinitely. Furthermore, we have not seen any fruitful outcomes from the 13 Practical Steps that we endorsed in 2000.
Mr Chairman,
The success of this Review Conference lies in the raison d'etre of the Treaty itself - making success of its goals of disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. At this Conference we must revitalise the NPT through the reaffirmation and implementation of past commitments, particularly those made in 1995 and 2000. We must be steadfast in pursuing our goals and ensure that this Review Conference ends in success.
Mr. Chairman,
Malaysia continues to place nuclear disarmament as its highest priority. We remain convinced that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only solution against their possible use or threat of use. The Fifth Review Conference of the Non- Proliferation Treaty in 1995 agreed that the indefinite extension of the Treaty does not accord the Nuclear Weapons States the privilege to possess nuclear weapons in perpetuity. In 2000, benchmarks towards nuclear disarmament in the name of the 13 Practical Steps were established. These benchmarks have yet to be fulfilled. Nuclear Weapon States have a positive role to play in this regard and should demonstrateleadership by committing themselves to nuclear disarmament via implementation of commitments and undertaking agreed in 1995 and 2000, in a specified period of time culminating in the total elimination of their nuclear weapons, through the conclusion of a Nuclear Weapons Convention.
5. We welcome the recently signed new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, in Prague by U.S. President Obama and Russian President Medvedev. However we view the new START as part of disarmament obligations which are long overdue by Nuclear Weapon States in line with their NPT commitments. Malaysia remains convinced that the reductions in deployments cannot substitute irreversible cuts aimed at the total elimination of nuclear weapons.
Mr Chairman,
There have been tendencies of placing non-proliferation compliance before disarmament compliance. Tangible progress within this Committee will only be possible if equal emphasis is placed on both disarmament and non-proliferation as both issues are inter-related and mutually reinforcing.
The selectivity and double standards manifested in addressing the two pillars have only sewed to weaken the NPT. The NPT, which should have curtailed the number of Nuclear Weapons States at 5, has failed as other countries outside the Treaty have developed such weapons. Both the issues of disarmament and non-proliferation must be genuinely addressed together. The balance between the two is a critical component of the NPT. The NPT can no longer be implemented in a segmented or selective manner. We must move away from such tendencies and inclinations. The NPT must be implemented true to its spirit and letter.
Mr Chairman,
While we welcome the commitment by some Nuclear Weapon States on the reduction of deployed nuclear weapons, we remain concerned and disturbed over reports that nuclear weapons continue to be deployed at high levels of readiness. Malaysia strongly believes that taking nuclear weapons off alert is a practical qualitative step that complements the quantitative step of reduction. In this regard, I wish to highlight the working paper submitted by New Zealand on behalf of the De-Alerting Group, which Malaysia is part of. We hope the elements which we have proposed in the working paper will draw broad support among delegations at this Conference.
On another issue, Malaysia remains convinced that pending the total elimination of nuclear weapons, efforts for the conclusion of a universal, unconditional and legally binding instrument on security assurances to Non-Nuclear Weapon States parties to the Treaty should be undertaken as a matter of priority. In this regard, we note that the US Nuclear Posture Review states that the United States "wall not use or threaten to use" its nuclear arsenal against States that do not have nuclear weapons of their own, and are "in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations".
This we see as a positive indication of the continuous efforts in addressing one of the core issues within the NPT. We hope that this can be taken as a positive signal for this Review Conference to reinvigorate discussions pertaining to Negative Security Assurances, as we view the provision of Negative Security Assurances as an important and achievable step towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We hope that other Nuclear Weapon States would follow suit and also support such efforts on Negative Security Assurances.
Mr Chairman,
This Review Conference should contribute to enhancing the safety and security of the international community and further promote the disarmament and non- proliferation agenda. We hope that the NPT Review Conference would set the pace and be an example to other disarmament fora. We would like to see progress at the Conference on Disarmament, particularly, with regard to the immediate commencement of negotiations on a Treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes. We also support the decision to re-establish an Ad Hoc Committee on Negative Security Assurances in the Conference on Disarmament with a mandate to negotiate. On another issue, we hope immediate steps will be taken to ensure the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and that Nuclear Weapon States continue their moratorium on nuclear testing.
Mr Chairman,
The 2010 NPT Review Conference must address the issue of compliance to the Treaty - disarmament compliance and non-proliferation compliance. We have heard in the past months positive pronouncements and have seen positive actions, slowly pushing the disarmament agenda forward.
The Review Conference in 2015 will judge us on our success and failures. We can either choose to work together and fulfill our responsibilities and commitments or choose to continue rhetoric for the next five years. There is no other recourse, if we want to maintain and strengthen the NPT - and if we want humanity to live on. Our time to act is now. Rest assured, Mr. Chairman, that Malaysia stands ready to work and engage constructively with you and other States Parties in meeting our common objectives.
I thank you Mr Chairman
