The Preparatory Committee for the 2020 Review Conference of the
Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Second Session
23 April-4 May 2018, Geneva

Cluster II (Specific Issues â€“ the Middle East)

Mr. Chairman.

We believe that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free-zones (NWFZ) will
eventually take us one step closer to our shared goal of a world free of nuclear
weapons. Such zones not only enhance and complement the current disarmament and
nonproliferation regime, but also help build trust and confidence among the countries
in the region.

In this context, the Republic of Korea has consistently supported the establishment of
a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). In
particular, creating such a zone in the Middle East tops our priority as has been agreed
and reaffirmed in multiple NPT review conference outcome documents, including,
inter alia, the 1995 resolution on the Middle East and the 2010 Action Plan.

Regrettably, however, the conference envisioned by the 2010 NPT Review Conference
Plan of Action has not been convened to date. In the run up to the 2020 Review
Conference, we should neither remain complacent nor allow frustration and
disappointment to overshadow the whole review cycle. More critically, the continuing
instability in the region highlights the urgent need to make definitive stride on this
issue.

As we have turned the halfway point of this review cycle, the Republic of Korea looks
forward to the early convening of a conference on the establishment of a Middle East
Zone free of nuclear weapons and other WMDs, to be attended by all States of the
region on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by them, and hopes that a real
turning point on this issue can be made before the end of this cycle. Thank you. /End/
