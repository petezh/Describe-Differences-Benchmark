STATEMENT
By Mr. Vu Tran Phong
Delegate of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam
On Safeguards at the 2017 NPT Preparatory Committee Session
(Vienna, Austria, 2-12 May 2017)
Mr. Chairman,
Viet Nam fully supports nuclear disarmament, nuclear
non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy.
We are of the view that nuclear non-proliferation should not
undermine the inalienable rights of States to use nuclear energy and
nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
The IAEA is the sole competent authority for verification of
compliance with the obligations under the respective Safeguard
Agreements of the Member States.
Regarding the Safeguards implementation, Viet Nam wishes to
express that IAEA should implement safeguards in compliance with its
Statute and Safeguards Agreement in a fair, objective, technical
credibility and non-discriminatory manner on the basis of objective
information source in accordance with Safeguards Agreement and
Additional Protocol.
The collection of information of State concerned conducted by
IAEA should be on the same basis: objectivity, non-discriminatory and
technical credibility.
Viet Nam ratified the IAEA Additional Protocol in
September 2012 and Viet Nam strengthens cooperation with IAEA to
implement Safeguards effectively in accordance with interests of
Viet Nam.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
