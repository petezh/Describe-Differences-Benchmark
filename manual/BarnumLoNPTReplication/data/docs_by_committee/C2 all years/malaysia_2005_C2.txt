Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
Malaysia is taking the floor to address the issue of safeguards. Malaysia had addressed separately the regional issues including the Middle East, in the Subsidiary Body 2 meeting this morning.
Mr. Chairman,
Since the last Review Conference in 2000, there had been a number of major developments of utmost concern in the area of NPT safeguards verification. Malaysia welcomes the decision of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Iran to sign the Additional Protocol to the NPT Safeguards Agreement in December 2003. Malaysia encourages Iran to continue its cooperation with the IAEA, and undertake all necessary corrective measures towards satisfactory resolution of relevant outstanding issues. We believe that the increased cooperation on the part of Iran will lead to an improved chapter of confidence and interaction between Iran and the IAEA.

Malaysia recognizes the objective of the Additional Protocol in strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system towards achieving global nuclear non-proliferation objectives. However, Malaysia wishes to reiterate its main concern on the subjective nature of the description of the items listed in Annex II to the Additional Protocol. We remain convinced that it would be difficult for the front-line enforcement personnel to identify and effectively implement the control of such items as even the nuclear scientist would have difficulties in identifying those items. There would also be lack of awareness and knowledge gap among the local industries in ensuring a smooth implementation of such an extended nuclear export and import control

 
system. This is true even for States Parties with Additional Protocol and export control legislation in force.
In this regard, Malaysia wishes to reiterate its call for better co-ordination between the IAEA and other relevant international agencies, including the World Customs Organization (WCO), to harmonize the items listed in Annex II of the Protocol with international customs coding systems, so as to facilitate its implementation by national enforcement agencies.
Mr. Chairman,
Malaysia is concerned that attempts are being made to narrow the inalienable rights of non-nuclear weapon States through the development of unilateral export control and counter-proliferation regimes outside the framework of the NPT. Malaysia emphasizes that the export control regimes should be transparent and open to participation by all States and should ensure that they do not impose restrictions on access to material, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes required by developing countries for their continued development. In this regard, Malaysia is of the view that proliferation concerns are best addressed through multilateral negotiated, universal, comprehensive and non-discriminatory agreements for example through the United Nations.
Malaysia is equally concerned over the simultaneous efforts that are being pursued in another forum by the nuclear-weapon States, to legitimize the transport of equipment, materials, software or related technology intended to be used in the delivery of nuclear weapons, beyond any of the provisions under the NPT. Malaysia views the inclusion of any such provision in the current review of the 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA Convention) or any other international instrument, as not only a dangerous precedent, but also a very unbecoming backhanded attempt to undermine the disarmament obligations under the NPT by the nuclear weapon States.
Mr. Chairman,
Malaysia stresses the importance of achieving a universal application of the NPT. In realizing this, we are of the view that the nuclear-weapon States need to go beyond voluntary offers of partial safeguards. The nuclear-weapon States should accept full-scope safeguards that would effectively strengthen the overall NPT verification regime. We are convinced that this could be set forth in an appropriate agreement to be negotiated and concluded with the IAEA in accordance with the Statute of the IAEA and its safeguards system.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Malaysia is taking the floor to address the regional issues, in particular on the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones.
Mr. Chairman,
Malaysia fully supports the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zone in. various regions around the world, which is in consistent with the spirit embodied, in Article VII of the NPT and also in the Principles and Decisions of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference.
Malaysia is pleased to note the full entry into force of the Tlatelolco Treaty in its area of application following the ratification by Cuba. Malaysia calls on all regional States to the treaties of Rarotonga and Pelindaba to expedite their signature and ratification to those treaties. Malaysia also urges the nuclear- weapon States to become parties to the relevant Protocols to the treaties of Tlatelolco, Rarotonga, Bangkok and Pelindaba.
Malaysia is of the view that each nuclear-weapon-free zone is a critical piece of a global jigsaw puzzle that would eventually form a nuclear-weapon-free world. With this in mind, Malaysia therefore reaffirms the need for the establishment of new nuclear-weapon-free zones in region where they do not exist, especially in volatile regions such as the Middle East, South Asia and Northeast Asia

Mr. Chairman,
5. Turning to the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula, Malaysia views the Six Party Talks as a very positive step towards a peaceful and diplomatic solution of the issue. In this regard, Malaysia calls on all parties directly concerned to refrain from provocative action and demonstrate flexibility in creating favourable conditions to enable the resumption of the Six Party Talks.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Malaysia is taking the floor to address the issue of the Middle East in the light of the implementation of the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East and the 2000 outcome of the NPT Review Conference.
Mr. Chairman,
Malaysia fully supports all efforts towards establishing a nuclear-weapon- free zone in the Middle East. As such, Malaysia calls up on all parties concerned to take urgent and practical steps towards the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions adopted by consensus as well as the Security Council resolution 487(1981) and paragraph 14 of the Security Council resolution 687(1991).

Malaysia is greatly concerned over the acquisition of nuclear capability by Israel. This development poses serious negative implications on the regional security as well as on the integrity of the global non-proliferation regime.

In this regard, Malaysia urges Israel to renounce possession of nuclear weapons; to accede to the NPT without delay; to place promptly all its nuclear facilities under the IAEA full-scope safeguards; and to conduct its nuclear related activities in conformity with the non-proliferation regime.
Pending the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, Malaysia also calls for the total and complete prohibition of the transfer of all nuclear-related equipment, information, material and facilities, resources or devices and the extension of assistance in the nuclear related scientific or technological fields to Israel.
Finally, Mr. Chairman, the position of the NAM States Parties on the issue of the Middle East had been underlined during Malaysia's presentation of NAM'S Working Paper No. 19 last week. The fact that many States Parties had addressed the issue of the Middle East throughout is testimony to the crucial importance of the establishment of a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in the Middle East to the lasting peace of the region.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
