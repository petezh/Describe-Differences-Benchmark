STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR FRANCIS K. BUTAGIRA, UGANDA
PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE TO IAEA
CLUSTER II ISSUES - NON PROLIERATION

Mr. Chairman,
Uganda fully supports the mandate of IAEA in implementing the treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in particular in assisting States with regard to
the establishment of Nuclear Weapons Free Zones, and safe guard regimes.

We call on those countries which have not established Nuclear Free Zones to do
so. We stress however that the establishment of Nuclear Free Zones should in no
way diminish on the responsibility of Nuclear Weapons States to fully commit to
disarmament as per their obligations under the treaty. We believe in a world free
of nuclear weapons. The monopoly by Nuclear Weapons

States only serves to

promote an arms race in Nuclear Weapons, that's why we believe in total
disarmament.

With regard to safe guards, Uganda calls on those States who have not done so,
to conclude as soon as possible the safe guard agreements.
Uganda calls on States parties to adhere to the safeguard regime put in place by
IAEA. For the effective implementation of the safe guard regime, it is important to
provide IAEA with adequate and predictable funding which among other things
would enable IAEA to implement its Technical cooperation arrangements.

Lastly, Uganda stress the importance of supporting IAEA in its efforts for
application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes including poverty eradication
in developing countries especially in the fields of agriculture and health.

Thank you.
