the statements made on behalf of the NonA · ed · q. ement and the Arab Group related to the establishment of a
zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction.
Egypt is of the view that the establishment of a WMD free zone in
the Middle East should remain a central topic in the current NPT review
cycle, not only because of its political and security merits, but more
importantly, because the 1995 Resolution -on the Middle East was an
essential element of the outcome of the 1995 Review and Extension
Conference on the basis of which the NPT was indefinitely extended.
My delegation stands ready to engage in good faith, once again, with
all delegations that are sincere in their endeavors to establish a zone free of
nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle
East and to cooperate with them with the energy and commitment this
issue deserves.
Mr. Chairman,

The delay in the implementation of the '1995 Resolution has eroded
the credibility of the NPT and may ·potentially represent yet another
setback in the NPT review process. We must ensure that this issue receives
commitment to guarantee a meaningful and successful outcome of the
2020 NPT Review Conference. I would like to underline that the 2000 and
2010 NPT Review Conferences emphasized the importance of th,e
Resolution on the Middle East and affirmed its goals and objectives. They
stressed that the Resolution remains valid until the goals and objectives
are achieved.
The 2020 Review Conference therefore, should adopt clear
modalities and practical steps on launching negotiations aimed at the
prompt implementation of the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East. We
stress the special responsibility of the three co-sponsors of the 1995
Resolution of the Middle East to implement the Resolution. In this regard,
we would like to highlight that the Non Aligned Movement has put
forward a clear proposal on modalities to launch negotiations on the
implementation
of the 1995 Resolution based on consensus and
arrangements freely arrived at by the states of the region as contained in
working paper NPT/CONF.2020/PC.II/WP.16
J( i p

.

Mr. Chairman,

Egypt stresses the urgency and importance of the early realization of
universal adherence to the NPT. We call on all States, in particular in the
Middle East, that had not yet done so to accede to the Treaty as nonnuclear weapon States so as to achieve its universality at an early date. In
this line, we recall that the 1995, 2000, and 2010 Review Conferences
reaffirmed the importance of Israel's accession to the NPT and the
placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive IAEA
safeguards. Regrettably, no progress has 'been achieved so far with regard
to Israel's accession to the Treaty. Despite the collective adherence by
every Arab state to the Treaty, Israel remains the only country that rejects
accession to the NPT. At a time when the international community works
to address other regional nonproliferation cases, it is essential that issues
related to nonproliferation are addressed comprehensively.
Egypt demands that the ongoing NPT review cycle calls on Israel to
accede to the NPT without any precondition or further delay as a nonnuclear weapon State, place promptly all its nuclear facilities under the
IAEA full-scope safeguards in accordance with Security Council
Resolution 487 (1981) and conduct all its nuclear-related activities in full
conformity with the non-proliferation regime, in realizing the goal of
universal adherence to the Treaty.
Mr. Chairman,

Attempts to create linkages between the establishment of the free
zone in the Middle East with a number of issues that fall clearly beyond
the capacity of the NPT review process to address Qs not only
unconstructive, it\i-iinders possible future progress on establishing the
zone. The 1995 Csolution should remain the primary terms of reference
~~so~ution.
and the scope of issues limited to the contents of the~

9:5
µ~;vvrJt

It is for this reason that my delegatio~ js~by
the proposal
suggestecl by one of the co-sponsors of the 1995Resolution in one of its
working papers related to the issue of the establishment of a WMD free
zone in the Middle East. The ideas raised ~ in i.W-working
paper goes far beyond the scope of the 1995 Resolution and comprises a
set of issues which incapacitates the NPT review cycle to address the
WMD free zone in the Middle East, rather than benefit it. Mfmushingly,

/4~<¼
the working paper ~g

that the "NPT review cycle is,l!L
suited to resolving' ' the issue of the Middle East, in total disregard of tfiat
delegation's co-sponsorship of the 1995 resolution and the consensus
· agreed upon by all NPT state parties of the centrality of the issue of the
WMD zone in the Middle East within the NPT review conference. This
approach can jeopardize the success of the ongoing review cycle and risk
another failure which we aspire to avoid in order to preserve the
credibility of the Treaty.
Mr. Chairman,
There is a collective responsibility to ensure that the 1995 Resolution
is implemented . Disregarding previous obligations not only puts review
cycles under stress, it erodes the credibility of the NPT as the cornerstone
of the nuclear disarmament nonproliferation regime.

Thank you.
