

Mr Chairman,
I wish to welcome you to the Chair of this Subsidiary Body of Main Committee II and pledge the support of the United Kingdom delegation to your efforts for its success.
Mr Chairman,
I wish to make it clear from the outset of this statement that the United Kingdom does not accept, as some distinguished speakers have claimed earlier today, that our co-sponsorship of the Resolution on the Middle East at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference as a Depositary state of the Treaty means that the United Kingdom has any special responsibility towards the Resolution.
Operative paragraph 6 of the Resolution is clear. It calls upon all States parties to the Treaty and in particular the nuclear-weapon States to extend their cooperation and to exert their utmost efforts with a view to ensuring the early establishment by regional parties of a Middle East Zone free of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.
Our discussion at this Review Conference needs to take account of this wider remit, including universal adherence to the Chemical and Biological Conventions and restraint in ballistic missile systems.
Mr Chairman,
The support given by the United Kingdom in various multilateral fora to finding a solution to the problems of the Middle East is documented in NPT/CONF.2000/7. I have no need to elaborate on this. But I do wish to state categorically that the United Kingdom is in total compliance with its obligations under the NPT.
Mr Chairman,
We made it clear in our national statement delivered last Monday, and will do so again in national papers which will be circulated shortly, that we call on Israel to adhere to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State and to place all its nuclear facilities under full-scope IAEA safeguards. We are ready to see such a call reflected in the documentation of this Body and of the Conference as a whole.
We welcome the accession by Djibouti, Oman and the United Arab Emirates to the Treaty, and the conclusion by Jordan of its Additional Protocol with the IAEA. But we note that according to the report of the activities of the IAEA circulated as NPT/CONF.2000/9, as of 31 December 1999 Bahrain, Djibouti, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen have not negotiated full-scope safeguards agreements with the IAEA.
The United Kingdom would welcome clarification of this issue with a view to accurately reflecting the current position in any document going forward from this Body.
Mr Chairman,
The distinguished Representative of Egypt, in his statement earlier today, proposed inter alia the sending of a Special Envoy to the Middle East in the next review period with the task of assisting the States of the region in their endeavours to establish a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction. The United Kingdom believes that under certain circumstances this could be a positive move, but would wish to have further details, eg on the mandate of the Special Envoy and financing, before making a firm commitment to the idea.
Mr Chairman,
The issues in the Middle East of relevance to the NPT go far wider than those I have mentioned today. Non-compliance with the NPT is of importance to my delegation. We look forward to discussion of these issues at our later meetings, leading to a balanced review of the operation of the Treaty and its associated documents and decisions as they pertain to regional issues.
