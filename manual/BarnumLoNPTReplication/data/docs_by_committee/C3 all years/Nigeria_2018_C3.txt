Thank you Chairman,
Nigeria aligns itself with the statement delivered under
this cluster by the delegation of Indonesia on behalf of the
Group of Non Aligned State Parties to the NPT. We also
endorse the working paper by the Non Aligned Movement State
Parties on the "the inalienable right to peaceful research,
production and uses of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes".
We endorse as well, the joint working paper submitted by the
members of the NPDI on peaceful uses. In our national
capacity, we would like to add the following:
2.

My delegation would like to once again underscore the

uniqueness and importance of the NPT. Besides serving as an
important cornerstone in global peace and security, the grand
bargain of the treaty, which assures of the right of State Parties
to pursue the use of nuclear energy applications for their
developmental aspirations, makes the treaty a timeless and
continually relevant instrument.
3.

In recent years, more developing countries including

Nigeria are embracing nuclear technology to meet their
developmental needs, especially in important areas such as
human and animal health, water conservation, agriculture and
1

power generation. This is as it should be; indeed, peaceful uses
are the only legitimate manner in which the potential of nuclear
technology should be applied.
4.

We reiterate that the right of all parties to this treaty to

develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity
with Article IV, should continue to be respected and deepened
by the NPT community.
5.

The right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy is as

inalienable as it is a sovereign choice. However, once the
choice is made, the necessity for international cooperation
cannot be over emphasised. In this regard, my delegation
highlights the valuable role of the International Atomic Energy
Agency in providing support to member states through the
Technical Cooperation Programme.
6.

In

this context, we welcome the

scheduled IAEA

International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Science and
Technology Technical Cooperation and look forward to its
contribution to the strengthening of the IAEA'sPeaceful Uses
Programme and its delivery mechanism.
7.

My delegation is also aware of the huge level of support

from various Member States and donors whose continued
support makes the Technical Cooperation Programme and

exists could only be filled by concerted efforts towards more
technology transfer and accelerated programmes of capacity
building and cooperation.

Mr. Chairman,
8.

My delegation believes that

Nuclear Science and

Technology could play an important role as states strive to
actualize the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development (SDGs). Accordingly, we urge all states to do all
that they can to ensure that access to the benefits made
available by peaceful uses of nuclear energy are enlarged to
the greatest extent possible.
9.

Nuclear Energy is clean, viable and environment and

climate friendly. Recalling the 2015 landmark Paris Agreement
on Climate Change, we therefore urge more cooperation in
enabling access to nuclear energy in the energy mix of
interested countries. This would conform not only with the
relevant articles of the NPT, but also further the commitments
of State Parties to the Paris Agreement.
10. Nigeria, like many other developing countries, is faithful to
her obligations under the NPT. Not only have we renounced the
nuclear weapons option, we have signed and ratified the
African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone also known as the
3

PelindabaTreaty. In addition, we are also in compliancewith
our relevant Safeguards obligations. Consequently, it is our
expectation that the concomitant right to peaceful uses without
any form of inhibition or conditionality would be fully respected
and supported.
11. On a final note, Mr. Chairman, Disarmament and
Non-Proliferation are important because they both seek to rid
the world of nuclear weapons and thus guarantee security.
However, it is the Peaceful Uses pillar that possesses the
inherent

capability to

accelerate the development and

prosperity of the world, thus guaranteeing in its own way,
human socio-economicsecurity and development.
12. Nigeria hopes that this PREPCOM
will reset the tone that
will lead to the review cycle coming up with clear concrete
measures that further preserve and facilitate the rights of
states to peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
I thank you.
