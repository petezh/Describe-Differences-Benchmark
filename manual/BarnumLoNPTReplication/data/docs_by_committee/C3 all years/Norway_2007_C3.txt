Mr. Chair,
Norway fully supports the inalienable right to peaceful use as stipulated in Article IV of the NPT and in conformity with articles I, II and III of the Treaty.
Civilian nuclear applications are much more than nuclear energy. Norway attaches great importance in facilitating the use of nuclear technology for all - in the health sector, agriculture, water management and environmental monitoring. Peaceful nuclear applications represent an important contribution to our joint efforts at reaching the UN Millennium Development Goals.
The use of nuclear energy is estimated to increase greatly in the years to come. While nuclear energy may have a positive impact on efforts to reduce emission of green house gases, there are also severe environmental implications. Ways to handle the large and increasing quantities of nuclear waste in all its aspects in a safe, secure and environmentally sound way must be found. Sufficient resources must be set aside in the search of sustainable and environmentally sound solutions.
Our Cluster III Working Paper has a particular focus on nuclear safety. This is an issue which Norway highlights within the Board of Governors in the IAEA. We attach particular importance in ensuring predictable and sufficient funding for safety activities of the IAEA,
