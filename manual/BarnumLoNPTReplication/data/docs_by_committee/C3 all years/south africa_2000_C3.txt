
Mr Chairperson,
May I congratulate you and your two Vice Chairs on the assumption of your important positions. Please be assured of my delegation's cooperation and support.
Mr Chairperson,
With the splitting of the atom, almost universal optimism existed that the world's energy problems would be solved and that the peaceful uses of nuclear energy would become the magic key that could unlock new doors to a better future for all. Since that time, nuclear technology applications have moved from research laboratories to routine use in hospitals, farms, industrial enterprises and universities. Isotopes and radiation applications have come to play an important role in the technologies that are engaged in providing humanity with basic requirements for their well being, such as food, water and a satisfactory standard of health.
Mr Chairperson,
On the African continent the application of nuclear technology has in many instances brought viable solutions to some of the problems that we are confronting. In this connection, South Africa would wish to commend the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which, through its Technical Cooperation Programme, makes a meaningful contribution in key areas vital to sustainable development. It is with satisfaction that South Africa noted that a record implementation level of 76% was reported to the Board of Governors Meeting in June last year.
Significant progress has already been made over the past few years in reaching across the borders of countries in Africa to address regional aspirations and needs by means of the Technical Cooperation Programme. The African region has greatly succeeded in tailoring a common approach to the utilization of the peaceful uses of nuclear science through the work and activities of the African Regional Cooperative Agreement for Research, Development and Training related to Science and Technology (AFRA). This unique Agreement is an inter-governmental pact of mutual assistance in the field of nuclear science and technology that brings together in one forum the scientific experts of Africa. Within this forum, opportunities are presented to address mutual problems and find common solutions for the benefit of the continent as a whole. The establishment of Specialized Teams to carry out missions in Member States to solve urgent problems such as dam leakage detection and the conditioning and safe storage of radioactive sources, are commendable developments with laudable results. During 1999, Specialized Teams were sent on 14 missions and about 270 items of equipment were repaired. The past year also witnessed an implementation rate for AFRA projects of about 80%.
The IAEA's involvement in AFRA provides the necessary stimulus for activities in this area of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Over the last five years, the Agency has been assisting AFRA Member States through the AFRA Project Formulation Committee in the conceptual design and formulation of new projects under the four identified AFRA themes. These themes relate to radiation safety, human health, increasing agricultural productivity and industrial applications. This assistance included support for the AFRA project Formulation Committees to meet in AFRA Member States together with the Agency technical and administrative staff to discharge the above tasks. During the period of 1995 - 2000, and through the utilization of this mechanism with the IAEA, fourteen projects under the four themes having a high socio-economic impact for the end-users in the AFRA Member States, were designed and formulated.
Mr Chairperson,
Turning now in more detail to the IAEA's Technical Assistance Programme, South Africa feels it opportune to commend the Agency for its increased focus on accepting only Technical Cooperation projects with sustainable socio-economic benefits on regional and so-called model projects. With the better management of the programme and the funds assigned to it, the situation can improve to an acceptable level of supply in terms of the demand for TC services. The transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful uses is, after all, one of the cornerstones of the IAEA Statute.
Within the framework of the existing TC Model Projects, South Africa is strongly committed to education and training in radiological protection and nuclear safety, to supporting the establishment -- in collaboration with the IAEA -- of an African Regional Centre for Radiation protection and Training in South Africa. The first four-month post graduate educational course in radiation protection was presented from July to October 1999 at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. South Africa is highly appreciative for the assistance provided by the Agency in the establishment of this important Centre of Excellence.
Other successful projects currently being implemented in South Africa include the Sterile Insect Technique on Fruit Flies, new screening methods to detect drug resistance in Tuberculosis patients within two days, and neo-natal screening techniques. All these projects are aimed at bettering the quality of life of many South Africans.
Mr Chairperson,
Although I have earlier referred to the high rate of TC implementation -- that was made possible by contributions from both donor and receiver countries during the past year -- I still believe that there are danger signals that we need to focus upon. It is evident that problems could arise in the implementation of the Technical Assistance Programme unless steps are taken to ensure that the level of the TC fund continues to rise at an appropriate rate so as to enable it to fund the vital projects within the Programme. A lack of, or decline in, funding for this most important function of the IAEA may be interpreted as a lack of commitment to the question of Technical Cooperation. This situation would be very unfortunate, viewed against the achievement of the record TC implementation rate in the previous cycle. I would, therefore wish to appeal to all -- but especially the major donors -- to ensure that their dues to the TCF are paid in full and on time. Through such a commitment, the international community can be assured that funding for these vital projects is predictable and assured.
Mr Chairperson,
It is the task of the international community to ensure that humanity prospers from the advantages of radioactivity, by perfecting ways of minimizing its risks and maximizing its benefits. It is through learning from one another, through ensuring that nuclear science and technology is not misappropriated or used for non-peaceful purposes, through ensuring that nuclear science and technology is shared and not only there to benefit the few, that this science and technology will contribute towards healthier, safer and more prosperous communities. We bear a collective responsibility towards future generations to strive to bequeath to them a better world than the one we inherited. To bequeath to them a world where life is not threatened by the military ambition of nuclear weapons, but where the quality of life is enhanced by the peaceful application of nuclear science.
Finally, Mr Chairperson, I wish to state that South Africa intends submitting a Working Paper for Main Committee III's consideration. This Working Paper provides South Africa's views on, and draft language for, the forward looking elements of our work. The draft language that is provided is based on, and attempts to improve on, the existing language that is included on the peaceful uses issue in the Principles and Objectives. It would be appreciated if the Secretariat could circulate the Working Paper as an official document of this Main Committee.
Mr Chairperson, I thank you.
