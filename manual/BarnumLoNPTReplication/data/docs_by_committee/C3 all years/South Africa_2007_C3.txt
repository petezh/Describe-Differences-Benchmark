Chairperson,
My delegation fully associates itself with the statement delivered by Cuba or, benah of the Non-Aiigrea Movement on the peaceful uses of nuclear technology.
South Africa is of the view that the NPT's role in promoting international peace ano security is based on indelicate balance of the Treaty's three pillars of non-proliferation, disarmament ana the peaceful uses cf nuclear energy. Article IV of the NPT states in no uncertain terms that nothing n t ie Treaty snal! be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all Parties to develop research, procuct'cn and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles i and :l of the Treaty
Chairperson,
South Africa will continue to promote international co-operation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities. envisaged in Article III (3) of the NPT and also encourages the exchange of scientific information, particularly Africa, for the further development of the applications of atomic energy for peaceful pumoses sn accordance wit-preambular paragraph 7 of the Treaty. Since 1993 there has been development of the South African PeDD?e Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) which entails the building of a demonstration reactor p-oiect near Cape Tow and a pilot fuel plant near Pretoria. According to the current schedule, constructor, w»i commence m 2C08 and it is expected that the demonstration plant will be completed in 2012 The tost commercial PBMR modules are planned for 2016. South Africa intends to eventually produce approximated up to 5000 MW .>i power from pebble bed reactors in South Africa, which would mean between 20 and j ) PBMR reactors ui 165 MW each.
South Africa highly appreciates the assistance being rendered by the International Xtom.c Energy Agency i developing the PBMR project in keeping with the International Atomic Energy Agenov s (IAEA) statutory mandate to pursue technical co-operation in the peaceful application of nuclear energy Np also commena ro assistance provided by the IAEA to developing countries in planning for and the jse or nuclear science a-m technology for various peaceful purposes. This is especially relevant in the contex* of acnieving social an1 economic goals, including, inter alia, for the generation of electricity, and also to faoi irate trie transfer of suo~ technology and knowledge in a sustainable manner.
Chairperson,
My delegation is of the view that safety and security aspects are interlinked ano neea to be addressed simultaneously. South Africa takes note of the good record of global nuclear safetv performance, but wo od warn about possible complacency. Our own recent experience with the shutdown c* one unit at the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station reflects how important it is to make sure that emergency preparedness ano responses are in place and functional. We all need to ensure that our emergency response programmes am constantly updated and adapted to the latest state-of-the-art. We encourage States oames to make use of the Agency's support of national activities, such as training courses and emergence exercises, which como include participation by local organizations and population.
South Africa will also organize the IAEA's Postgraduate Course on Radiation Protection n July this year as a contribution towards regional capacity building in regulatory frameworks and infrastructure Last year me South African Government published the Radioactive Waste Management Policy ano Strategy and we sre now in the final stages of drafting the necessary legislation that will give effect to those policy pr ovisions, m November 2006, South Africa deposited its Instrument of Accession to the Joint Convention with the IAEA thus underpinning our serious commitment as a responsible state in the area of Radioactive Waste Management. [The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNVU's expected to De ratified in April 2007],
Chairperson,
There is recognition that energy security is one of the most pressing challenges that we are confronted w-tb Energy security remains indispensable for the maintenance and improvement of the auai-ty of the lives of cm people. One of the elements of ensuring energy security is the sustainable utihsat.on of primary energ ,< sources by a country. In this connection, plans are on track in South Africa to declare uranium as a strategy mineral. To this end studies are currently also being conducted to determine the c oom and feasibility of recommencing fuel cycle activities and the possible benefit it may hold for South Afuca The ultimate goal South Africa is to realise localisation of fabrication of nuclear components involved >n aspects of nuoesr power generation and the nuclear fuel cycle.
It is within this context that South Africa is closely following the discussions and o-opcsass on inieraat,o-a: fuel cycle facilities and fuel assurances. In this respect, my delegation is of the view that 3 safe orderly systerr. to fuel civilian nuclear reactors is needed that would not add to the danger of nuclear weapon proliferation However, States should have reliable access, at reasonable cost, to fuel for civilian reactors Several countries-have such facilities, and the objective should not be to maintain the status quo - it shou .1 ds equitaDie - any distinction made in this regard would only exacerbate existing inequalities.
Chairperson,
The peaceful application of nuclear energy is of particular relevance and importance to Africa given the urge;-: need for sustainable and accelerated economic growth on the Continent. In this co"te>t. a number of IAEA projects are of strategic importance to developing countries, particularly in Africa, and can provide the necessary impetus for accelerated sustainable economic development, thereby playing a rreaningful roie in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and enhancing the New Partnership for Africa c Development (NEPAD). My delegation would encourage the widest possible involvement of aii States Pasties, particularly developing countries, in the ongoing research and development activities of th- IAEA.
South Africa believes that the IAEA's Technical Co-operation activities have the potentia' to make a substantia' contribution in this regard, as well as in the application of nuciear techniques in combating the occurrence of infectious diseases such as TB, malaria, and HIV/AIDS, which continue to hamper economic prosperity and development in many parts of the world. The Technical Co-operation projects of the Agency are therefeo more than just political commitments. They constitute important building blocks to a m-ve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Agency's projects address many of the MDGs esp-miy in the areas A water, environmental sustainability, combating disease, hunger and poverty natem.m health and oh A: health. To reach the goals set out in the Millennium Declaration by 2015, we must ommm.i>-; to assure tne mn implementation of the Agency's technical assistance programme to the bene** c* enveloping and i:, particular least developed countries.
Over the years, developing countries have repeatedly stressed the need for the mnmng of the Agency s Technical Co-operation projects to be sufficient, predictable and assured. They have ui$r stressed the need for the Technical Co-operation budget to be increased as it is clearly not sutf'ciK-.t Although it s acknowledged that contributions to the Technical Co-operation Fund is currently voluntary my Delegation reiterates its view that we need to allocate more resources that would provide ossured and predictable funding to enable the Agency to undertake its statutory mandate "to seek to acc derate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world'
Chairperson,
In conclusion, South Africa believes that the strength and credibility of the NPT rests on a fundamental bargain which must be recognized and upheld if we want the Treaty to be effective by virtue or us own ,rents rather "her. to let it be used to serve selective interests through the perpetuation of discrimination and unbalance Fh<? peaceful use of nuclear energy is an integral part of this equation.
It remains a concern that while demands are being made for non-nuclear-weapon States to agree to new measures in the name of non-proliferation, concrete actions towards nuclear disarmament am neglected. South Africa wishes to reiterate that it cannot support unwarranted restrictions on the NPT's guaranteed access to soon nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes by States that are fully compliant with their obiqat<ons under the NPT The imposition of additional restrictive measures on some NPT States Parties while a.icwmg others to have access to these capabilities, only serves to exacerbate existing inequalities that are already innerent in the NF r and undermines one of the central bargains that are contained in the Treaty.
