Mr President,
For a number of years, energy production from nuclear fuel has clearly become the objective of a growing number of States due to the growing demand for electricity, the dwindling of reserves of hydrocarbons, and ecological imperatives. Alone In the period between the 2008 session of the Preparatory Committee and this year's session, more than a dozen contracts to develop civilian nuclear programmes have been concluded in different developing countries.
Mr President,
This nuclear "renaissance" - or more accurately for some States, this nuclear "naissance" -has not come about without a number of different kinds of problem, of which we would like to identify three:
■	First. It is not entirely illogical to make a link between a quantitative increase in civilian nuclear programmes and a corresponding increase in the risk of nuclear proliferation.
■	Second. This increase in the number of civilian nuclear programmes will bring with it a corresponding increase in the demand for nuclear fuel, which raises questions concerning the exponential growth in nuclear facilities with sensitive technologies, in particular in the enriching and recycling fields.
■	Third. This quantitative increase in civilian nuclear programmes, especially in developing countries, also harbours risks in terms of security and safety.
Mr President,
For some of these challenges - in particular the increased risk of nuclear proliferation -instruments to strengthen confidence in the peaceful use of nuclear energy have been developed during the last forty years by the States Parties to the NPT. My country encourages all States Parties of the NPT that have not already done so to accede to all these instruments.
Mr President,
On the subject of sensitive technologies of the nuclear fuel cycle, we are touching on a discussion which - although not new - will perhaps lead to the implementation of new structures under the formula commonly known as "multilateral approaches".
Since the publication of the report in 2005 by the group of experts of the IAEA, more than ten initiatives have been launched in this area, either by States individually or as groups of States. However, since 2005, this discussion has created a certain malaise among some States Parties not in possession of sensitive nuclear technologies. To us, the reasons for this appear to be the following:
■	These discussions are perceived primarily as an attempt by those States in possession of sensitive nuclear technologies to limit access for those States not in possession of these technologies on the pretext of reducing the risk of proliferation although the main reasons seem more likely to be economic.
■	These discussions are also seen by many developing countries as slowing down their progress and as an attempt to prolong their technological subservience. An illustration of this is the continued pressure currently being applied by some States to increase the IAEA's verification activities to the detriment of its primary activities of nuclear cooperation.
■	Since the decision taken by the NSG in August 2008 to no longer request the application of full-scope safeguards as a condition for cooperation in the nuclear field with India, these discussions can be perceived as double standard which is not helpful when it comes to encouraging some States Parties to keep accepting the principles of the fundamental bargain on which the NPT is based.
■	Finally, these discussions are felt by many non-nuclear weapons States as a further request to forgo their rights as set out in Article IV even though the nuclear weapons States are far from fulfilling their commitment for nuclear disarmament according to Article VI.
Switzerland is open for a discussion on all aspects of the subject of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, whether of a technical, commercial or legal nature. Nevertheless, for reasons concerning the diversification of the market, at this point in time we do not envisage to support proposals that would have the effect of strengthening the monopoly of those States in possession of sensitive nuclear technologies, or proposals that aim in principle to restrict the inalienable rights stipulated in Article IV of the NPT.
Mr President,
The risks in terms of security and safety constitute an aspect of the same importance as
the risks of proliferation. Let's just consider quite simply the fact that in the next three decades, the number of nuclear power plants in operation may triple and that the countries most concerned will be developing countries. It will be a major challenge to ensure that these newcomers have the capacities in terms of national expertise to enable them to define their precise needs, technical know-how, human resources, reliable infrastructure, risk controls, implementing the various international conventions and regulations, policy on waste products, and finally managing their "nuclear memory" over the long term, because the choice of the nuclear path is a choice for several centuries. The danger is high that huge financial and strategic interests will relegate to second priority these kinds of concerns.
Mr President,
To us, the conclusions are ultimately the same whether they are seen in terms of responsibility towards the risk of proliferation, access to sensitive technologies, or questions of security and safety. The peaceful use of nuclear energy can provide considerable benefits to humanity, however at the same it harbours a potential for indiscriminate damage. As a consequence, States using nuclear energy, those supplying technologies, as well as nuclear-industry leaders all share an enormous responsibility. Expansion of the civilian nuclear energy industry must neither contribute to the development of a new high-risk geopolitical environment nor take place without an in-depth debate with the aim of making all the actors concerned aware of their responsibilities. It is important that States supplying technologies are not satisfied only with the short-term financial advantages. It is essential that they put in place, together with the recipient states, a genuine policy of technological development and cooperation in civilian nuclear technology that incorporates all the parameters of proliferation, safety and security.
In this age of globalisation, the peaceful use of nuclear energy is more than ever before a matter of global responsibility.
Thank you for your attention.
