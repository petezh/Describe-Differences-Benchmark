As a strong advocate of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), New Zealand recognises the importance of full implementation of all three pillars of the Treaty - nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses. It is only through equal implementation of each of these pillars that our shared objective of a nuclear weapons free world will be realised.
New Zealand acknowledges the right of all States party to the Treaty to be able to develop, research, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in conformity with Articles I, II and III of the Treaty. New Zealand has rejected nuclear power generation for itself, as we do not believe that nuclear power is compatible with the concept of sustainable development, given the long-term costs, both financial and ecological, of nuclear waste and the risk of nuclear proliferation. It is our view that there are other, more sustainable energy sources that could be developed, and that any responsible discussion about nuclear power should be balanced, and include consideration of the serious risks and costs as well as any potential benefits.
Mr Chairman
It is in our common interest to ensure that peaceful uses of nuclear technology remain accessible to all States parties while at the same time ensuring that such technologies do not contribute towards the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is important therefore that peaceful nuclear activities are conducted against a backdrop of robust system of safeguards.
New Zealand is of the view that any multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle should be developed with due regard to the inalienable right of States Party to the NPT to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, in conformity with the NPT's non-proliferation provisions under Articles I, II and III. New Zealand continues to monitor developments in this area closely.
Mr Chairman
New Zealand places considerable importance on nuclear safety, in particular to strengthening international co-operation with respect to the transport of nuclear fuel and vitrified high-level waste. It is important that such shipments adhere to the highest possible safety and security practices, that timely information is provided and that an appropriate liability mechanism is in place.
Mr Chairman
New Zealand welcomes the positive engagement in recent years between shipping and coastal states on communication practices. My delegation hopes further tangible progress towards addressing and understanding concerns of
both coastal and shipping States can be made at future talks and that through this dialogue improved voluntary communication practices will result.
New Zealand is a strong supporter of the work undertaken by the International Experts Group on Nuclear Liability (INLEX), particularly in its examination of gaps in the nuclear liability regime. Having an effective liability regime in place to insure against harm to human health and the environment, as well as possible economic loss due to an accident or incident during the maritime transport of radioactive materials is a key priority for New Zealand.
Mr Chairman
These are some of the initial thoughts of my delegation on the issues grouped under this Cluster. We look forward to exploring some of these matters further during the interactive discussions you have planned under this heading.
Thank you Mr Chairman
