Mr. Chairman,
At the 1995 NPT Review Conference the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons agreed to strengthen the review process for the operation of the Treaty with a view to assuring that the purposes of the Preamble and the provisions of the Treaty are being realized. This agreement was reflected in the Decision 1 "Strengthening the Review Process for the Treaty" that stipulated the purpose of the Preparatory Committee meetings and established relevant organizational modalities.
In our view, the review process can be improved if in future States Parties to the NPT divide its work into two parts, namely:
-	review of the implementation of the Treaty; and
-	development of new measures to strengthen the NPT regime.
Within the review itself delegations could consider national reports presented in accordance with the respective NPT Review Conferences decisions. It would be efficient if the reports be circulated in advance in order to allow the States Parties to send questions, receive answers and be well prepared for common discussion at the meeting that at the end could make relevant conclusions or recommendations. Some organizational modalities for such review could be similar to the existing ones. e.g. within the Nuclear Safety Convention.
Based on those conclusions or recommendations the PrepCom could prepare relevant proposals, including on new measures to strengthen the NPT regime, for consideration at the Review Conference.
In order to facilitate this process we would suggest establishing a special office within the IAEA that would be responsible for preparatory and organizational modalities. In this case we could avoid financial difficulties since respective pledges could be included to the Regular Budget of the IAEA.
Mr, Chairman,
Since this proposal is considered by the Ukrainian delegation as "food-for-thought" we would appreciate views from other delegations regarding the improvement of the NPT review process.
Thank vou.
