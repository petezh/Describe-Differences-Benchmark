Chile wishes to reiterate that it reserves its inalienable right to benefit from all peaceful uses of nuclear energy and that, as a political and legal correlation, it faithfully abides by its obligations under Articles I, II and IU of the NPT. Chile has subscribed to the Additional Safeguards Protocol, which it considers.. to be the prevailing" safeguards^ standard, and: urges all- States Parties to do likewise without delay,
Chile wishes once more to draw attention to its call for progress towards the multilateral regulation of the maritime transport of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. Accordingly, it not only recognizes but also supports all the initiatives taken within the framework of the IAEA and IMO.
Our point of departure is that there is no "zero risk" in the nuclear industry, including in the maritime transport of nuclear material.
While recognizing the security measures that have been put in place by the States involved in such maritime transport - friendly States with which Chile maintains excellent relations - my country wishes to draw attention to the potentially disastrous effects ':hat an accident could have on the population, the maritime environment and the economy of coastal States, whose fishing industry is vital to their development. It should be pointed out that in this information age, the public's perception of the consequences of such accidents on their food security will have a much greater impact on their consumption habits than the scope - as scientifically measured - of the damage effectively caused.
We will therefore continue to work at the multilateral level and in friendly cooperation with the States involved in the maritime transport of nuclear material, for:
The full exchange of information on shipments of nuclear material, including contingency plans in case of accident; Formal recognition of the obligation to recover shipments lost as a result of accident; and
Full compensation for damage resulting from such accidents for: (a) the affected populations; (b) the environment; and (c) the economy of coastal States, including lost earnings.
Thank you very much.
