AT THE DEBATE UNDER CLUSTER 3 OF THE SECOND SESSION OF THE
PREPARATORY COMMITIEEE FOR THE 2015 REVIEW CONFERENCE TO THE
TREATY ON THE NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS
GENEVA, SWITZERLAND

Mr. Chairman ,
My delegation associates itself with the statement of the Non-Aligned Movement delivered
by Indonesia,
2,
Malaysia would like to reaffirm the inalienable right of all Slates Parties to develop,
research , produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, without discrimination,
as enshrined under Article IV of the Treaty, Malaysia reiterates that it is the right of state
parties to decide on and choose the fields of peaceful uses of nuclear energy including
their fuel cycle policies, Therefore, Malaysia firmly believes that no efforts or steps should
be taken by any parties that could be interpreted as affecting this right.
Mr. Chairman,
3,
As more and more developing countries are looking into the possibility of producing
nuclear energy as part of their energy mix, the role of the IAEA through its Technical
Cooperation Programme has become increasingly crucial. It is for this reason that
Malaysia, together with many other developing countries , has always taken a firm view
thai the IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme's resources should be sufficient, assured
and predictable in order to ensure that all planned programme can be implemented
effectively and efficiently, The final document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference
affirmed this principle,
Mr, Chairman,
4,
Malaysia, which has contributed to and also benefitted from the TC programmes,
has always supported the IAEA technical Cooperation programmes and we believe that
these programmes should continue to be formulated and implemented in accordance with
the IAEA's Statute and the agreed guiding principles as contained in INFCIRC/267, as
well as the decisions of the IAEA policy making organs,
5,
While Malaysia appreciates Peaceful Uses Initiative (PUI) aiming to provide extra
budgetary assistance to TC Programmes, Malaysia continues to believe that Technical
Cooperation Fund should be incorporated into the IAEA's regular budget. This is to enable
the IAEA to effectively plan and implement TC programmes for the benefits of member
states,

Mr. Chairman,
In conclusion, Malaysia would like to reiterate that the fundamental bargain of the
6.
State Parties to the NPT must be recognized and upheld. The Treaty, and the steps and
actions agreed upon by Review Conferences must be implemented equally in all its
aspects without favour or prejudice. As a multilateral legally-binding instrument, nothing in
the Treaty shall be compromised, including the very important aspect of the peaceful uses
of nuclear technology.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
