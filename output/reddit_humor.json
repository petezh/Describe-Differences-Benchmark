While they were walking through the barn, the farmer's mule suddenly reared up and kicked the mother-in-law, unfortunately killing her instantly. At the funeral service, the farmer stood near the casket and greeted folks as they walked by. The pastor noticed that whenever a woman would whisper something to the farmer, he would nod his head \"yes\" and say something. Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, he would shake his head \"no\" and mumble a reply.   Curious, the pastor later asked the farmer what that was all about. The farmer replied, \"The women would say, 'What a terrible tragedy,' and I would nod my head and say, 'Yes, it was.'

This is half of my paycheck.\" But he pays it anyways.  The plumber tells him, \"Hey, we are looking for more plumbers. You could become a plumber and triple your salary. Just make sure you say you only made it to 6th grade, they don't like educated people.\"  The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.  On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks John, \"What is the formula for the area of a circle?\"  John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation.

So naturally it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very difficult for the frog to make friends with the other frogs and he ends up with just one friend; a tortoise who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had the patience and the wherewithal to befriend this mute frog and to develop a system of communication with him. Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered a beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, \u00e2\u0080\u0098do you want me to take you to the pond?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does a great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making a lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond a beautiful girl frog. He can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring. The tortoise says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You like her, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The frog blinks once. The tortoise says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You want me to go talk to her for you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The frog blinks twice for No. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I see,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says the tortoise. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You wish you could talk to her yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The frog blinks once, a single tear rolling down his little frog cheek. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well gee, my friend,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says the tortoise. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been good friends for so long, I think I owe it to you to find a way to restore your voice.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And with that the tortoise sets out.The tortoise searches all over the forest for days until one day he meets a snake who just so happened to be the most renowned surgeon of all the land. This snake could perform any surgery that exists.  The tortoise explains the situation to the snake and asks him if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anything the snake can do for the frog.\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yessssss,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the snake replies. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There issss one sssurgery I can perform that may ressstore your friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099sss voice, but you have to undersssstand, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very risssky.

Do you want to go through with this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 After a long pause, the frog blinks once for Yes.

A Chinese Doctor can't find a job in a Hospital in the US, so he opens his own clinic and puts a sign outside 'GET TREATMENT FOR $20 - IF NOT CURED GET BACK $100.' An American lawyer thinks this is a great opportunity to earn $100 and goes to the clinic.Lawyer: \"I have lost my sense of taste.\" Chinese: \"Nurse, bring medicine from box No. 22 and put 3 drops in patient's mouth.\" Lawyer: \"Ugh. this is kerosene.\" Chinese: \"Congrats, your sense of taste is restored. Give me $20.\" The annoyed lawyer goes back after a few days to recover his money. Lawyer: \"I have lost my memory. I cannot remember anything.\" Chinese: \"Nurse, bring medicine from box no. 22 and put 3 drops in his mouth.\" Lawyer (annoyed): \"This is kerosene. You gave this to me last time for restoring my taste.\" Chinese: \"Congrats. You got your memory back. Give me $20.\" The fuming lawyer pays him, and then comes back a week later determined to get back $100. Lawyer: \"My eyesight has become very weak I can't see at all.\" Chinese: \"Well, I don't have any medicine for that, so take this $100.\" Lawyer (staring at the note): \"But this is $20, not $100!!\"Chinese: \"Congrats, your eyesight is restored.

Basically the frog blinks once for Yes, twice for No, the tortoise does all the talking and asks all the questions and they get along just fine. Years go by and the frog and the tortoise have fostered a beautiful friendship. But as the frog has gotten older he has become sexually curious and desires to mingle with the other frogs his age. The tortoise senses this one day and asks the frog, \u00e2\u0080\u0098do you want me to take you to the pond?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The frog blinks once for Yes. So the tortoise takes the frog to the pond and starts introducing him to all the other frogs. At first the frog is very nervous but the tortoise does a great job of explaining his disability and all the other frogs are very accepting of his condition. The mute frog ends up making a lot of new friends which boosts his confidence. And then the frog spies across the pond a beautiful girl frog. He can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take his eyes off of her and the tortoise catches him staring.

I could see she was not wearing a bra and her incredibly firm breasts were on show.      After watching her walk in I turned back to my beer. No sooner had I taken a sip when I turn to see her pulling another bar stool up close to me and sat down. She said 'Hi', and I said 'Hi' in return.

'In fact, I'll bet you've never felt this good before.''Well, I have,' I corrected her. 'You see, when I was 17, I was picked to play for the school 1st. XV in the National School Finals in front of a crowd of about 3000 and I felt really good.'I immediately felt a bit pathetic saying that and I thought she would get up and go.
