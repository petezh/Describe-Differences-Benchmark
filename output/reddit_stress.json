Do I send out this vibe asking for it from the universe? Then yesterday I decided to take my friend to go help another \"friend\" move to a new place. While we were driving the friend we are moving strikes me on my shoulder. And I address it immediately because this is the 4th time I have told him not to do these things, then my other friend who is driving nearly gets into an collision with another car i think because he was high on marijuana and the friend we are moving in the backseat is like \"you have to understand I was just trying to get your attention\" you know the thing 5 year olds do to get peoples attention by smacking them, this guy is in his 60's.", "Through work I have been in some dodgy situations abroad.

I used to be a very soft person, and I hope I'm still kind, but now I'm quicker to anger, and I don't want to become an abuser. Basically... was I abused? Does that sound like something an abused person would say? I feel like I have the symptoms of PTSD.", "I'm just blown away by this doctor's willingness to help. I feel so validated every time I leave his office, like someone actually understands what I'm struggling with, and I don't have to convince them of my mental illness. Bottom line? Research docs if you can online, read their reviews and don't give up until you find someone who treats you the way you deserve. If I can do this, I promise you can!", "She was seventeen and they met in a hospital, he was in the drug rehab, she was in the mental hospital. She was 17, and he technically kidnapped her, running across the country. She immediately got pregnant with me, and he married her, at which point the law washed their hands of the matter. I was born premature, 5 months and 3 weeks, which in 1981 was very dangerous.

Note: We are not doing anonymous interviews at this time, so your full name would be published in the story.", "Ive been leaving lights on at night both in the main rooms and my bedroom. The fear is both physical and emotional. Im so jumpy at work and at home. I feel like Im seeing things everywhere and little waves of panic wash through me all day. Im really just finding this incredibly difficult right now and needed to write it out I guess.", "All of these things I think contributed to this being a less traumatic experience than the first birth. Just before the second birth, she kind of lunged towards our first kid in the road, which, we later learned, gave her symphysis pubis dysfunction <url> She actually had substantial back/neck/joint pain (more on this later) in the first pregnancy as well, and this was worse, causing her to need crutches for the remainder of the pregnancy. This is not a super uncommon thing for a woman to experience <url> which includes my favorite-ever Wikipedia For [alternate related article], see...), but for most women, it resolves itself quickly after the baby is born. For my spouse, it didnt, and she started seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist. This maybe helped, maybe didnt.", "During the pregnancy and after the (traumatic) birth of our first child in 2013, symptoms started to intensify, including lots of depression, some manic behavior, and periodic angry outbursts. Somewhere in there we settled on a very (relatively speaking) effective combination of mental health meds that stabilized symptoms. We had our second child in 2015, after which an injury led to the discovery of a debilitating and incurable connective tissue disorder. The symptoms from this have been getting worse since then, and a good chunk of time from 2015 until now has been discovering whats going on, coming to grips with a new reality, and managing those symptoms. Overall weve had a very healthy supportive relationship with strong shared values.", "I have PTSD from my sexual abuse, and this week has been really hard. Really, since Dr. Ford came out against kavanaugh and the fallout of it. Today, though, was really hard. I come home to see my father watching fox news and agreeing that Dr. Ford is a lying whore. His words.", "And I don't ask for the nightmares to drain me of all energy and make me feel worse throughout the day the harder I try to be normal. I was planning on seeking counselling without my parent's knowledge for this condition once I get to university and get settled, but now I'm wondering if I'm going to be told the same thing by a therapist there. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just people who share my experience or know what I'm talking about. I'm sorry if this seems kind of ranty or rambling, my thoughts are a bit of a mess and I'm not sure what to think. Thank you for reading all this, anyhow.", "I kept my head up and demanded the respect I deserve. I was very polite and expect the same. She wasnt, so I put her in her place (she reprimanded me for leaving my gowns hung up in the dressing room). I came back to try on another gown and she goes you could at least bring them back. Mind you I have a one year old in my cart....", "I'm gonna try and get some sleep as it's the middle of the night here, and I hope I get through tomorrow with a single trigger, like I always wish for before I go to sleep. I hold that hope, and I know one day, it'll happen. Not now, but one day. Edit: Thank you all for your support and kind messages. It's really helped me get through today, and to keep moving forward, no matter how scary it seems, it's still moving forward.", "When I was a kid, I suffered a kind of unlikely injury that basically ruined me mentally, and it seems like I just CAN NOT get away from it, because it's such cheap gory shock value that everyone uses it when they need cheap gory shock value. And if I'm not mentally prepared to see it I have a panic attack or just start crying. A fucking jokey homebrew cursed item on r/DND did that to me today, and I hate that my trauma is so bad that I have to stay guarded even when I'm just reading a funny thread about my favorite hobby. I'm still thinking about that fucking item. I'm so tired.", "I dont know. Was this okay? Should I hate him? Or was it just something new? I really dont know what to make of the situation.", "i remember her getting drunk and and ranting about a fuck buddy she was angry at. she came up with the brilliant idea of throwing a brick with a pie recipe tied to it through his window (i dont know). she told me to drive her to his house so she could do that and i said i didn't think it was a good idea. she told me if i didn't do it she would drunk drive there with my little brothers in the car. i haven't seen her in 6 and a half years.", "Any help on how to stop ruminating? I work with some pretty toxic people and I can accept when people are ignorant and generally rude about my PTSD. I get it, some people are just really stupid and ignorant and won't understand how the assault affected me. But I spend WEEKS ruminating on all the things they've said, things they might say next... and the grounding techniques that my therapist suggests never stops it. How do you distract yourself from ruminating or arguing with people in your head?", "Trauma survivors often dont need more awareness. They need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them. At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being defective or not good enough. Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved. They live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right.", "Ok so firstly I should say she hasn't been formally diagnosed but it's at this point a logical conclusion that she's suffering some kind of ptsd from a rape that she endured a couple years back. It was before I knew her and when we met she seemed to be pretty stable. Although I know now that's not the case. I do not blame her at all for this behaviour but I really need help understanding her before I get hurt worse than I already have. Going forward keep in mind 2 things:", "My therapist says this is a normal behavior to display. Having been ripped from my children and left on the streets is very hard and i honeslty want to give up. But the anxiety swirls to the point i keep trying to find where i went wrong. It replays and plays in my head over and over like a horror movie. The feeling of wanting to die because at that point i had nothing left.", "Thanks to my alma mater !      Id like to know Any suggestions from u all on how I might I move on in the  healthiest way possible and carry on with only love in my heart for her? How might I bounce back and focus on forming healthier relationships? Any advice or suggestions are appreciated, guys. Sending positive vibes your way ", "I know there are a lot of bad stories on here about therapy. But I was wondering about good experiences. My own experience was six weeks ago. I slipped and went on s bender, I fell into a depressive, suicidal crisis. I phoned every crisis line that exists, for ten hours, well getting drunker and drunker.", "I barely slept in the hospital because I stayed up at night and listened for codes with his room number. I was terrified, constantly living in fear from the moment I awoke until about his 7th day in the hospital when he seemed clearer, and sat up with assistance for the first time. Fast forward to now. We are lucky to be alive, and we are injured. Weve been robbed of a normal engagement, of the experience of moving in together, and thats a grieving process...but my mind...is not what it was.", "These things seem dumb and I swear to God I didn't think they'd work, but a therapist I had told me about them and they actually do work. To stop a feeling of rage: Stand straight with your feet apart. Raise your arms as high as you can above your head, and put your hands together (like people do when they're praying). Stretch as high as you can. Jump and land on the floor, bringing your hands down between your legs, and hold that position for a few seconds.", "Strangely enough, I had buried all this. But when my parents also failed to realise that my sister was on meth and neglecting her children, who are very dear to me, it sort of doubled the trauma and now I have full blown trauma. I feel like my parents just aren't trustworthy. How can they live in such an oblivious bubble? I wouldn't put any faith in them to protect me now and feel that I'm in this world on my own.", "Again, most of the time I can just say 'ah, screw 'em they're not a doctor' but you know how it goes when you're having an episode. Phew, ok! Sorry for such a long post, I just usually like long reads on Reddit so I figure it's ok. Feel free to share your experiences with feeling \"fake!\" It's good to not feel alone. TL;DR I sometimes feel like I'm faking having PTSD despite never expecting I had it and then getting an official diagnosis from a doctor.", "I feel like I'm starting to get the control back over my life slowly. I'm resignating to my situation and I'm ready to make things better for myself. I have stable relationship with my very supportive wife, my ambitions are growing back slowly... I finnaly have hope and I could hardly ask for more. I asked my doc to lower my Effexor because I feel like the the side-effects outweigh the good it does: It doesn't really help much for my anxiety, I feel depersonalization ever since I'm on medications and finally it gives me uncontrollable cravings.", "I feel like I'm going to go insane. I can't stop crying or wanting to pull my hair out or screaming. I can't stop shaking. I'm on medications for anxiety and they help some but not much and not often... Ultimately, I know I'm not me anymore.", "I did. I moved 1300 miles away. Im in therapy (just started again). Financially I dont have any worries at the moment. Im moving to a bigger place ..", "My current boyfriend wasn't right, just a figure of the coma induced illusion. The only voice that seemed remotely really was my best friend, she's one of the few regular poodle I still have contact from that time. After a hour of my boyfriend, my best friend and my other partner working with me, I slowly started coming to some balanced sembelrnce of reality. Now I'm scared to go back to sleep. My ex, who abused me for 11 years, might be waiting tight there for me again.", "I know what it means to dive into oneself. I asked him and he confirmed its a deeper variant. I got excited. Theres no switching out of consciousness, you can reject what he says, your totally in control (or so hes telling me :)). So the first part was getting me deep, through counting, dropping my hand and other techniques I went deep.", "I wonder what I would be like if I had gotten help earlier on. **Here's where I could use some input: I don't consider myself mentally ill. I hate the word. If someone asked me if I was, I'd deny it but I know I have PTSD and I guess that does make me ill by definition. Will I be considered mentally ill forever?", "One of the couples has a four-year-old daughter. We live in a two bedroom apartment. I constantly have to do shit for these people. One of the wives scolds me  constantly and tells me I need to show more respect for my parents. They leave needles out everywhere and when I inevitably step on one I'll probably end up with an STD.", "I hate the thought that even after my mom's death she still has power over me. Anyways, I've come here for advice on meds, specifically if this sounds like a good place to start. I used to just focus on the anxiety and insomnia acutely but never really tried to treat the source. I'm starting Effexor XR, Prazosin for the horrendous nightmares and continuing on clonazepam for panic attacks. Thanks guys!", "Sure it was almost 3 years ago (in July) two months into my first job out of university. I got bit in the leg and continued on like it was nothing. I only fell apart October 2016. I must have been living in survival mode until I got the call that the man who saved my life was getting recognized with a bravery award. Hearing those words, I literally felt my chest rip open and haven't been able to close the wound since.", "What is for you the most relatable portrayal you have seen/heard I don't have PTSD but reading a retired Marines blog I noticed that when he was talking about his PTSD it sounded a lot like Rick in the Walking Dead. Ill explain for those who have never seen it. Rick was the leader of his group during a zombie outbreak. He killed his best friend twice (technically) and his wife died along with most everyone he knew.", "I'm fine, or so I thought. All my issues with anger, alcohol abuse, frequent bouts of depression, difficulties focusing or concentrating at work, I attributed to my bipolar disorder, and that was all I worked on. I've tried so many different types of medications and combinations thereof, more than 10 for sure, and even underwent electro-convulsive therapy, but nothing helped. It was not until this past summer that I thought to try therapy, something I had actively avoided. I didn't think that talking about anything would affect my bipolar disorder, and I **really** didn't want to talk about my trauma.", "I do not know if I ought to, to be honest. I determined to quit drinking nine months ago, and have been sober seven weeks. But I never had any desire to quit grass, and I still don't. But I am in trauma therapy for the last four months, and my therapist has brought it up a number of times. She keeps saying it affects my motivation and depression, but it helps with bot the GAD and social anxiety.", "I want to be able to deal with these feelings and move on. Ive talked briefly to a counsellor on the phone but besides talking about it making me cry, it hasnt made me feel better. This is one of the worst PTSD episodes of my life. I cant predict how long this is going to go on and Im sick of the weak, dissolving feeling I get whenever I think about it. Ive been trying to replace bad thoughts with good, Ive tried CBT techniques, Ive tried wallowing in the bad thoughts (as advised by someone over at r/emetophobia)... nothing has worked, Im a mess.", "I waited a bit and then went and talked to our advisor. I vaguely and briefly explained what happened so I could get his help in understanding some procedures I didn't understand. We went down to the lab and figured out my work together. I was then standing and doing something with my samples while my advisor was doing something else in the room. Then I suddenly looked up toward the door and entirely expected my fellow student to burst in yelling about how I told our advisor.", "Every day I wake up doing nothing. Absolutely nothing except wasting my life, hoping something would happen but of course nothing would happen because I am a lonely fuck who pushes away everyone in his life while everyone else goes out and party like there is no tomorrow and fuck and cum like they are in a porno and make memories that not even one memory book is enough. Every day I wake up doing nothing. Either wasting my time playing videogames or watching the social media status scrolling up and up and up when in reality, i am doing absolutely nothing. Nothing is being absorbed in that stupid brain of mine, wherever the hell it is when I should be doing something more productive like studying or reading but either my own brain rotted to the size of a pea *(because of how mental disorders degenerate brain cells ... yay me, I am doing something at all)* or it just felt and flew up to Mars, or it is sitting its dark throne,  rubbing its pitchfork,  planning its next move on how to fuck me, both literally and figuratively.", "People may quickly think \"drugs\" but just try and quickly think \"animals\" unless you are dangerous when you have your episodes or become angry after them. Just think that all of that drug money some people spend could go on raising and giving a loving home to an animal who will heal him/her. x &#x200B; &#x200B;", "All these sexual abuse accusations, while wonderful to see so many men and women coming forward about sexual abuse, I just can't escape it. So much victim blaming, the increasingly clear proof that many men do not actually understand what consent means, it's just too much. I haven't left the apartment in days and the only reliable form of self medication is too expensive (weed). I'm also autistic so I've noticed it's also overstimulating me to the point I'm hiding. It's just too much and I thank you for reading my vent.", "When I try to befriend artists or thinkers or doers. They often either shun me because my work has been sub par and nearly non existant and they don't see me as equal. Or they show sexual/romantic interest I don't reciprocate which makes me nervous and avoidant. Sometimes I am shunmed I think because they mistake my interest in making friends for a romantic interest. I am quite annoyed by all the assumptions/game playing/projecting that goes on in the world.", "I'm pretty broke and almost all of my money for now is going towards bills and food. I have my state's basic free insurance OHP (Oregon Health Plan) but I'm not sure what kind of psychological services they could provide. I'm hesitant to start a regimen of anxiety medications if it's possible to work through things. Open to any advice. Thank you very much in advance.", "But I still froze and cried through the entire thing. Some of the sensations brouvht me to memories of old sensations, andI felt really vulnerable, trapped, and ashamed, and I haven't been able to shake it off all day. Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family. Additionally, because it's my boyfriend's family, my boyfriend has been unavailable to me all day.", "Previously, I have posted on this subreddit about how studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects turmeric can have on PTSD symptoms. See <url>  and <url>  . &#x200B; However, too much of a good thing can turn sour. When taking anything natural in supplemental doses that exceed what is found in the diet, we should treat them as drugs.", "I have therapy sessions scheduled but at the moment, I'm currently looking for some advice and insights. The only time I feel 'comfortable in my own skin' is when I'm drunk and or stoned. I, in the past have been ridiculed for an effeminate walk, been erroneously suspected of being gay and I have an effate look. Perhaps this facial look is a projection of my despair and a subconscious psychosomatic cry for help. I'm in my late twenties and have yet to accomplish anything of significance.", "I've been through treatment and had a period of relative health for a stretch. Then I had a bunch of new trauma experiences. I'm 5 or so years out from the last experiences and have moved 800 miles away, completely cut off from all former contacts with the exception of one close friend. The move helped for a while, then it hit with vengeance. Panic attacks, ruminating, depression, anger, the whole deal.", "The silent sadness that you feel for no apparent reason yet somehow you feel too weak or too much of a pussy to do anything about it or even think that you deserve better because you feel like you deserve whatever painful feeling you are going through You feel like you rather suffer a long and painful life rather than ending your life because you feel like you deserve whatever agony you are going through The anxiety and panic attack come and go whenever they please. __________________________________________________________ Sometimes it feels like you somehow been hit by an invisible truck and your body is as frozen as it somebody turned you into a popsicle and you have no other choice but shake from the inside.", "As I recover, I am in a great deal of conflict. I am scared to remember that year. I am frightened of what might be there. And I feel guilty for not remembering that year, too. I go way down the rabbithole, sometimes, wondering if I am crazy and nothing happened and my ex was right, because there are so many things I can't remember, now.", "If I pursue this research, would you be interested in participating? How much time would you be willing to give (asking because a survey might take up to 30minutes, but an interview can take up to 2 hours)? Would you prefer to be surveyed or interviewed (it would likely be a phone interview)? If I did a survey, it would probably still include some open-ended questions (that you are free to leave a few sentences of a few page worth of a response to) so I can still hear directly from you. Feel free to answer these questions in the comments, or dm me.", "German Shepards, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and Poodles all seem like a good choice. Poodle would be good for allergies as many of my close family have allergies. Shepadoodles, Labradoodles, and Golden Doodles might also make a good choice if they were from bloodlines that had proven to be hypoallergenic. I've trained a therapy dog in the past who was a labradoodle. Lovely dog.", "Anyway, I feel like maybe I should talk to someone, but I have no idea how to even bring it up with my doctor. How does that work? Do I just march in and say \"Hey Dr, I think maybe I have PTSD.\"? Just sounds weird. EDIT: Also want to throw in here that I'm not interested in being medicated", "Asked for a little extension. She wont provide it. I should be able to graduate in December. My academic counselor is looking to help me graduate around some of the program, so I hate to bring my concerns up higher or file with disability. My trauma therapist wants me to advocate higher up.", "Well I guess it was my second. Last week we set the ground work for the safe space to come back to if things got too overwhelming. This week we began to work through my trauma. Starting out the session was definitely very strange. I wasnt sure what answers my therapist was looking for but once she assured me that there were no wrong answers everything went fine.", "My girlfriend does have PTSD. She said that she thought that I might have it because of an incident that occurred in 2014. You can read about it in my post history but basically I was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for pretty much no reason, the therapists responsible for it just covered themselves up and lied about it. It greatly affected me. I would definitely consider it to be a traumatic event, not just because of the actual events that transpired and the conditions of the hospital (which are pretty bad) but also just the huge betrayal of trust.", "I'm sure as other survivors many of you are overcoming some of the same problems as well, and may have already had some of these realizations (of what makes you YOU) or are in search of them on your journey to becoming whole. It is crazy how DEEP these emotional scars and wounds are, that I literally cried way harder in this session, than in even processing waking up in a hospital bald! In this memory, I had post-partum depression right after my son was born and was living with Nmom and my Edad when they were still married 8 years ago. (I'm so grateful that they are no longer married. He is such an excellent parent/person NOW that he doesn't care about \"undermining her\".)", "Does anyone have any advice? I feel pretty hopeless right now. I want desperately to be with my partner, and I suspect even if our relationship ends I will always love and care for him very much. I don't want to spend my life wishing I was with him, but be too overcome with my anxiety and fear to do so. It is discouraging to feel as though my ex-boyfriend is still inside my head and controlling my life.", "then i tried an ep of bojack horseman on my tablet, but it didnt really help. for ex, after it was over, i still had my tablet on for light and i was staring up at the ceiling when the ceiling and the wall behind me started to ripple weirdly, distorting, and then the tablet light went off abruptly and i startled and yelped and quickly turned it back on! i also felt someone sit on my bed next to me when i tried to leave the light off and sleep. i distinctly felt it. i didn't hear distant voices like the other time i was this 'hypervigilant,' but i heard some small noise rustle in the closet (just a house noise i assume) and it unnerved me.", "I'm overwhelmed looking at all the options on amazon.

I saw spire but they have so many one star reviews from customers whose device stopped working for one reason or another. I'm looking for something that's more reliable.", "I just felt it was best to separate them for the time, at least until he hopefully calmed down. I had asked someone else in the group--without informing them of what had transpired--to direct the male back to the cars so we could leave. But the male had run off. So while everyone else went back to a mutual friend's house, I drove around looking for him.

It's also not something I was ready to take on because... Damn... So many people have it worse than I do.", "Oh, I forgot Aversives. This is where the therapist is openly punitive, hostile or withholding, explicitly, in order to punish and teach you.

There is also telephone contact.", "I go to the VA and I see people who need it more than me. I make a good living and only want to get on with life.

I didn't trust I'd know how he'd react if I did or said anything...He wasn't the gentle and respectful person I thought he was. I left after the shower but when I got home, I broke down.", "Kinda interesting how even when Im not feeling awful, tiredness still makes me ruminate and feel angry. Hm. I wonder if its the biological sleepiness or if its kinda a pavlovian response because Im so used to having terrible feelings when I sleep? Probably kinda both. Anyway, how are you all doing?", "First and foremost, I am not a veteran. I found out about PTSD service dogs from my good friend who also suffers from PTSD and is in the process of training her pup to be a service dog. I have found some helpful resources online giving information about service dogs for PTSD, but most of them seem to be geared toward either: therapy dogs or PTSD dogs only for veterans. <url> \u00a1\u00ef are all trainings this expensive? <url> \u00a1\u00ef awesome article, but this website is also for veterans", "Because i feel like nothing i do isn't even worthy of being considered a success. Because the carpet is cover in pee from animals and reminds me of my mothers house. How i used to go to school every morning covered in cat and dog urine. Every little bit of confrontation feels like world war 3 in my head. Every little feels like it gets put on me as blame and i cant deal.", "I haven't posted here yet, but as everyone here has probably experienced, PTSD is one of the most isolating conditions. Even as an adult surrounded by other adults at school, I feel so isolated. It's really disappointing that other students in my class can't seem to grasp the concept of PTSD in people who aren't veterans. There is a fundamental lack of understanding that has resulted in further alienation. For some reason, dissociations in sufferers who are not former military is unacceptable.", "Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out. I just have to live with all the horror and memories and I hate it. Tl;dr I hate myself and the life I led. I'm ashamed I didn't figure out that things could be different sooner.", "I've never done this before but we always stay at my house, so maybe the odds are just greater here? After she told me about it in the morning I feel like pure shit. She said my eyes were open and I don't know if she believes it was accidental... How can I manage this situation? That's all I really need to know, I don't know what to do.", "Im coming to find that my family are rapist sympathizers given the right circumstance (ie. sports). How would you want the media to change? What would make it easier to watch the news while also covering newsworthy topics? My head is in a fog still so hopefully that all made sense.", "Im just wondering how many of you have A LOT of triggers? I was abused extremely horribly as a teenager and into adulthood and I have horrible ptsd from it. I literally get triggered by everything and anything. Like someone could sneeze and it would sound similar to him and Id freak. I freak out horribly about everything and the littlest things.", "It started again, but worse. I'd bring up the conversation we had and he'd ask how dare I call him names. How dare I, he said. So, on September 7th, I decided that I had enough.

I just wanted to ask them to stop saying it.", "I'm too unstable. Telling parents is not an option. I'm not going to give the easy redemption for them. All this is still suspicion. I know I'm no professional, but I'm telling you, I'll get help.", "The place where I was going for therapy decided that they couldn't appropriately treat me. I've had a tough time finding another therapist. The strange thing is I've been feeling better out of therapy then when I was in it. I was doing a type of exposure therapy and it was rough. I went twice a week and it felt like my whole life revolved around trauma.", "So I'm feeling a bit lost with this. I've had asthma ever since I was a little kid and it has been flaring up really bad over the last few weeks... I think. Actually I'm not sure if that's what it really is. I recently got a prescription for trazodone (about six weeks ago), and it has helped with having fewer nightmares.", "My ex thought that show was terrific inspiration. He used it to discuss what ifs with his guy friends, who I hope had no idea how real he is about that shit. I called it The Rape Along/Beat Along Show for the longest time.

I feel so hopeless. How am I supposed to feel safe? Or be able to sleep? Hes out there, consequence free, feeling safe enough to message her.", "So I have ptsd from an abusive relationship I ended about 3 years ago. When I felt healthy enough I went to therapy and did emdr and it helped and I thought i was doing well. I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night. I have started dating a guy I'm pretty smitten about and last night we went out with friends and had a really good time but we also had been drinking. Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.", "two months off of work in my favorite city with limitless money and i am more infuriated than ever. all its done is remove my dissociation and now i have inexplicable rage. i just fucking hate everything. i hate this site, even, and made an ultimatum never to come back. but i have no fucking idea what even to do.", "But now, my cognitive processes feel so scrambled up and sluggish. I get so confused sometimes I have trouble filling out simple forms or answering questions on the phone. I'm in my 3rd year at a major university but my brain feels so messed up I don't know if I'll be able to finish. Does anyone else experience this? Have you found anything that helps?", "Can anyone relate to this feeling? I cant enjoy myself at things like concerts anymore. Im not fully present because I have to try so hard to curb feelings of anxiety and hyper-vigilance. When anyone gets too close to me or accidentally touches me I freak out. Tonight I went to a concert and I was so self-conscious and distracted by the fear that I was going to be assaulted that it was difficult to focus on the actual show.", "A few years ago I witnessed an accident at this time of year and I am beginning to remember it again. At night I hear the sound and burst into tears and calm down until I hear it again and start crying. I didnt know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but Im beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it. I feel guilty for this indulgence and feel like maybe I am just looking for attention. I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?", "Especially the power of healing brought upon by service animals. I too, have a service dog named Luna. This wonderful man was nice enough to bring the book back in while I was off yesterday with a note with his name and number telling me to call him when I finish the book.

Theres so much negativity in the world today and it seems not many people will stop to do something nice for someone, or help them by doing a random act of kindness.", "So I've basically got a plan: hoard all my drugs until Tuesday, OD that night with a combo of slit wrists and maybe even hanging. I want it to be damn efficient, because this is trial number 13. These are the thoughts I've been having lately. My last attempt was at a hospital, just a few days ago, but I lied and told them it was my anxiety that led me to self-harm. They discharged me.", "I never thought Id be in a situation like that in my life and the screaming and blood and chaos following it is just on a constant repeat in my head that wont stop. I had to give 4 separate statements to the police which burned it from start to finish in my brain and it doesnt stop. I dont know if thats just because it was less than 24 hours ago and Im still just in shock? Its just a lot to take in right now  and Im not sure what to do. I apologize for any formatting issues because Im on mobile/ sounding incoherent Im just kind of numb after all this and unsure what to do.", "Ugh. I just need to tell people who I know will understand what happened. If you can relate, offer support, anything... that would be appreciated.

I chose weed mostly because I was pissed they drug tested me for one but also weed seems to do the best for me. Now im regretting that decision. I guess I need a new pcp huh?

I'm just tired.", "And everyone was passive aggressive. The manager tried to peg down my salary multiple times like a fucking haggler at a market. Anyway, I decided to go get some antidepressants and the bottle fell out of my pocket, a coworker noticed and reported it to my boss. Who smiled and asked if there was anything I'd like to tell her. The passive aggressive shit really got to me, and then I realized that I was being illegally paid.", "The following week, my mom let me use her car to drive my brother to another city for an appointment. The car is going to be mine when she buys herself a new one, so I was really excited about driving it around more often. Everything was fine until I got to the actual city and then a woman drove through a red light and hit my mom's car. I held myself together because my younger brother was with me and he has his own depression to deal with, he didn't need to see his sister break down. The car was still driveable, so I dropped him off and his appointment and then had my meltdown in the drivers seat while explaining everything to my mom.", "Kyle got out and started contacting me again, writing letters to prove he still knew where I lived, and being able to get in touch with me regardless of me blocking him. I have some friends in the police force near me, who I informed of the situation. About the same time I started talking to them, Kyle was put in jail for separate reasons. Since these two events, he has stopped contacting me (thank Christ.) James knows about Kyle, but I havent told James about the most recent developments because he has had a lot going on (a death in the family, health issues, among others).", "I have trouble connecting to it on a personal level, but isn't that healthy separation of past/present? I think my present anxieties/self image issues stem from traumatic experiences, but I can talk about these things fairly openly in a way that feels rehearsed. I had a panic attack where I felt terrified and unable to move at my psych's this past Tuesday, but that's not typical for me, at least not anymore? I realized most my recent \"panic attacks\" may be \"breakdowns\" because it's not accompanied by a sense of fear, but pent up emotions I haven't been able to release resulting in a sudden loss of control... I start hyperventilating, screaming, and unleash all this pent up fury to the point where I feel detached from my emotions/self and have no control, start throwing things or hurting myself, until I'm exhausted and suddenly shut down/dissociate.", "I sometimes call it \"fight mode\". Extensive martial arts background has turned negative adrenalized states from inward, depressive vulnerability to external, physical reactivity. I describe it as feeling like I'm in a fight (physiologically) though I am sitting still or trying to sleep. Loss of fine motor skills, hypervigilance, scanning all surroundings and people as if they are about to hit me and I have to hit back. I could be stretching, but I feel like this \"fight\" response as opposed to my old \"flight\" or \"freeze\" response has effected even the emotional aspects of my attacks.", "For me, that doesn't HELP AT ALL. It just makes me feel like I'm just pissing him off, and my problem has suddenly become his, minimizing my emotions about it? (I hope that makes sense). He always says I need to be protected, but he doesn't understand that it's not an imminent threat in my life anymore, but a constant struggle and disability; that my brain works and processes things differently now and always will. I just feel so very alone when I talk to him.", "i never really knew people gave a shit about me, and it really meant a lot to me; it still does. but if so many people are here for me, and things are going to be okay, why am i still afraid of them? why do i still have a pit in my stomach and why are these thoughts still clawing at the sides of my skull? why am i crying right now? i don't understand it, i don't understand my own brain and i feel like an ungrateful prick for still being shaken up so badly.", "Does anyone else feel the same way? I am just too numb and burned out. I can love people but I can't fall in love with them. I can't give them what they need, the regular sex or the emotional intimacy, and I just end up feeling guilty. I can get along with them just fine, I can respect them and consider their feelings, but that's not enough.", "This 100% stems from the abuse from my ex, and him training me to always be home. It home, go in my bed and lay there and watch some TV show or another while I'm on my phone. I get out of bed around 7:30ish and cook dinner. I eat dinner, then lay back in my bed until I decide to go to bed. Usually around 10pm.", "My problem is, if I'm going to date anyone, they have to be aware that I struggle with PTSD and willing to at least be there for me when I need. I don't need coddling or protecting, I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out, or help me through a flashback. I need someone who can *be* present and emotional, and someone I can feel comfortable having a conversation with about it.

He talks about what he'd do to my abusers if he ever found them.", "I assumed she would answer the question, or she would explore my feelings of inadequacy, or she would interpret the transference. But her response instead was the title \"I am not getting into this with you\". She then went on with how she did like me, thought I was an interesting and nice person. but I do not believe that, it is too unlikely. Besides, as an addendum to her refusal to speak to my question, it seemed false.", "Saturday, September 29 is the Bay Area premiere of WRESTLING GHOSTS, an excellent new documentary that follows Kim, a young mother, as she does the work to heal from her difficult childhood. I saw the film this week at the L.A. Film Festival. It's the first film I know of to show what healing actually looks like, the long, slow, difficult, rewarding journey.

You see her change and grow.", "I wound up in partial hospitalization and diagnosed with PTSD related to several traumas including sexual assault I experienced as a child.

I thought about going to HR about it, but I'm in a position where I can't jeopardize this job, and I'm not the most well-liked person on the team (nothing that I did, I was hired externally for a position that 3 internals wanted), for whatever that's worth.

And now I'm back here, a delicate PTSD flower.", "Its really kind of ruining my ability to empathize with some people Bc of comments theyve made in the past. I witnessed the attempted suicide of my sister and then subsequent self harm targeting just towards myself for the purpose of manipulation and dealt with no one believing that it happened. So many people have told me be happy it was a failed attempt, failing to recognize the damage knowing someone I love could want to hurt me so badly did. Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that. Trauma shouldnt be a competition.", "And then I just want it to go away. I dont know what to do about this, I feel like the world doesn't want me to talk about it. It's to uncomfortable for people...

Update: I should probably add that I was terrified of my mom and never tried to provoke her. I never snuck out, never got in trouble at school, no drugs, no drinking, no bad friends, tried to keep my grades up as best as I had time for, and never ever back talked; even though I dreamt of serving it to her one day.

She has always been very sensitive to how people are feeling and acting (when I have an episode with my celiac disease she will curl up by my stomach and won't leave my side) could this be  a starting point for me to train her to recognise when I have a major panic attack and just lay with me until it passes?

I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again. My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I dont tell people why Im in this situation because it scares people.

Her response was that a lot of people have fd up things they have to deal with but they still have to do stuff.", "There is a waitlist to be called when they become available.

My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it.

It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either. The neuropsychologist I saw offered me books to read to learn more about my condition but did not give any other treatment options because the cause of my disorder was unknown.

I genuinely enjoy having sex, but I would like to know ways to lessen my trauma symptoms and stay present during it.", "I realize that why Im ok is because I am now  past the acute phase of ptsd that I developed last year.

I cant expand it.", "Now my treatment has stopped this triggering from happening and sometimes think about moving back. If I do I will occasionally see places and buildings connected to bad memories.

I understand. When my grandma was dying of Cancer, she kept forcing my grandma to undergo procedures and more chemo because she didn't want to lose her mother. Nevermind that wasn't my grandma's wishes and a slow all of her siblings were getting to the point of not wanting to subjected her to further treatments and just let her go, but not my mom.

I got pregnant again, after he forcibly took my birth control away, my 2nd son was born in Chile, I didn't realize once I had my child in Chile I couldn't leave with my son without the father's permission. I think that was part of his plan. I lived 4 years of brutal hell.

I know part of the problem may be how much I've repressed and can't feel, but... I don't know, I feel I've exaggerated so much.

About 5 years ago I started feeling small signs of PTSD but just brushed it off like it wasnt a real thing until it just kept getting worse and eating away at me, until I realized enough is enough. I thought maybe I have PTSD but then I would contradict myself and say that its not real and I dont have it which would make me feel worse. Im finally getting help and yesterday for the first time in 15 years I have officially by a doctor been diagnosed with PTSD, its weird to say this but for the first time ever I felt a sigh of relief like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.", "Summa summarum: I got attacked by two guys, without any provcation.

Totally in love, but here's the thing: in love with the idea of him I had created, from interviews and blog posts and the music itself. It was deeper than a crush, I know that. Then came whispers that he had a girlfriend. He had stopped whining about being single on Twitter and seemed happier.", "Someone elses suffering ensued. I feel immense sadness and guilt now.

Anyway, so we were roommates in a super tiny apartment that didnt even have a living room, just our two bedrooms divided by a kitchen. He was having some issues with his ex-girlfriend so he was venting to me for hours about it, and I was trying to give him as much advice as I could, because hes my friend and I care about him.

At the time I didnt understand trauma or realize how deep her problems were (since I hadnt seen them much), but I always listened to her first and foremost. We paid out of pocket for a home birth with a backup hospital plan at her parents house. The birth was precipitous (very fast, only a few hours) and extremely traumatic and painful.

He didnt know what happened, and when he asked me what was wrong I just started to cry. I felt stupid and ashamed.

I told her that it wasnt a waste of my time and that I'm here because I want to get better. This was only my second time meeting her and we never delved into any of the main issues that I was facing but she brushed me off so quickly all because I wasn't sobbing my eyes out or felf like committing suicide.

They represent polar opposites on the spectrum of how cancer survivors can view the world:  one feeling positive about having survived so much, the other being angry with the world that it happened in the first place.

I'll never forget her saying \"No, you definitely have PTSD,\" and in that moment I experienced more validation of my suffering then I had in my entire life.

When I'm around other people I feel even even more anxious/fearful. I know nothing bad is going to happen to me, but I still feel this way.

Not how we were brought up. We're waiting for me and her to finish college so we can get out of here and move to a civilized nation elsewhere.", "It sorta works, but I don't like the feeling of being deadheaded. I also don't have a good relationships with doctors considering I was misdiagnosed with bipolar as a teen and given lithium... Had a terrible reaction to it. What are some more natural remedies or self-help you all do to keep yourself in the proper mindset to calm your triggers? I've started meditation and taking CBD oil (which work great, but kinda expensive), but it doesn't seem to be enough. I just want to start living and be able to enjoy life.", "Deep breathing, reminding myself that I'm just irrationally panicking, promising myself to take it step by step, analyzing the emotional baggage I've placed on this paper. For weeks now, it's been sitting on my computer, mocking me. It's late, and I'm slowly loosing motivation to even try. Can anyone help? I really want to try and edit the paper into something worth reading without feeling like I can't breathe.", "So I have been suffering from chronic anxiety for eight years.The kind where you feel some enemy is breathing down on your neck always.I don't want to get into the details of this matter because it's is very personal. But from the beginning of this anxiety my breathing got messed up. Like I was alternating my breathing between hyperventilation and shallow breathing through out the day for all these years. During these last five years I have suffered bone TB, now stomach gastritis for three years,also found out I have recurring kidney stones in my left kidney.Before all this begun I was relatively healthy without any complicated disease like  bone tb or stomach gastritis. So it seems to me this long chronic anxiety and the resulting hyperventilation and shallow breathing and high blood pressure did make my immune system rather weak or damaged.", "And I'll get an intense feeling of impending doom. It lasts for less than a minute and then I'll fall back asleep. It usually happens during naps. I thought it was a seizure when it first happened. Has this happened to anyone else?", "Nothing major, some underage drinking, a little pot, but I wasn't a bad kid. Furthermore, I feel like I matured well and have gone on to be successful for my age (24) IMO. I've also had positive experiences with police. The resource officer at my high school was a really good guy and almost like a mentor to me. When I was 17 I was arrested when police raided a friends house because they were tipped off that there was to be some under-aged drinking.", "Etc etc etc. \". My brain takes this one little choice -should I go back in the water- and blows it up so big that I spend 20 minutes trying to figure out what I should do, and I end up frozen unable to make ANY decision. Does this happen to anyone else? How do you deal with this?", "So Ive been taking 40mg paroxetine for around 3 months (I dont go to her straight away) and have been fine until the past two weeks. Im beginning to notice that my anxiety is again incredibly high a lot of the time. By listening to my body Ive come to realise that caffeine is triggering me. NOW this is new. Ive been drinking coffee since I was around 17 (22 now) and Ive never had an issue (infact, it used to put me to sleep) but now whenever I have a coffee (French press at home or latte from a barista) within about 30 minutes I begin to shake and uncontrollably sweat.", "I won't go into too much detail but what stems off of that is thoughts of being and feeling worthless like I'm not good enough for anyone and that I'm undeserving of the good things given to me but then another thought stems off of that one which would be something along the lines of me thinking how stupid I was acting and then another thought after that and so on. Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much). Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. Other than that though I'm quite optimistic and I tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person! I'm seeing someone about these problems but I just thought I'd ask if anyone has any extra advice they could give if things start to get a bit out of control.", "I hope I can remember that my anxiety was misguided and ultimately wrong. And more than that, I hope that whoever reads this (if anyone does) can remember it too.

Im determind not to be as agoraphobic as i was i will not be stuck inside trapped by myself.

I know i should eat, but the anxiety part of me keeps trying to convince me i dont need to eat i'll be ok if i just stay inside safe.", "I dont know what to do to be liked again, i guess it would be different if she had hated me from the beginning but that just isnt the case. She also hates my boyfriend and doesnt allow him anywhere near her house. I cant move because the rent is only $500 and I cant afford anything else, and yes, I do have a job. I've even asked her why she thinks I'm so stupid and she said \"because nobody taught you these things\" so I guess shes helping, it's just hard to know that I'm a failure. I try to meditate and to think very very very deep before I say anything, like to try and think of every outcome and if it might make her hate me more then I shouldnt say it.", "I don't know. Pretty sure. But my nose is stuffy from this stupid cold so it'd make sense that I'm having a hard time breathing from it. But I'm also having a hard time breathing through my mouth. I can't find my vapor rub anywhere, which is annoying the crap out of me because I feel like it'd help a little (the mintiness from brushing my teeth helped a tiny bit).", "For the past couple months I have had really bad soreness and tightness in my upper back and neck. Sometimes it gets so stiff I can barely move my head. At first i thought it was a physical injury so I went to the doctors and had an xray but they could not find anything. I notice it flares up when im anxious. I have tried many self massages, creams, baths, pads, you name it.", "one day i broke down into absolute tears and was rushed into the counselers office. at this point im in 8th grade and this is by no means acceptable behavior. we are about to go into high school and i just burst into a ball of tears in front of every last one of my peers. the good thing is, this scenario made me care a little less about what everyone thought of me due to the already absolute embarrassment of myself. My mindset, the people i surrounded myself with, and my family life were all fucked to say the least... especially family.", "If its the wrong place for this feel free too delete,  it would be on par with the rest of the day. Edit:  thank you,  too those who've responded and any others who might. I always expect to get turned away whenever i ask for help,  especially when i read how others are suffering. It always makes my problems seem not worth anyone's time. So thank you,  it means a lot to me.", "Anxiety kicked in but then heightened by all the fucking coffee I drank from working before the meet. I started shaking, I couldn't lift my head up. My girlfriend and I stepped out for a smoke, and I told her the situation, the guys moved away... they were hot too so thanks to my anxiety I missed out yet again on another golden opportunity. But once we got back to our seats, I told my girl that I recently got close to that I had anxiety and the symptoms, just casually because at this point its just a thing I have to tell people, but this time it wasn't to a fellow artist or designer, she was a nurse. Instead of saying yeah I have it to or yeah we all get like that, she asked me further questions.", "Disclaimer: I don't intend to bad-mouth Mirtazapine here, its side effects and somewhat \"dulling\" effect on the mind for some people (during the first few months) has likely been discussed enough here. Some feel nothing at all, others feel like zombies. Totally individual. I trust and maintain that the benefits of proper use, together with conversational therapy, is very efficient for many people, and I hope this has been said on this sub. I feel a need to share my own experience, though, in the hopes that it will be of some help to someone who might be reacting the same way as I did to Mirtazapine's well-recorded increase in appetite.", "I also used to get really bad nightmares about dying and the afterlife when I was a kid and my mom would have to rub my chest til I fell asleep. I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didn\u00ca\u00bbt want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldn\u00ca\u00bbt want to compare my stress to that. Just wondering if it\u00ca\u00bbs possible that this is like mild \"anxiety\" or I am just sleep deprived? Also if its possible that anxiety can be come back after a decade of not having any noticeable events? Thanks ahead of time for any help.", "These thoughts are always a great source of frustration to me especially when Im close to an artistic deadline like a gallery exposition that is coming soon. Im never confident enough to show what I do. Even the minister of culture in my country has made some very positive criticisms about it but my mind always goes back to thinking those people are only saying these things to be nice. Honestly, does anyone else feel that way? What do you do when this happens?", "I desperately need a car and found a great opportunity but the previous owner died of a heart attack in it. Thats my number one cause of anxiety, the fear of heart attacks. He was relatively healthy and young. I feel like a big idiot for not taking it. But I have vivid nightmares of me having heart attacks then I wake up with a panic attack that lasts hours.", "3. Watch telenovelas (if you haven't seen the drama in those shows, it makes you forget about anxiety pretty quick. After all, who will Jane choose, Michael or Rafael??) 4. Go for a walk, though now that my new employment is 15 minutes away each way via walking, I am getting some decent walking in 5 days a week.", "I've been trying to avoid social media because I know how anxiety provoking it can be for me. I joined it ultimately because I thought it would make me feel more connected to people. It kind of does, which I'm okay with. But of course, now I'm looking at everyone's highlight reels and friend count (which I'm especially envious of) and I can't help but feel like crap. My social life came to a standstill in my early 20s when I compartmentalized all facets of my life, ensuring the people I knew never intermingled.", "This has been affecting me for two weeks now, off and on. It's a combination of terrifying and annoying. Randomly throughout the day, I will notice that it feels harder to breathe and I take deeper breaths than normal. Air coming in almost feels like it has viscosity to it, like molasses, which makes me cough. Most of the time, I don't cough up anything so it's dry.", "I've heard it's less activating and more calming than Zoloft, as it's the most serotonin selective. I've also heard Trazodone may be an option, for someone who wants SSRI-like-effects without any activation. Additionally, my Psych doctor mentioned Gabapentin as a way to directly target anxiety without any of the long-term concerns of daily benzo use. (though I've read it's not without its own drawbacks.) Obviously, this wouldn't have any serotonergic effect, but could be a good alternative to the Xanax.", "Anyway, long story short, he came over, we had a blast, we had dinner, watched a movie, cuddled, and he fell asleep on me. Four nights later the same thing happened :-) On our second date he told me he had anxiety issues and I just tried to listen to him. He's Spanish so English is his second language, which probably doesn't help his anxiety when talking to an American. Last night he came over and he told me had anxiety and depression issues and he's seeing a doctor.", "The first six months I had her she lived in a cage that could have fit two rats, the next year and a half she lived in a cage that could have fit four rats (this is following the formula where you multiply the dimensions of the cage in inches and divide it by 3456. The result tells you how many rats you can comfortably have in one cage.) I loved buying her new toys and treats and seeing how she took them. Trying new foods on her was one of my favorite things to do. The only issue is that I didn't really let her out of the cage much.", "This even negatively impacts me more because it causes me relationship anxiety, every time I have a freak out about travelling I start getting intrusive thoughts like \"what if I get there and realize I don't love him or I'm not attracted to him\" or when he sends me a text that makes me happy my anxiety creeps in saying that I'm secretly forcing any positive feelings I have for him. I know these are linked to my travel anxiety because they only pop up AFTER I've had a moment of freaking out thinking about the travel. Whenever we Skype, just talking to him feels like home, and talking about the upcoming trip feels just exciting, not nerve-wracking. This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it. I need to figure out how to calm all this anticipatory anxiety so I can just let myself enjoy my relationship, the excitement leading up to our trip, and even the trip itself (although I feel like once I'm there I'll be fine)!", "I just told them I had too much anxiety and breaking up with my boyfriend made me really depressed. And that I didn't know what I'm going to do, maybe I'll find a job. So now I just stay home and go on my computer all day. I leave the house maybe twice a week. I have constant feelings about being useless and that I'd be better off dead.", "So earlier today I was suffering from extreme derealization, depression, and anxiety. So what I did is I let the thoughts free and whenever I got a tnhoguht I ignored it and I think I just suppressed my anxiety deep down. Now instead of having a panic attack I'm having body symptoms of it. I can't think myself form the symptoms. I can't find the trigger it just happened.", "I can't begin to summarise how I feel about her. I want to spend the rest of my life with this person, but I want to help work through this stuff together. Once she goes into an anxiety spiral I'm completely at a loss of what to do apart from hold her and stroke her hair. What strategies can help break the spiral when she starts one, and how can I approach the topic of seeing a counsellor and developing mindfulness strategies without her going into a panic attack? Help me /r/anxiety, you're my only hope.", "Edit 2: This thread got so much more attention than I could have imagined, there's been so many people offering advice and sharing their life experiences. I don't think I've ever seen so much helpfulness and friendliness on the internet before and I just want to say thank you. I think I still have a long way to go, maybe these thought's will never disappear but today has been the best day since they began and it's in a large part due to the people who spoke on this thread.

We were such good friends once, but I have to admit we hadn't talked about art or writing (the things that made us friends) for years. My anxiety has muddied the waters, and maybe all my shit and all my emotional abuse crap did ruin everything and it was all my fault. Maybe I did end things because I'd felt blamed for 2 months straight and just wanted to get away from the anxiety it was all causing me. Maybe I should have been the one to grovel, because I'd fucked up so bad over the situation.", "I didnt sleep that night and eventually was fine. Since then my anxiety has gotten worse- scary movies linger in my thoughts a little longer. Ive had a few mini panic attacks. I cant get intoxicated anymore Bc I dont like my mind being In a different state. I feel like a darkness is over me and I just feel scared all the time.", "Which forced me to acknowledge that I havent been performing to my own expectations. Enter the anxiety attack.

Really, the only time I play video games is after work (which is normally after 8:30pm) or when Im off. Even when Im off, I still do chores and such between playing games. Even though Im good at getting this stuff done, I still feel like theres this weight on my shoulders that I should do MORE. Even when I cut video games out of the equation (which I did for the last week and a half) I still dont do MORE because Im normally too tired to do anything else.", "Hey guys, I'm 31, moved to a new city with my wife for the first time back in October, and am experiencing on and off anxiety for more or less the first time in my life.

But, bear in mind, your brain is trying to help you, it wants to \"check\" that these things are safe. Your brain also likes to save energy. So if you DON'T RESPOND to a thought, your brain will get the message that this thought wasn't \"useful\" and stop throwing it at you.", "Today was a horrible day from the get go and I had to call out because I cant function with other people (I work in retail) today so I claimed I had a fever. Of course it had to be memorial day weekend making it one of the worst times for this and they even of course said over the phone \"Well, this really puts us in a bind\". Now I'm absolutely paranoid that they'll find out or they hate me now or I'll get fired for this.

So I just feel like crawling into my little isolation hole and being sad by myself while knowing that everyone hates me... to be honest I dont know why Im overthinking it cause honestly no one would care if I did isolate myself.

Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with \"I wanted to see you more than anything.\" At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.", "Not a huge amount of weight, but it was a big deal for me.

Its a weird tick, I don't know how to describe it.", "\u00c2\u00b7 Did your parent/parents not provide healthy meals or enough daily exercise or activities? \u00c2\u00b7 Why didnt you change the habits when you became of age? \u00c2\u00b7 Do you cook? \u00c2\u00b7 Are you too busy? \u00c2\u00b7 Have you made a daily planner of your day to be able to notice where you have an opportunity to be able to prep meals and cook more?", "Hey guys, Been married for about a little over a year. I had an inkling before we got married that the wife was an anxious person but it was only after we got married I realised it was much more. She has weekly breakdowns over minor occurrences at work and comes home cursing and screaming about what goes on. (Not at me, but that repeated venting does have its toll on me as well mentally.", "Im so mad. Since April I spoke with four professors: all for course evaluations and two for letters of Rec. They all agreed and I send them the necessary documents. I just called to check the file at my university and out of all those professors, only one submitted a course evaluation. I apply for a masters in a month and have no letters, despite having periodically emailed to update these professors.", "Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns.

We live in a 2 bedroom 1.5 bath home with our 2 dogs, a cat and a rabbit. We are in our late 50's and lived a quiet life prior to the storm. 2 weeks ago 11 of my wife's family members and 6 dogs came to ride out the storm at our home. Unfortunately 8 of them now have no home to go back to, nor do their 5 dogs.", "Rubbing with shoulders with people and socializing too frequently may also be source of stress as the soul and body needs to re-energize it frequently. This is similar to the phoenix rising from the ashes to become a stronger self- a dramatic example which, yet all too relevant. **Leave your Comfort Zone** The familiar can also be a cause of stress ass the more used to you is to familiarity the more stress any unknown element will give you. Its best to change ones surroundings and indulge in new activities to push yourself to your limit.", "Your responses to the survey items will be anonymous and kept confidential.

I currently have about $8 to my name from my savings, which has since been overdrawn. I have been looking for a new job, staying at this one because I have a good boss and because it pays above minimum wage. People effortlessly walk all over her, and though she gets mad about it, company policy as well as her personal precedence, has really tied her hands. I'm one of about three reliable people, and get saddled with the shifts no one bothers to show up to.", "I just need to vent and receive some advice/ encouragement. I just went through major jaw surgery (I replaced the TMJ joint disk with a fat graft) and my mouth is now wired shut for the next 9 months. To fill the time I would have spent talking, eating, and generally having a good time, I have instead been studying for all the standardized tests I need to go to a good college. I studied at least 4 hours a day and put a strain on my recovery (this is because my upper body muscles were strained which affects my jaw and subsequently my new disk). Luckily, my hard work payed off.", "Long story short: Worked in a call centre for 4 years for a vehicle breakdown service, starting to not be able to cope with it any more due to a combination of things (change in management, not enough staff for a constantly expanding customer base, rewards based on whether your face \"fits\" rather than actual demonstrable achievements, etc). Unable to relax after work, constantly thinking/dreading going to work. Get random mood swings about it, either intensely rageful, or wanting to burst in to tears. Headaches that go on for 3 or 4 days at a time are now a regular occurence. Starting to manifest in other physical ways (unable to sleep, constantly weary, having a lot more sickness than usual).", "Only 7 years ago at the age of 9 I think I peaked in life. I was possibly the most fun kid in class and had no problem socializing with others. Used to be so happy then. Now Im just known by everybody as the quiet guy who rarely ever smiles. Interacting with others (especially girls) is so hard, and Im always so conscious about how I look.", "I have completely given up hobbies and interests outside work. I do not have time to engage in them. Things that I could normally do to relax, like exercise or yoga, are absolutely out of the question because I work 16 hours a day. 3. I am frequently sleep deprived due to my work hours.", "The main source of this stress is a scholarship I am on that requires payback if you lose it, meaning I would be in the whole about $20,000 if I fail and get kicked out. The contract states you can either be kicked out or placed on probation, but I cannot find any precedent on what direction they lean. Without diving into many specifics on this class and the great, and I emphasize great, impact it can have on this scholarship \\(I wouldn't be able to get my AE degree\\), I was hoping I could find some advice on increasing my productivity and generally improving my mental/physical health. I am reaching here, I really need some help. My fiance, bless her heart, is not much help because of planning the wedding and I don't have a lot of close friends/confidants.", "Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns.

I need a way to maintain until I can get out. A couple of years ago, when it started getting bad, I coped by drinking a lot more and being a couch potato. But that's bad for me and my family, not working, so I've stopped. I went on a two week business trip.", "-\tYou must own an iPhone or iPod touch (5th generation) in order to participate, and you can earn up to $35 for completing the study. -\tIf you are eligible, you will be asked to download an iOS app called REPS.

At this point, you can see that my dad like to \"collect\" things but it not like our house looks like and episode of Hoarders (yet). Fast forward 18 months, I'm transferring to a college closer to home. Between traveling and not being able to find a job in the barely populated, conservative, town I was in, it was in the best interest. Also a key point, I changed my major from Veterinarian Bio to general Psychology since my hometown college didn't have vet bio."]}}
