Rangel, D-New York) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of the Tax Extenders Act of 2009.  Passage \nof this bill will provide much-needed relief to families and businesses who are struggling in the \ncurrent economic downturn.   \n \nAs the Nation\u2019s economy recovers from the economic crisis, this legislation includes several \nprovisions that will encourage companies to invest in new technologies and hire more workers.  \nH.R. 4213 will extend the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit for another year, \nencouraging businesses to increase investments in technology and create more high-tech jobs for \nthe twenty-first century.  The legislation also extends the tax credit for biodiesel and renewable \ndiesel, providing clean energy companies with the certainty they need to make critical \ninvestments in the Nation\u2019s energy future.  The Administration is also pleased with the extension \nof the new markets tax credit.  Since its establishment in 2000, this credit has stimulated private \ninvestment in economically depressed communities, helping to build schools and health care \nfacilities as well as providing entrepreneurs with the resources to succeed.  \n \nFinally, the Administration commends the House for paying for this job-creating legislation in a \nfiscally-responsible manner that is consistent with other legislative priorities including health \ncare.  The legislation would fulfill the Administration\u2019s commitment to crack down on overseas \ntax havens and put a stop to billions of dollars worth of tax abuse and would end the special \npreferential tax treatment for carried interest income. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  December 8, 2010   \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 3992 \u2013 Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act of 2010 \n(Sen. Durbin, D-Illinois, and Sen. Leahy, D-Vermont) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3992, which would address the \nimmigration status of certain individuals who came to the United States as children, know this \nNation as their home, and, by their actions, are contributing to the prosperity and security of the \nUnited States.  The DREAM Act would provide conditional nonimmigrant status to individuals \nwho:  (1) came to the United States before turning 16 years old; (2) have lived continuously in \nthe United States for at least five years prior to the date of enactment; (3) were under the age of \n30 on the date of enactment; (4) demonstrate good moral character; (5) are not inadmissible or \ndeportable under a number of key grounds; and (6) have graduated from high school, have \nobtained a GED certificate, or have been admitted to an institution of higher education in the \nUnited States.   \n \nBefore these individuals could apply for permanent resident status in the United States, they \nwould have to meet additional requirements \u2013 in particular, completion of at least two years of \neither college or military service.  The young people who would be eligible for relief under the \nDREAM Act are prime examples of the need for comprehensive immigration reform that is \nbased on requiring accountability and responsibility from all \u2013 the government, employers, and \nthose who have entered the country illegally.  The present system is broken and the \nAdministration continues to call on the Congress to pass comprehensive reform.  While the \nbroader immigration debate continues, the Administration urges the Senate to take this important \nstep and pass the DREAM Act.  Young people who have spent much of their lives in the United \nStates and want to improve their lives and their Nation by pursuing higher education or \ndefending the United States as members of the Armed Forces should be given this opportunity to \nearn legal status.   \n \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \nJune 8, 2010 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n S.J. Res. 26 \u2013 Disapproval of EPA Endangerment Rule and Cause and Contribute Findings \n  (Sen. Murkowski, R-Alaska, and 40 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S.J. Res. 26, which would undermine the \nClean Air Act and hinder EPA\u2019s ability to comply with a Supreme Court ruling on greenhouse \ngasses (GHGs).  The Administration believes that comprehensive energy and climate legislation \nis the most effective way to transition to a clean energy economy that will create jobs, protect the \nenvironment, and increase national security.  S.J. Res. 26 would do just the opposite; it would \nincrease the Nation\u2019s dependence on oil and other fossil fuels and block efforts to cut pollution \nthat threatens our health and well-being.  \n \nSpecifically, passage of S.J. Res. 26 would block implementation of an historic, multi-agency \nFederal program set in motion by the Administration to promote fuel economy standards that \nwill reduce oil consumption, save American consumers more than $3,000 in fuel costs over the \nlifetime of a model year 2016 vehicle, and limit pollution from tailpipe emissions.  S.J. Res. 26 \nalso would undermine the Administration\u2019s efforts to reduce the negative impacts of pollution \nand the risks associated with environmental catastrophes, like the ongoing BP oil spill.  As seen \nin the Gulf of Mexico, environmental disasters harm families, destroy jobs, and pollute the \nNation\u2019s air, land and water.  Further, S.J. Res. 26 is contrary to the widely-accepted scientific \nconsensus that GHGs are at increasingly dangerous concentrations and are contributing to the \nthreat of climate change.  S.J. Res. 26 would strip EPA of its authority to protect the public from \nGHG pollution, and thus prevent it from following its statutory obligations as interpreted by the \nSupreme Court. \n \nFinally, S.J. Res. 26 would undo EPA\u2019s carefully constructed approach to reducing pollution \ngenerated by the largest oil companies, oil refineries, and other large-scale polluters.  EPA\u2019s \nreasoned approach will provide industry certainty, which is essential to jumpstarting private -\nsector investments and innovation in clean, renewable energy.  S.J. Res. 26 would block the \nUnited States from taking action to control environmentally damaging GHGs while other nations \ntake the lead in transitioning to clean energy economies that create the jobs of the future. \n \nIf the President is presented with this Resolution of Disapproval, which would seriously disrupt \nEPA\u2019s ability to address the threat of GHG pollution, as well as the multi-agency Federal GHG \nand fuel economy program, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the Resolution. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  December 8, 2010 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 847 \u2013 James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 \n(Rep.

The Administration has the deepest respect and gratitude for this \nNation\u2019s 9/11 heroes.  The President is committed to ensuring that rescue and recovery workers, \nresidents, students, and others suffering from health consequences related to the World Trade \nCenter disaster have access to the monitoring and treatment they need.  The President looks \nforward to signing a 9/11 health bill into law to help those whose health and livelihoods were \ndevastated by the events of September 11, 2001.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to meet the needs of \nour 9/11 heroes and to strengthen the World Trade Center Health program. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n   \n  March 2, 2010 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nSenate Amendment 3336 to H.R. 4213 \u2014 American Workers, State, and Business Relief Act of 2010 \n(Sen. Baucus, D-Montana) \n \nThe Administration supports Senate passage of the proposed substitute amendment 3336 to  \nH.R. 4213.  Passage of this bill will provide much-needed relief to families and to hard-pressed States \nwhile encouraging continued job creation by America\u2019s businesses.  The importance of longer-term \nextensions for various authorities and programs \u2013 and the certainty that such extensions bring \u2013 has been \nhighlighted by the severe problems caused by interruptions in authorities for these programs. \n \nH.R. 4213 includes several important provisions, including:  (1) an extension of extended unemployment \ninsurance and COBRA subsidies through the end of the year, including reforms to improve COBRA \nsubsidies; (2) prevention of dramatic cuts in reimbursements for doctors in Medicare along with \nextensions of other important health provisions; (3) an extension of increased American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act (ARRA) Federal Medical Assistance Percentage rates that allow for enhanced Federal \nsupport for State Medicaid programs; (4) an extension of subsidies so that the Small Business \nAdministration can continue certain lending programs with reduced fees and higher guarantees through the \nend of the fiscal year; and (5) targeted pension-funding relief. \n \nThe bill also includes several other important measures supported by the Administration.  The extensions \nto expiring tax cuts include several provisions that will encourage companies to invest in new technologies \nand create more high-tech jobs for the 21st century, including extending the research and experimentation \n(R&E) tax credit for another year.  The legislation also extends the tax credit for biodiesel and renewable \ndiesel, providing clean energy companies with the certainty they need to make critical investments in the \nNation\u2019s energy future. \n \nThe Administration also supports the inclusion of other important extensions, either in this bill or in future \nlegislation. These provisions include:  (1) an extension and expansion of the TANF Emergency Fund; (2) \nan extension of bonus depreciation; (3) an extension of Economic Recovery Payments; and (4) the \nexpansion of oversubscribed ARRA programs, including the 48C tax credit for manufacturing and TIGER \ngrants for transportation. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on these and additional \nmeasures to spur private sector job creation.   \n \n*  *  *  *  *  *  * \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  December 8, 2010 \n   (Senate) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nS. 3985 \u2013 Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act of 2010 \n(Sen.

This bill would ensure that seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities \nreceive a one-time $250 payment in 2011 and would support individuals struggling in the face of \nthe economic downturn.  Over 2009 and 2010, most of these individuals also benefited from a \nsimilar one-time payment.

Frank, D-Massachusetts)  \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 4173.  The President has called on \nthe Congress to enact far-reaching financial reform legislation to overhaul the Nation\u2019s financial \nsystem in the wake of the financial collapse last year, setting forth clear objectives and principles \nthat were endorsed by Congressional leaders.  Financial reform is critical:  to put in place rules \nthat will allow the Nation\u2019s markets to promote innovation while discouraging abuse; to create a \nframework in which markets can function freely and fairly, without the fragility in which normal \nbusiness cycles bring the risk of financial collapse; and to provide a system that works for \nbusinesses and consumers. \n \nThe Administration commends the House Financial Services Committee for its extraordinary \nefforts in developing comprehensive financial reform legislation, and also supports provisions \nintended to promote diversity.  House passage will move the Nation another important step \ntowards necessary, comprehensive financial reform that will create clear rules, consistent and \nsystematic enforcement of those rules, and thus a more stable financial system with better \nprotection for consumers and investors. \n  \nAs with any legislation of this scale and complexity, the Administration looks forward to \ncontinuing to work with Congress, as financial reform moves through the legislative process, to \ncontinue to strengthen key provisions and to achieve successful comprehensive reform. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nJuly 9, 2009 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3082 \u2013 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2010 \n(Rep. Obey, D-Wisconsin) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3082, making appropriations for \nmilitary construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2010.  \n\u00a0\nFor the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), this legislation answers the President\u2019s call to \nexpand the care and benefits that the Nation provides to our Veterans.  The President has put \nforward a plan to increase funding for the VA by $25 billion over the next five years, honoring \nVeterans\u2019 service by providing more generous funding for their health care.  The President also \nwould create Centers of Excellence for VA medical care, with specialty services in areas like \nprosthetics, vision, spinal cord injury, aging, and women\u2019s health.  Importantly, the President \nbelieves that the VA must be better prepared to care for the Veterans of current conflicts with \nspecial focus on mental health screening and treatment for conditions such as post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and traumatic brain injury.  The VA will provide better outreach in rural areas with new \nVet Centers and mobile health clinics. \n \nThe legislation, as considered by the Committee, rises to the President\u2019s challenge.  It invests \ncritical new dollars in programs that will significantly improve the quality of care and services for \nour Nation\u2019s Veterans.  Millions of patients, including more than 419,000 Veterans of Iraq and \nAfghanistan, will receive medical treatment as a result of these investments.  The legislation takes \nimportant steps forward to support the Administration\u2019s efforts to transform the VA into an agile, \nadaptive organization that is responsive to the changing needs of the Veteran community.   \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nMilitary Construction \n \nThe Administration appreciates the overall level of funding provided for military construction \nprojects.  However, the Administration is concerned that this bill funds several of these projects \nincrementally, including a critical National Security Agency data center.  Consistent with the \nPresident\u2019s Budget, the Administration encourages full funding of these programs to make the \nmost efficient use of taxpayer resources. \n  Department of Veterans Affairs \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for VA and for providing advance \nappropriations for VA\u2019s Medical Care accounts so that Veterans will always be provided, without \ninterruption, timely, accessible, and high-quality medical care they deserve. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMay 27, 2010 \n (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5136 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 \n(Rep. Skelton, D-Missouri, and Rep. McKeon, R-California) \n \nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5136, the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2011.  The Administration appreciates the House Armed Services \nCommittee's continued support of our national defense, including, among other things, its \nsupport for the Department's topline budget requests for both the base budget and for overseas \ncontingency operations.  \n \nThe Administration welcomes the Committee's support for authorities that assist the ability of the \nwarfighter to operate in unconventional and irregular warfare, authorities that are important to \nfield commanders, such as the Commanders' Emergency Response Program and the authority to \nreimburse coalition partners.  The Administration also welcomes the Committee\u2019s support to \nimplement recommendations to prevent and prosecute sexual assaults.   \n \nWhile there are many areas of agreement with the Committee\u2019s bill as reported, the \nAdministration has serious concerns with the enormous burden placed on the Department of \nDefense, including potentially limiting its ability to effectively advance its priorities and \nstreamline operations.  Additionally, the Administration has serious concerns with a number of \nprovisions that would constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions or that \ndepart from the decisions reflected in the President's Fiscal Year 2011 Budget, which carefully \nbalanced fiscal constraints, program performance, strategic needs and capabilities.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns, some of \nwhich are outlined in more detail below, and others which may be identified in the classified \nannex once it is made available. \n \nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Extra Engine:  The Administration strongly objects to the  \naddition of $485 million for the extra engine program and to associated legislative provisions \nthat limit the obligation of overall JSF development funding to 75 percent of the amount \nauthorized until the funds for FY 2011 have been obligated for the extra engine program, require \nthe Secretary to ensure that each budget in the Future Years Defense Plan include, and expend, \nsufficient funding to continue the program, and designate the F135 and F136 engine \ndevelopment and procurement programs as major subprograms.  As Secretary Gates has noted, \neven after factoring in Congress\u2019 additional funding, the extra engine would still require a further \ninvestment of $2.4 billion before it could be considered as a viable extra engine for the JSF \nprogram.  The Department does not believe that this cost will ever be recovered in a \nhypothesized competition or that the funds should be diverted from important defense needs.  \nThe current engine is performing well with more than 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test \nhours.  If the final bill presented to the President includes funding or a legislative direction to \ncontinue an extra engine program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto. \n  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program:  The Administration strongly objects to provisions of the bill \nwhich could limit the procurement of the 42 aircraft requested in the President\u2019s FY 2011 \nBudget.  The onerous restrictions impose unacceptable schedule and budget risks on the JSF \nprogram.  While the Department believes the restructured development schedule is achievable, \nfailure to achieve any one of the criteria would affect the procurement decision with significant \nimpact on unit cost, production ramp, and TACAIR force structure.  The Department's F-35 \nprocurement request is in line with independent manufacturing studies, risk review \nrecommendations, and the FY11 request reflects an optimized production.  If the final bill \npresented to the President contains provisions that would seriously disrupt the F-35 program, the \nPresident\u2019s senior advisors would recommend a veto.  \n \nC-17 Aircraft:  The Administration appreciates that the Committee supports the President\u2019s \nbudget request regarding the C-17 program and that it did not authorize procurement of \nadditional C-17 aircraft.   \n \nAircraft Retirements:  The Administration objects to provisions that restrict aircraft retirements. \nThe Air Force uses the Total Force to project forces and meet airlift demand.  The Department \nmanages its fleet as a sum of the parts and not as individual components.  Retirements \naccompanied by modifications and other enablers provide a smaller, but more flexible, lethal, \nand capable force.  The restriction impairs the Department's ability to effectively manage its fleet \nas good stewards of the taxpayer\u2019s dollar. \n \nMultiyear Procurement of FA-18E/F and EA-18G Aircraft:  The Administration objects to \nSection 122, which directs the reinvestment of future year savings realized from the execution of \nthis multiyear procurement contract back into the procurement of additional F/A-18E or F/A18F \naircraft.  The Administration must retain the authority to apply these funds consistent with \nDepartmental priorities and the demands of national defense.   \n \nDecommissioning of Naval Vessels:  The Administration strongly opposes the requirement to \nretain two ships \u2013 the USS NASSAU (LHA 4) and the USS PELELIU (LHA 5) \u2013 in service and \nto the specific limitation of decommissioning no more than 2 ships for every 3 ships \ncommissioned.  The Department is committed to replacing older, less capable ships that have \nbecome increasingly expensive to maintain and operate with ships better suited for current and \nfuture needs that will provide forces the capability to meet a wider range of Combatant \nCommanders\u2019 requirements.  Additionally, the Administration objects to Section 1022\u2019s \nburdensome new notification requirements for decommissioning any battle force vessel of the \nactive Fleet.   \n \nUnified Medical Command:  The Administration strongly objects to the provision in the bill to \nauthorize the President to create a new military medical command.   The proposed delegation of \nresponsibilities to a unified medical command would render hollow the role of the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)) to serve as the principal Departmental \nofficial for health and medical matters.  The imposition of additional organizational structure \nwith the attendant personnel and operational costs it would require could directly conflict with \nthe effort by the Administration to eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic layers, headquarters and \ndefense organizations.  \n \nBuilding Partner Capacity:  The Administration urges the inclusion of its requested proposals, \nwhich were developed with close coordination between the Departments of Defense and State, to \n2  build the capacity of partner-nation special and conventional forces.  Among other things, these \nproposals are important for the implementation of U.S. policy in Afghanistan, to enhance and \nincrease coalition participation in Afghanistan in order to reduce the pressure on U.S. forces, and \nto support the drawdown strategy in Iraq and counter-terrorism programs.  Of particular concern \nare provisions relating to the use of critical funding for Yemen Ministry of Interior counter-\nterrorism forces and restrictions on efforts to develop Iraqi Security Forces that can \nindependently provide for internal security by December 2011.  The Administration appreciates \nCongressional concerns for equal contributions from the Government of Iraq and is working to \nensure Iraq\u2019s overall cost share requirement.   \n \nEarly Infantry Brigade Combat Team (E-IBCT), Increment 1 Equipment:  The Administration \nobjects to language in Section 111 prohibiting the Secretary of Defense from procuring more \nthan two brigade sets of E-IBCT equipment.  The Administration also opposes the removal of \n$626.7 million in Fiscal Year 2011 E-IBCT procurement funding as this action will delay \nfielding of E-IBCT capabilities to deploying forces by at least 16 months.  These actions will \nincrease the overall cost to the program and increase the risk of a break in production. \n \nMilitary Pay Raise: The Administration values the service members of the U.S. Armed Forces \nand believes that the President\u2019s proposed 1.4 percent pay increase is appropriate in light of other \nbenefits and other forms of compensation, is targeted to avoid hindering the Department\u2019s ability \nto focus on recruiting or retaining for key skills, and will ensure the availability of financial \nresources needed to sustain our combat power at a time of war.  \n \nDefense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS):  The Administration objects to the \nDCIPS provision, which negates the purpose of conducting an independent review of DCIPS as \nrequired by the FY 2010 national defense authorization bill.  The National Academy of Public \nAdministration (NAPA) is expected to deliver its final report to Congress by June 1, 2010; the \nSecretary of Defense has until August 1, 2010, to report to Congress describing actions he \nproposes to take in response to the report.  Legislating a continued freeze to DCIPS for another \nyear will preclude the Secretary of Defense from being able to take meaningful action based on \nthe NAPA review. \n \nMissile Defense:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for missile defense \nprograms, especially for the new Phased Adaptive Approach for Missile Defense in Europe.  \nHowever, the Department is concerned that the restriction on \u201cpreparation of equipment\u201d in \nSection 221 could severely undermine the development, adaptation, and testing of equipment \nthat is essential for missile defense cooperation in Europe as well as in other regions.  \n \nGuam:  The Administration is committed to addressing the needs on Guam (both on base and \noff) to allow for the realignment of Marines and their families from Japan.  That effort requires a \ncomprehensive government-wide approach.  The Administration is concerned with the \nprovisions of the bill that suggest Guam infrastructure improvements are an exclusive DOD \nfinancial responsibility rather than a shared inter-agency, intergovernmental effort led by DOD.    \n \nNew Requirements Imposed on Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 \nRecommendations:  The Administration opposes Section 2711.  The Administration has \nrepeatedly opposed any legislative provision that modifies, delays, repeals, or otherwise impedes \nimplementation of a BRAC recommendation.  These restrictions are unnecessary and set an \nundesirable precedent on addressing challenging BRAC execution issues.   \n3   \nIncremental and Forward Funding:  The Administration is concerned that the bill authorizes \nincremental funding for certain Navy ships and certain military construction projects.  The \nAdministration also objects to authority for $65 million of long-lead procurement of future \nAN/TPY-2 radar equipment because the funding is in advance of need and would incrementally \nfund a capability that should be fully funded in future budgets.  As a matter of fiscal prudence, \nthe Administration encourages full funding of these programs, consistent with the Budget.  \n \n*  *  *  *  *  *  * \n \n4  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nSeptember 17, 2009 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2996 \u2014 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2010 \n(Sen.

It also funds critical \nactivities to protect the health of the American people, the environment in which we live, and the \nmodernized 21st Century infrastructure that is vital to our economy. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding specific \nprovisions in the Committee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nAdministration Priorities \n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of \n$400 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, but urges the Congress to fully fund the \nPresident\u2019s request of $475 million.  The Administration also commends the Committee for fully \nfunding the remaining two Water Security pilot projects.  The lessons learned from these pilot \nprojects will provide water systems nationwide with tools to effectively protect their critical water \ninfrastructure.   \n \nWildland Fires.  The Administration appreciates the support of the Committee in providing \nrequested funding amounts for wildfire suppression operations and amounts equal to the request \nfor the new Wildland Fire Suppression Contingency Reserve of the Department of Agriculture \nForest Service and the Department of the Interior.  However, the Administration has significant \nconcerns about merging Contingency Reserves funding into the base fire programs of the agencies. \n  \nIndian Health Service.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the \nPresident\u2019s initiative to expand health care services through the Indian Health Service, but urges \nthe Congress to remove a provision that restricts the ability of Alaska Natives to decide if they will \nadminister the programs that benefit their communities.  \n \nEfficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support \nfor proposed reductions, including the termination of grants for local water infrastructure that have \nachieved their purpose. The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the President\u2019s other  proposals, especially for those items that fund narrowly focused activities or duplicate existing \nprograms that accomplish similar goals. \n \nDepartment of the Interior \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for climate change funding for the \nInterior Department but strongly encourages the Congress to fully fund the request, including $40 \nmillion to help States plan and implement activities to help wildlife adapt to the impacts of climate \nchange.   \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to provide the $30 million increase requested for programs \nto help teach youth about conservation through outdoor activities, such as hunting and fishing.  \nThe Administration also suggests that the Congress fund Park Partnership project grants as \nrequested, to leverage non-Federal dollars and engage partners in preparation for the 100th \nanniversary of the National Park System. \n \nThe Congress is urged not to include a provision that will allow Federal funding through the \nOffice of Surface Mining to be used as non-Federal cost share funds for other agency programs.  \nUnder this provision, the Federal Government would in effect bear the full cost of projects, in \nessence waving cost share. \n \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA)  \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of our national forests but has concerns \nwith the Committee\u2019s decision to transfer funds to the National Forest System account rather than \nprovide funding for the President\u2019s Protecting National Forests Initiative.  The Administration \nurges the Congress to fully fund the request in order to permit greater flexibility in protecting \nnatural resources and maintaining facilities.   \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of funding for the USDA Forest Service \nportion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but urges the Congress to fully fund the Forest \nLegacy program component.  The Budget reflects broad support of forest-based economic \ndevelopment and the Administration encourages the Congress to reconsider its approach to the \nEconomic Action Program, which is duplicative of other Federal programs.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nFebruary 22, 2010 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nSenate Amendment 3310 to H.R. 2847 \u2014 Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act \n(Sen.

Inouye, D-Hawaii) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 3326, with the Senate Committee-\nreported text, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2010. \n \nThe Administration is committed to keeping the United States military the strongest and most \ncapable military in the world.  The President\u2019s strategy increases training, resources, and support \nfor the U.S. Armed Forces.  To keep the United States secure, the Armed Forces must have \nsufficient resources to prevail in current operations while maintaining and developing new \ncapabilities to deter potential adversaries and prepare for other risks and contingencies.  This \nlegislation, as approved by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, advances many initiatives in \nline with the President\u2019s goals. \n \nThe President and the Nation\u2019s military leadership have put forward a strategy for Afghanistan and \nPakistan so that all elements of national power are engaged and integrated in an effort to defeat  \nal Qaeda and prevent attacks on the homeland as well as on U.S. allies and partners.  In Iraq, the \nUnited States is moving forward with a responsible drawdown of combat forces, having \ntransferred security responsibilities to Iraq\u2019s forces.  The legislation, as approved by the \nCommittee, provides critical resources to enable this to happen. \n \nThe Administration has recognized the importance of requesting a full year\u2019s resources for these \noperations.  Providing full-year funding will give troops carrying out operations overseas the \nability to plan operations more effectively and will cause far less disruption in base programs.  By \nproviding a full year\u2019s funding up front for these operations, the Committee follows through on the \nPresident\u2019s request, and ends the disruptions caused by relying on supplemental funding.  In \naddition, the Administration urges the Congress to clearly delineate war spending from base \nfunding in both classified and unclassified programs, as presented in the President\u2019s request.   \n \nSupporting servicemembers and their families is a top priority for the President and the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD).  This includes increasing the size of the Army to reduce the strain \non military families, and additional help to put an end to the practice of holding servicemembers \npast their initial commitment.  It also includes easing the burdens on U.S. troops and their families \nwith increased pay, quality child care, job training for spouses, and expanded counseling and \noutreach to families that have experienced the separation and stress of war.  The legislation builds \non the progress in the Fiscal Year 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act with necessary resources \nto meet these commitments. \n  The President has also requested significant new resources for military medical care, with \nadditional Army wounded-warrior complexes and increased resources to address traumatic brain \ninjuries and mental health needs.  The Committee legislation meets the President\u2019s goals with \nfunding that advances first-class medical care for servicemembers and their families. \n \nThe Administration believes that, while the Committee has made important investments in the \nNation\u2019s defense, there are significant ways in which the current bill can be strengthened and looks \nforward to working with the Congress on this effort. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nSupport for the President\u2019s Priorities.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support \nfor the President\u2019s initiatives proposed to reshape our military posture and get the most benefit \nfrom every Defense budget dollar.  The Administration commends the Committee for its support \nfor the termination of programs that are no longer needed or are not performing as intended.  The \nAdministration appreciates that the Committee does not include unrequested funding for three \nsuch programs that could result in a veto \u2013 unrequested advance procurement funding for the F-22 \nfighter aircraft, the continued development of the Joint Strike Fighter Alternate Engine, and \nadditional funding for the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter Program.  The Congress is urged to \noppose funding these programs during floor action and in conference. \n \nC-17 Transport Aircraft.  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $2.5 billion in \nfunding for 10 unrequested C-17 airlift aircraft.  Analyses by DOD have shown that the 205 C-17s \nin the force and on order, together with the existing fleet of C-5 aircraft, are sufficient to meet the \nDepartment\u2019s future airlift needs, even under the most stressing situations.  \nOperation and Maintenance (O&M).  The Administration strongly opposes the bill\u2019s reductions \ntotaling over $3 billion from O&M accounts (excluding Defense Health Program) \u2013 through direct \ncuts and cuts mandated in sections 8091 and 8100.  These reductions would hurt force readiness \nand increase stress on military people and equipment. \n \nHelicopter Training.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s realignment of $142 \nmillion in Army O&M funding as part of the Administration\u2019s initiative to add $500 million to \nincrease our military\u2019s helicopter capacity.  This initiative is especially key to sustaining progress \nin Afghanistan. \n \nAfghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF).  The Administration opposes the reduction of $900 \nmillion for ASFF sustainment.  Accelerating the growth in size and capability of the Afghanistan \nNational Security Forces is a key component of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan.  The President\u2019s \nfull request reflects his commanders\u2019 plan for Afghan forces to assume a greater share of \nresponsibility for security as quickly as possible. \n \nSecurity and Stabilization Assistance (Section 1207).  The Administration urges that funding is \nprovided as requested for section 1207 reconstruction stabilization assistance. \n \nAlaska Territorial Guard.  The Administration objects to a new General Provision that would \ncount as \u201cactive duty\u201d service the time Alaska Territorial Guard members served during World \n2  War II.  This provision would establish a precedent of treating service performed by a State \nemployee as active duty for purposes of the computation of retired pay.  \n \nFunding in Advance of Need.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s funding for the \nPresident\u2019s $9.3 billion request for missile defense programs.  However, the Administration \nopposes the addition of $41 million for long-lead procurement of the next TPY-2 radar because the \nfunding is well in advance of need and would incrementally fund a capability that should be fully \nfunded in future budgets.  \n \nClassified Programs.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for \nclassified activities, including cyber security.  However, the Administration has significant \nconcerns with some of the Committee\u2019s reductions, particularly to certain compartmented \nprograms, including the \u201cConnect the Centers\u201d cyber security initiative, and the Business \nTransformation Office.  The details of these concerns will be provided under separate cover.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nSeptember 15, 2009 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n  H.R. 3221 \u2014 Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009 \n  (Rep. Miller, D-California, and 41 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3221, the Student Aid and Fiscal \nResponsibility Act of 2009.  The Administration is pleased that the bill will make key investments \nin college affordability and education reform, eliminate wasteful subsidies to financial institutions, \nand save taxpayers money.  The bill takes critical steps toward achieving the President\u2019s goal of \nrestoring the United States to first in the world in college completion by 2020. \n \nThe Administration supports the bill\u2019s reforms that would stabilize student loan programs using \nproven, private-sector practices.  Federally guaranteed student loans provide banks and other \nlenders with large profits that are set by the legislative process.  Under H.R. 3221, the use of the \nDirect Loan program would eliminate this process and serve students with essentially the same \nterms and conditions, but at much lower cost for taxpayers.  Students and taxpayers would no \nlonger be subjected to uncertainty when there is turmoil in the financial markets.  The Direct Loan \nprogram would use lower-cost Federal capital, and the Department of Education would hire \nnonprofits and private companies, selected through a competitive contracting process, to provide \nthe best services for students at the lowest cost for taxpayers.  For the sake of taxpayers as well as \nstudents, entities providing student loan services should be selected based on performance and \ncost. \n \nThe Administration is pleased that H.R. 3221 would use the savings from these reforms to make \nkey investments in providing Americans the skills they need to compete for 21st century jobs.  The \nAdministration strongly supports the bill\u2019s provision of additional funding that would support \ngrowth in the Pell Grant program, the cornerstone of the Nation\u2019s efforts to make sure that all \nAmericans can afford college.  The Administration supports the bill\u2019s simplification of the Free \nApplication for Federal Student Aid, eliminating unnecessary questions that act as obstacles for \naspiring college students.  The Administration is also pleased that the bill would establish a new \nCollege Access and Completion Innovation Fund to develop, implement, and evaluate new \napproaches to improving college success and completion, particularly for students from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds. \n \nThe Administration strongly supports the bill\u2019s inclusion of the President\u2019s American Graduation \nInitiative to usher in new innovations and reforms for our Nation\u2019s community colleges.   \nH.R. 3221 would support the President\u2019s call for an additional five million community college \ngraduates, including students who earn or go on to earn degrees, certificates, or industry-\nrecognized credentials, by 2020 by funding innovative strategies for building partnerships with \nemployers and the workforce investment system, reforming developmental education, linking \ncommunity colleges and high schools, and providing students with personalized academic and \ncounseling services.  The bill also would provide $2.5 billion in grants to leverage private-sector  financing for an estimated total of $10 billion in investments to modernize community college \nfacilities so that they meet employer and student needs.  The bill also would include funding for \nthe development and dissemination of high-quality, freely available online training and courses. \n \nThe Administration also strongly supports H.R. 3221\u2019s creation of the President\u2019s proposed Early \nLearning Challenge Fund.  Empirical studies have shown that investing in high-quality early \nlearning provides several dollars in return for every dollar invested.  Unfortunately, the quality of \nearly learning settings varies greatly and, despite some progress, early learning programs are held \nto inconsistent standards.  Reforms geared toward strengthening quality and improving educational \noutcomes across all settings are critically needed.  This program would challenge States to develop \nmodel systems of early learning, which incorporate a statewide infrastructure of integrated early \nlearning support and services for children from birth through age five.  In order to compete for an \naward under this program, States would commit to reforming essential components of their early \nlearning system, including establishing a high standard of quality across programs; increasing \nparticipation of disadvantaged children in comprehensive, high-quality early learning programs; \nfocusing new and existing programs on improving child learning and outcomes; and creating \nprogram rating, monitoring, and professional development systems so that more children are \nprepared to succeed in kindergarten. \n \nThe bill also includes an expanded and modernized Federal Perkins Loan Program that can help to \nreduce students\u2019 need for private and other non-Federal loans that often carry high interest rates \nand lack consumer protections.  The amended Perkins Loan Program would retain a low interest \nrate while allowing financial aid officers at colleges across the country the flexibility to provide \nadditional assistance to those students who need extra funds to complete their education.   \n \nAs this bill continues through the legislative process, the Administration would welcome \nimprovements.  In addition to the critical support for Pell Grants already in the bill, the \nAdministration would support further measures to strengthen the Pell Grant program.  Loan \nservicing provisions should be refined to minimize unnecessary costs.  The Administration asks \nthe Congress to strengthen accountability and transparency for institutions voluntarily choosing to \nparticipate in the College Access and Completion Innovation Fund, and to increase the share of the \nFund set aside for evaluation.  Finally, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the full \n$10 billion requested for the Early Learning Challenge Fund, and $12 billion for the American \nGraduation Initiative for community colleges. \n \nThe Administration commends the Congress for its commitment to making education a national \npriority.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to strengthen \nthis vital legislation. \n \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                             \n                                                                                                                          April 1, 2009 \n    (House)   \n \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \n \nH.R. 1256 \u2013 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act \n(Rep.

Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United \nStates and is a contributing factor to scores of diseases and conditions inflicting misery upon \nmillions of our citizens.  Further, tobacco use is a major factor driving the increasing costs of \nhealth care in the U.S. and accounts for over a hundred billion dollars annually in financial costs \nto the economy.    \n \nUnder the bill, the FDA would be responsible for setting standards for the manufacture of \ntobacco products as well as regulating the identity and amount of ingredients used in tobacco \nproducts.  Further, the bill would increase the protections for adolescents by strengthening the \nprohibition on advertising and access of tobacco products to young people.  These provisions \nand many others in this bill will together yield major benefits to the public health. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress to further refine the legislation on \nany issues of potential concern.   \n \n \n* * * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                             \nJune 23, 2009 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2892 \u2013 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 \n(Rep. Obey, D-Wisconsin)  \n \nThe Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 2892, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010. \n \nAs we face difficult economic and fiscal decisions, it is important to make efficient and effective \ninvestments.  The bill, as considered by the Committee, makes important investments in \ntransportation systems, cyber security, security for our borders, and emergency response.  This \nlegislation serves as an important piece of the Nation\u2019s economic recovery. \n  \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nE-Verify \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s continued support for E-Verify, a critical \ncomponent of immigration enforcement, including reauthorization of the program. \n \nLoran-C Termination \n \nThe Administration is very concerned with the Committee\u2019s recommendation to continue \noperation of the Coast Guard\u2019s antiquated radio navigation system, Loran-C, at an annual cost of \nover $36 million.  The decision to continue operating a program that serves limited Federal \ninterest deprives the Coast Guard of military personnel and resources to address its pressing \npriorities.  The Nation no longer needs this system because the federally supported civilian \nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) has replaced it with superior capabilities.  As a result, Loran-\nC, including recent limited technological enhancements, serves only a small group of long-time \nusers.  The termination plan for Loran-C system includes the preservation of high value \nequipment and measures to secure the sites until there is a decision about future use of the \nproperty.  The timing of Loran-C termination activities does not adversely impact the process \nunderway at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to evaluate the requirements for a \nGPS backup capability nor does it weaken any evaluation of eLoran, the latest in the long-\nstanding series of loran systems designed to expand the utility of existing Loran-C by expanding \ncoverage to the interior of the United States and upgrading the accuracy of the timing capability. \nFurther, the Administration is concerned that the Committee\u2019s direction to the Coast Guard to \nprovide a plan within 30 days for construction of an eLoran system bypasses DHS\u2019 acquisition \nprocess by foreclosing the analysis of alternatives. \n  Disaster Relief Fund \n \nThe Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funds the Disaster Relief Fund. \n \nFederal Protection Service (FPS) \n \nThe Administration is concerned that the Committee does not recommend the transfer of FPS \nfrom Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the National Protection Programs Directorate, as \nrequested.  The proposed realignment would provide DHS with a unitary component that would \nboth establish building security policy and ensure compliance.  The Administration understands \nthat an actionable plan is necessary for such a significant transfer.  DHS has been assembling a \ndetailed transition plan to support this transfer and will provide the Congress with these \nmaterials when they are finalized. \n \nFEMA Pre-Disaster Mitigation Funds and Emergency Operations Center Grant Program \n \nThe Administration appreciates the funding provided for the National Pre-Disaster Mitigation \nFund.  However, the Administration believes that DHS needs the flexibility to use risk \nassessment to guide its resource allocation.  Because these programs are intended to improve \npreparedness and response capabilities in our most vulnerable areas, it is critical that funding be \nallocated through a risk-management framework. \n \nCyber Security \n \nThe Administration is concerned about the level of funding for the National Cyber Security \nDivision (NCSD).  Funding requested for Cyber Security Coordination is necessary to provide \nNCSD with more advanced information sharing and collaboration tools to assist the Federal \ncivilian agencies with protecting their networks.  Additionally, the bill contains several \nprovisions that undermine risk-based funding determinations necessary to achieve the \nAdministration\u2019s recently announced cyber security goals and priorities. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n2  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n    June 08, 2010  \n    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5072 \u2013 FHA Reform Act of 2010 \n (Rep.

The President has put \nforward a plan to increase funding for the VA by $25 billion over the next five years, honoring \nveterans\u2019 service by providing more generous funding for their health care.  The President also \nwould create Centers of Excellence for VA medical care, with specialty services in areas like \nprosthetics, vision, spinal cord injury, aging, and women\u2019s health.  Importantly, the President \nbelieves that the VA must be better prepared to care for the veterans of current conflicts with \nspecial focus on mental health screening and treatment for conditions such as post-traumatic \nstress disorder and traumatic brain injury.  The VA will provide better outreach in rural areas \nwith new Vet Centers and mobile health clinics.  \n \nThe legislation, as considered by the Committee, rises to the President\u2019s challenge.  It invests \ncritical new dollars in programs that will significantly improve the quality of care and services \nfor our Nation\u2019s veterans.  Millions of patients, including more than 419,000 veterans of the \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan, will receive medical treatment as a result of these \ninvestments.  The legislation takes important steps forward to support the Administration\u2019s \nefforts to transform the VA into an agile, adaptive organization that is responsive to the changing \nneeds of the veterans community.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nMilitary Construction \n \nThe Administration appreciates the overall level of funding provided for military construction \nprojects.  However, the Administration is concerned that the bill funds several of these projects \nincrementally, including a critical National Security Agency facility.  Consistent with the \nPresident\u2019s Budget, the Administration encourages full funding of these programs to make the \nmost efficient use of taxpayer resources. \n \n  Guam Relocation \n \nThe Administration is concerned with the $211 million reduction in military construction funding \nrelated to the Marines realignment from Japan to Guam.  This level of reduction will adversely \nimpact the agreement reached between the United States and Japan in February 2009.   \n \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support to VA and for providing advance \nappropriations for VA\u2019s Medical Care accounts so that veterans will always be provided, without \ninterruption, the timely, accessible, and high-quality medical care they deserve. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSection 113 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch, \nwithout discretion, to notify the Congress 30 days in advance of certain military exercises, in \nwhich case it would intrude on the President\u2019s discharge of his constitutional authorities and \nduties to protect national security.  As a means of avoiding any constitutional difficulty, the \nAdministration recommends revising section 113 to make explicit that 30 days advance notice to \nthe Congress is required where feasible and consistent with the President\u2019s constitutional \nresponsibilities to protect national security. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nSeptember 29, 2010 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS.J.

This \nresolution is an attempt to put insurance companies back in charge of Americans' health care by \nallowing them to dramatically reduce benefits and increase costs while evading the new \nprotections that the Affordable Care Act provides to consumers. \n \nBy  dismantling the Interim Final Rule that set out the conditions under which health plans can \nqualify for \"grandfather\" status, the resolution would limit individuals' and businesses' choice to \nkeep the plan they had in place when the Affordable Care Act was enacted.  Adoption of the \njoint resolution would result in significant uncertainty as to what kind of changes may be made \nto coverage without a loss of grandfather status.  If S.J. Res. 39 were approved, it could be \nargued that any change in coverage could be made while retaining grandfather status, creating \nconfusion about which plans are actually grandfathered and stripping consumers of additional \nbenefits and protections.   \n  \nThe Interim Final Rule provides guidance that is essential for businesses, individuals, and issuers \nto determine when health coverage has changed to the point that it can no longer be regarded as \nthe grandfathered plan in effect on the date of enactment.  In specifying what changes can be \nmade without the loss of grandfather status, the Interim Final Rule strikes a careful balance \nbetween the goals of the Affordable Care Act of providing new patient protections while \nminimizing disruption in existing markets.  It achieves these goals by allowing businesses and \nhealth insurance issuers flexibility to make the kinds of normal adjustments they have \nhistorically made to contain costs and innovate.  The Interim Final Rule ensures that if \nindividuals or businesses choose to change their health coverage so significantly that it is no \nlonger the coverage in place on March 23, the plan will need to provide additional consumer \nprotections required by the Affordable Care Act, such as preventive health benefits without out-\nof-pocket costs and the right to independent appeals of health plan coverage determinations and \nclaims.  Moreover, the regulators are considering potential specific improvements to and \nclarifications of the Interim Final Rule in order to be responsive to stakeholders' comments on \nparticular aspects of the rule while continuing to meet issuers', employers' and families' needs for \nclear guidance. \n \nS.J. Res. 39 would replace the clarity of a reasoned set of rules for maintaining grandfather status \nwith confusion and uncertainty that will be disruptive for both employers and their workers and \nfamilies and result in unnecessary litigation.  The Administration estimates that 145 million \nAmericans with employer-sponsored health insurance\u2014who make up the vast majority of those \nwith private health insurance today\u2014will be in grandfathered health plans.  Further, the  Administration estimates that 70 percent of small business health plans will be grandfathered in \n2011.  To help sustain and promote small business coverage, the Affordable Care Act includes a \ntax credit for small businesses of up to 35 percent of their premium contributions for employees \nstarting in 2010.  \n \nThe Affordable Care Act supports Americans' ability to maintain their current health plan if they \nlike it and if an employer continues to offer it without significant changes.  Under the legislation, \nindividuals are guaranteed new benefits and protections if their plan is significantly changed or if \nthey lose their plan or select a new plan.  S.J. Res. 39 would dismantle this balance and would \nundermine key provisions of the Affordable Care Act that preserve market stability and \nflexibility and enhance consumer protections for businesses, health plans and individuals.  If the \nPresident is presented with a Resolution of Disapproval, his senior advisors would recommend \nthat he veto the Resolution. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nJuly 15, 2009 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n  S. 1390 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 \n(Sen. Levin, D-Michigan, and Sen. McCain, R-Arizona) \n \nThe Administration supports Senate passage of S. 1390, the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2010.  The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s \ncontinued strong support of our national defense, including its support for the Department\u2019s \ntopline budget requests for both the base budget and for overseas contingency operations. \n \nThe Administration appreciates, among other things, the leadership of the Committee in supporting \nmany of the President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have troubled histories or \nthat failed to demonstrate adequate performance when compared to other programs and activities \nneeded to carry out U.S. national security objectives.  In addition, the Administration appreciates \nthat the Committee included some authorities that are important to field and combatant \ncommanders, such as the Commanders\u2019 Emergency Response Program, the Security and \nStabilization Assistance program, and the extension of Contingency Construction Authority.   \n \nThe Administration believes that the Committee has identified many of the key elements that need \nto be changed in the existing law with respect to military commissions in order to make the \ncommissions an effective and fair system of justice, and looks forward to continuing its close \ncooperation with the Congress to further refine any issues of potential concern. \n \nWhile there are many areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration nonetheless has \nserious concerns with a number of provisions that could constrain the ability of the Armed Forces \nto carry out their missions, depart from the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2010 Budget, which carefully \nbalanced fiscal constraints, program performance, strategic needs and capabilities, or raise other \nissues.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns, \nsome of which are outlined below, and to refine this legislation to align it more closely with \nnational defense priorities. \n \nF-22 Procurement:  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions in the bill authorizing \n$1.75 billion for seven F-22s in FY 2010.  The collective judgment of the Service Chiefs and \nSecretaries of the military departments determined that a final program of record of 187 F-22s is \nsufficient to meet operational requirements.  As the President wrote in his letter to the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee on July 13, if the final bill \npresented to him contains this provision, the President will veto it.   \n \nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program:  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of \n$438.9 million for development of the alternative engine program.  The Administration also \nobjects to provisions of the bill that mandate an alternative engine program for the JSF.  The \ncurrent engine is performing well with more than 11,000 test hours.  In addition, the risks  associated with a single engine provider are manageable as evidenced by the performance of the F-\n22 and F/A-18E/F, Air Force and Navy programs supplied by a single engine provider.  \nExpenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and impede the progress of the overall JSF \nprogram.  The Air Force currently has several fleets that operate on a single-engine source.  The \nAdministration also objects to the limit on the obligation of overall JSF development funding to 90 \npercent of the amount authorized until the Secretary of Defense submits a written certification that \nsufficient funds have been obligated in FY 2010 for the alternative engine program.  If the final \nbill presented to the President would seriously disrupt the F-35 program, the President\u2019s senior \nadvisors would recommend a veto.   \n \nInterrogation Duties:  The Administration objects to section 823 in its current form, which would \nprohibit contractor personnel from interrogating persons detained during or in the aftermath of \nhostilities under any circumstances.  In some limited cases, a contract interrogator may possess the \nbest combination of skills to obtain critical intelligence and this provision, therefore, could prevent \nU.S. Forces from conducting lawful interrogations in the most effective manner.  The \nAdministration fully supports the application of ordinary Defense Department rules and \nregulations to contractors engaged in interrogations (as contemplated in subsection (a)(2) of the \ncurrent section 823), and could support a revised version of the section that would apply such \nprovisions to contractors who participate in interrogations.  The Administration also would object \nto any amendment requiring video recording of all intelligence interrogations.  Although the \nAdministration is open to studying a possible video recording requirement, implementing a \nmandatory requirement at this time would be imprudent, unduly burdensome, and could risk \nsignificant unintended consequences in current and future military operations. \n \nPakistan Counterinsurgency Fund:  The Administration objects to the requirement in section \n1517(a)(2) for a report to Congress prior to use of the funds.  This reporting and determination \nrequirement (which includes matters that may be beyond the Secretary of Defense\u2019s purview) \nwould delay the release of vital funds for Pakistan\u2019s counterinsurgency efforts.  It also duplicates \nother reporting requirements in section 1116 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 \n(Public Law 111-32), which require extensive justification and are due at a later date.   \n \nBuilding Partnership Capacity:  The Administration urges the inclusion of its proposals to build \nthe capacity of partner-nation special and conventional forces in order to enhance and increase \ncoalition participation in Afghanistan and Iraq.  These initiatives will directly reduce the pressure \non U.S. forces.  These limited, one-year proposals, developed in close partnership with the \nDepartment of State, are necessary for timely implementation of the Administration\u2019s new \nAfghanistan policy.  Without these authorities, the United States would lose precious time in \nincreasing the capacity and participation of our partners in that conflict and put additional U.S. \npersonnel at risk.   \n \nFuture Combat Systems:  The Administration objects to the removal of $324 million for Future \nCombat Systems (FCS) Manned Ground Vehicles and $58 million for Non-Line of Sight Cannon \ntermination costs.  The termination costs for FCS Manned Ground Vehicles cannot be fully paid \nwith FY 2009 funds. \n \nStrategic Airlift Force Levels:  The Administration objects to provisions in the bill that prohibit \nretirement of strategic airlift aircraft.  The Department assesses aircraft requirement based on \ncapability, not aircraft numbers.  A restriction not tied to an airlift requirement will drive \nunnecessary costs and reduce the efficiency of the overall fleet.  The restriction impairs the \n2  Department\u2019s ability to manage the fleet and respond to combatant commanders\u2019 request for \nforces. \n \nJoint Tactical Ground Station:  The Administration objects to the deletion of funding for the Joint \nTactical Ground Station (JTAGS) program.  JTAGS is essential to the warfighters because it \nsupports simultaneous operations in multiple theaters and provides a direct downlink for in-theater, \nassured missile warning to global and regional combatant commanders.  Four units are \npermanently forward-stationed on overseas locations and serve as the primary means for \ntransmitting missile warning to U.S. Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines. \n \nGuam Realignment:  The Administration objects to the $211 million reduction for Navy \nconstruction on Guam.  The Government of Japan has demonstrated its commitment to the \nRealignment Roadmap and Guam International Agreement by appropriating $336 million to \ntransfer to the United States to help fund Guam development in Japan\u2019s current fiscal year.  Failure \nof the Congress to provide a comparable amount for FY 2010 will place Japan\u2019s $6 billion \nfinancial commitment to Guam at high risk.  Furthermore, reductions to the program will increase \nthe U.S. total cost of the realignment.  The Administration looks forward to working with the \nCongress to provide additional details on program implementation to address concerns identified \nin the report. \n \nDeputy Under Secretaries of Defense and Assistant Secretaries of Defense:  The Administration \nhas significant concerns with this provision as currently written.  The elimination of non-statutory \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense positions in section 901 would be detrimental to the continuity \nand operation of the Department and severely hamper the Secretary of Defense\u2019s ability to \neffectively organize, structure, and manage the Department. \n \nNational Security Personnel System:  Although the Administration appreciates that S. 1390 \nprovides the Secretary the opportunity to complete the program review and make informed \ndecisions about the future of the program, the Administration objects to section 1101 because \nlegislative action on the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) is premature given the \nongoing review by DoD and the Office of Personnel Management.   \n \nConstitutional Concerns:  Several provisions of the bill (sections 244, 341 and 1221) are phrased \nin a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch to disclose information about \nongoing diplomatic negotiations or certain sensitive national security information, in which case \nthey would intrude on the President\u2019s discharge of his constitutional authorities.    \n \nImagery Satellite:  The Administration has concerns with the Committee\u2019s approach to the \nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2019s imagery satellite acquisition program.   \n \nFull Funding:  The Administration is concerned that S. 1390 authorizes incremental funding of \nmilitary construction projects.  As a matter of fiscal prudence, the Administration encourages full \nfunding of these programs, consistent with the President\u2019s Budget. \n \n* * * * * * * \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJuly 29, 2010 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n     \n  H.R. 3534 \u2212Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act of 2010 \n  (Rep. Rahall, D\u2212West Virginia) \n \nThe President has called for both administrative and legislative action to:  (1) improve the safety \nof offshore drilling; (2) guarantee that those who are responsible for damages from an oil spill as \na result of offshore drilling fully compensate those who have borne the cost of those damages; \nand (3) eliminate the conflicts of interest that have put industry profits ahead of the safety of \nworkers and the natural environment, as was recently demonstrated in the Gulf of Mexico.  The \nAdministration commends the House Committees on Natural Resources, Transportation and \nInfrastructure, and Energy and Commerce for their efforts in developing this legislation, which \ncreates a framework to accomplish these goals.  The Administration strongly supports House \npassage of H.R. 3534. \n \nH.R. 3534, which is largely consistent with the Administration's vision of dividing the key \nresponsibilities for offshore energy management into three distinct entities within the \nDepartment of the Interior, contains the necessary authorities for these three entities.  The \nAdministration believes that it would be most effective if this reorganization focused exclusively \non Outer Continental Shelf resources at this time. \n \nH.R. 3534 would provide additional authorities to promote enhanced health and environmental \nsafety standards for offshore operations, strengthen environmental reviews of offshore drilling \nplans, reform revenue collection, and implement a more extensive system of inspections of \noffshore energy activities.  These standards will improve safety, and removing the arbitrary limit \non liability for damages caused by offshore drilling will create the incentive for the oil and gas \nindustry to comply with new standards and seek out and implement best practices for safety.  \nThe Administration strongly supports the repeal of the limit on economic damages liability for \noffshore drilling, which has served as an implicit subsidy for the oil and gas industry for two \ndecades.  The Administration likewise supports the repeal of industry subsidies granted in the \nform of \u201croyalty relief.\u201d The Administration also supports efforts that respect the authority of the \nDepartment of the Interior to oversee and regulate offshore drilling, including the need for a \ntemporary suspension of operations necessary to improve safety, well containment methods, and \nspill response capacity in the Gulf of Mexico. \n \nThe Administration has concerns with provisions relating to the Exclusive Economic Zone with \nrespect to U.S. obligations under international trade and investment agreements.  The \nAdministration strongly supports funding for land and water conservation and historic \npreservation projects that prioritize the needs of the Nation based on competitive processes.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with Congress to improve the bill as it proceeds \nthrough the legislative process.  \n \n* * * * * * *   ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nJuly 28, 2009 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3326 \u2014 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010 \n(Rep. Obey, D-Wisconsin) \n \nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3326, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010. \n \nThe Administration is committed to keeping the United States military the strongest and most \ncapable military in the world.  The President\u2019s strategy increases training, resources, and support \nfor the U.S. Armed Forces.  To keep the United States secure, the Armed Forces must have \nsufficient resources to prevail in current operations while maintaining and developing new \ncapabilities to deter potential adversaries and prepare for other risks and contingencies.  This \nlegislation, as approved by the House Committee on Appropriations, advances many initiatives in \nline with the President\u2019s goals. \n \nThe President and the Nation\u2019s military leadership have put forward a strategy for Afghanistan and \nPakistan so that all elements of national power are engaged and integrated in an effort to defeat al \nQaeda and prevent attacks on the homeland and on U.S. allies and partners.  In Iraq, the United \nStates is moving forward with a responsible drawdown of combat forces, having transferred \nsecurity responsibilities to Iraq\u2019s forces.  The legislation, as approved by the Committee, provides \ncritical resources to enable this to happen. \n \nThe Administration also recognized the importance of requesting a full year\u2019s resources for these \noperations.  Providing full-year funding will give troops carrying out operations overseas the \nability to plan operations more effectively and will cause far less disruption in other base \nprograms. By providing a full year\u2019s funding up front for these operations, the Committee follows \nthrough on the President\u2019s request, and ends the disruptions caused by relying on supplemental \nfunding.   \n \nProviding greater support for servicemembers and their families is a top priority for the President \nand the Department of Defense (DOD).  This includes increasing the size of the Army and Marine \nCorps to reduce the strain on military families, and additional help to put an end to stop loss.  It \nalso includes easing the burdens on U.S. troops and their families with increased pay, quality child \ncare, job training for spouses, and expanded counseling and outreach to families that have \nexperienced the separation and stress of war.  The legislation builds on the progress in the Fiscal \nYear 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act with necessary resources to meet these commitments. \n \nThe President has also requested significant new resources for military medical care, with \nadditional Army wounded warrior complexes and increased resources to address traumatic brain \ninjuries and mental health needs.  The Committee legislation meets the President\u2019s goals with \nfunding that advances first-class medical care for servicemembers and their families.   \nThe Administration believes that, while the Committee has made important investments in the \nNation\u2019s defense, there are significant ways in which the current bill can be strengthened and looks \nforward to working with the Congress on this effort. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nF-22 Fighter.  The Administration strongly objects to $369 million in unrequested advanced \nprocurement funding provided for 12 F-22 fighter aircraft in FY 2011, rather than ending the \nproduction program as requested by the President.  The collective judgment of the Service Chiefs \nand Secretaries of the military departments has determined that 187 F-22s are sufficient to meet \noperational requirements.  Consistent with the President\u2019s letter to the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Senate Armed Services Committee on July 13, 2009, concerning the National \nDefense Authorization Act, if the final bill presented to him contains this provision, the President \nwill veto it.   \n \nJoint Strike Fighter (F-35) Alternate Engine.  The Administration strongly objects to the addition \nof $130 million to produce, and $430 million to continue the development of, the Joint Strike \nFighter (JSF) alternate engine, which was proposed for termination by the President.  Expenditures \non an alternate engine for the JSF are unnecessary and divert resources from the overall JSF \nprogram.  The current engine is performing well, and the risks associated with a single engine \nprovider are manageable.  If the final bill presented to the President would seriously disrupt the F-\n35 program, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \nPresidential Helicopter (VH-71).  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $400 \nmillion to make operational five partially-completed VH-71 helicopters.  These helicopters \ncurrently have no mission equipment and would require in excess of $2 billion to complete and to \noperate as Presidential helicopters, yet would still not meet full operational requirements for that \nmission.  DOD and the White House are conducting a requirements analysis, and the outcome of \nthis effort should not be pre-empted.  If the final bill were to include funds that continue the \nexisting VH-71 program, or would prejudge the plan to re-compete the Presidential helicopter \nprogram, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   \n \nC-17 Transport Aircraft.  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $674 million in \nfunding for three unrequested C-17 airlift aircraft.  Analyses by DOD have shown that the 205 C-\n17s in the force and on order, together with the existing fleet of C-5 aircraft, are sufficient to meet \nthe Department\u2019s future airlift needs, even under the most stressing situations.   \n \nEfficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the \nPresident\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that fund narrowly focused activities, \nduplicate existing programs, or that have outlived their usefulness, specifically including the \nKinetic Energy Interceptor program.  The Congress is encouraged to adopt proposals made by the \nAdministration that would better target scarce resources and redirect funds to programs with \ngreater potential for results. \n \nTanker Acquisition.  Although the Administration appreciates that the Committee funds the Tanker \nReplacement Transfer Fund, the Administration strongly opposes language that hinders DOD\u2019s \nability to ensure a fair and timely competition and restricts the assembly of all non-developmental \n2  aircraft in a manner that is inconsistent with our international agreements.  The Administration \nsupports a procurement approach that takes advantage of the efficiencies associated with an award \nto a single contractor.  \n \nMine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles.  The Administration strongly urges full \nfunding for MRAPs and opposes the reduction of $1.9 billion from the request.  Since the \nPresident\u2019s FY 2010 request was transmitted, the military\u2019s requirement for MRAPs has increased \nfrom 2,080 to 5,244.  The Committee\u2019s reduction would seriously delay fulfillment of this \nrequirement.  \n \nMissile Defense Agency Rescissions.  The Administration opposes the rescission of 2009 funds for \nthe European Interceptor Site because this would remove the Administration\u2019s flexibility to arrive \nat a future decision on ballistic missile defense in Europe.  The Administration also objects to the \nrescission of 2009 funds for the Space Tracking and Surveillance System, which would result in \nimmediate cessation of work and deobligation of funds.   \n \nSecurity and Stabilization Assistance (Section 1207).  The Administration urges that authority for \nthe section 1207 reconstruction stabilization assistance be funded as requested. \n \nClassified Programs.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address \nconcerns regarding statutory direction to re-organize certain offices within the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence (ODNI), reductions to cyber security programs, and cuts to \nclassified activities in ODNI.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n3  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMarch 19, 2010 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3590 \u2013 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  \nand \nH.R. 4872 \u2013 Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of health insurance reform legislation.  This \nlegislation makes significant improvements that will help to give American families and small \nbusiness owners more control of their own health care.  It makes important changes \u2013 ending the \nworst practices of insurance companies; giving uninsured individuals and small business owners \nthe same kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress have; and bringing \ndown the cost of health care for families and businesses while also reducing Federal budget \ndeficits.  \n \nThis legislation provides the necessary health reforms that the Administration seeks \u2013 affordable, \nquality care within reach for the tens of millions of Americans who do not have it today by \nproviding the largest tax cut for health care in history and prohibiting insurance companies from \ndenying coverage to the millions of Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.  It also \nbrings new stability and security for the hundreds of millions who already have insurance by \nreining in the worst insurance industry abuses and putting in place reforms that increase \ntransparency, improve the quality of care, and contain health care costs.  This legislation \ncontributes to transforming the health care system to make health care more accessible and \naffordable for the American people.  It also includes provisions that would eliminate wasteful \nsubsidies for student loan lenders and invest these savings to fortify the Pell Grant program and \nincrease Pell Grants for millions of students; strengthen community colleges; strengthen \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority-Serving Institutions; and allow \nstudents to cap student loan payments at affordable levels.

Providing facilities to support the men and women in our armed \nforces and benefits to take care of those who have served is a priority of the Administration.    \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nMilitary Construction \n \nThe Administration appreciates the overall level of funding provided by the Committee for \nmilitary construction  but is concerned with the use of incremental funding for the following \nprojects: Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, Wiesbaden, Germany; Finegayan Site \nPrep and Utilities, Guam; and the Air Force Technical Applications Center, Patrick Air Force \nBase, Florida.  The Administration encourages full funding of these programs to make the most \nefficient use of taxpayer resources. \n \nGuam Realignment \n \nThe Administration is very concerned with the reduction of $273 million for Navy construction \non Guam.  To date, the government of Japan has demonstrated its commitment to support Guam \nrealignment efforts by appropriating $336 million for Guam development, and Japan is expected \nto provide an additional $498 million in the near future.  The U.S. Government\u2019s failure to \nprovide a comparable amount for fiscal year 2011 could place Japan\u2019s financial commitment to \nGuam at risk.  The Department of Defense (DOD) has worked closely with other Federal \nagencies to address concerns with the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. Final resolution of \nthese concerns codified in a Record of Decision, as required by the National Environmental \nPolicy Act, will allow DOD to move forward with construction.   \n \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the Department in order to \nprovide the timely and high-quality delivery of health care and benefits that veterans deserve. \n \n \n \n  Constitutional Concerns   \n \nSection 113 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch, \nwithout discretion, to notify the Congress 30 days in advance of certain military exercises, which \nwould intrude on the President\u2019s discharge of his constitutional authorities and duties to protect \nnational security.  The Administration recommends revising section 113 to make explicit that 30 \ndays\u2019 advance notice to the Congress is required where feasible and consistent with the \nPresident\u2019s constitutional responsibilities to protect national security. \n \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                             \n                                                                                                                        May 11, 2009 \n      (Senate) \n \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 627 - Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act of 2009 \n(Rep. Maloney (D) New York and 128 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute to H.R. 627 that it understands will be offered on the Senate floor by the Chair and \nRanking Member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.  The Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National \nCredit Union Administration have issued new rules that prohibit unfair credit card practices.  \nThe Administration supports Congress\u2019s efforts to codify these changes and provide additional \nstrong and reliable protections for consumers that ban unfair and abusive practices.   \n \nThe Nation\u2019s credit card system must have more accountability, including more effective \noversight and more effective enforcement of credit card issuers who violate the law.

The President has called on the \nCongress to enact far-reaching Wall Street reform legislation to overhaul the Nation\u2019s financial \nsystem in the wake of the recent financial crisis, setting forth clear objectives and principles that \nwere endorsed by congressional leaders.  Wall Street reform is critical to put in place rules that \nwill allow the Nation\u2019s markets to promote innovation while discouraging abuse, to create a \nframework in which markets can function freely and fairly without the fragility in which normal \nbusiness cycles bring the risk of financial collapse, and to provide a system that works for \nbusinesses and consumers. \n \nThe Administration commends the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee for \nits efforts in developing comprehensive Wall Street reform legislation.  The Administration also \ncommends the Senate Agriculture Committee for additional leadership on provisions related to \nderivatives.  Senate passage of S. 3217 \u2013 including derivatives provisions from the Agriculture \nand Banking Committees \u2013 will move the Nation another important step towards necessary, \ncomprehensive Wall Street reform that will create clear rules of the road and can be consistently \nand systematically enforced, thus creating a more stable financial system with better protection \nfor consumers and investors. \n  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve successful \ncomprehensive reform as S. 3217 continues to move through the legislative process.  The \nAdministration will oppose efforts to add loopholes to the bill that undermine consumer and \ninvestor protection or that allow institutions to avoid oversight.

The Administration commends the Senate for acting promptly to move \nbipartisan legislation that will expand high-quality service opportunities and position the \nCorporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) to support both growth and \nexcellence in the programs it oversees.  The Administration understands that the Senate will \nconsider a substitute for H.R. 1388 that is similar to the text of S. 277, the Serve America Act, \nsponsored by Senators Kennedy and Hatch.  The Administration strongly supports Senate \npassage of S. 277, which would move the process one step closer to the President's goal of \nsigning into law legislation that promotes civic participation and service. \n \nThe Administration is pleased that under S. 277, the Corporation would develop a plan to set the \nagency on a responsible path towards 250,000 members within eight years, subject to \nappropriations.  The Administration is committed to creating high-quality service opportunities \nthat allow Americans to serve their communities and help the Nation meet its most pressing \nchallenges. \n \nThe Administration applauds the bill's focus on service learning and provisions that would \nincrease the Eli Segal Education Award and link future increases in award amounts to the \nmaximum Pell Grant awards. \n \nThe Administration has called on Americans from all walks of life to take part in civic renewal, \nand is therefore pleased that S. 277 also would expand and improve service opportunities for \nseniors.  The Administration would like the bill to include the responsible and balanced \nintroduction of competition into the Senior Corps programs, which would better position the \nprogram for expansion.  Competition will improve the quality of service opportunities for seniors \nwhile introducing greater accountability and innovation. \n \nAs the Federal investment in national service programs increases, the Administration is \ncommitted to making the programs more accountable and cost-effective, and supports the many \nways in which S. 277 would foster this.  In particular, the Administration supports the bill's \nprovisions to consolidate funding in AmeriCorps, giving the Corporation flexibility to support \nthe best programs.  The Administration is pleased that the bill would expand authority for fixed-\namount grants that simplify reporting requirements, ease burdens on grantees, and strengthen \naccountability for performance. \n  The Administration is pleased that the bill includes the President's initiative to create \"Social \nInnovation Funds\" to provide seed money and scale up capital for innovative and evidence-based \nefforts in the nonprofit sector to address social problems, and for leveraging private and \nfoundation capital to meet major social challenges. \n \nS. 277 couples expanded and improved national service with the structural changes needed to \nsupport growth and produce excellent results for the participants and our Nation.

Obey, D-Wisconsin)  \nThe Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 2847, making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Commerce and Justice, and Science and Related Agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2010.   \n \nAs we face difficult economic and fiscal decisions, it is important to make efficient and effective \ninvestments.  The bill as considered by the Committee makes important investments in \ninnovation and job creation, community safety, and cutting-edge technologies.  This legislation \nserves as an important piece of the Nation\u2019s economic recovery and is consistent with the \nPresident\u2019s commitment to double the funding for basic research over ten years. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nAdministration Priorities  \n \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  The Administration is concerned with \nthe reduction of $670 million from the President\u2019s FY 2010 request for Exploration Systems.  \nThis large reduction would likely cause major negative impacts to any options that may emerge \nfrom the ongoing blue ribbon review of U.S. human space flight plans.  The Administration \nappreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the NASA Earth science program, which \nadvances the President\u2019s goal of deploying a global climate change research and monitoring \nsystem. The Administration is concerned with the elimination of $21 million from the request for \nNASA innovation, which uses public-private partnerships to advance important technologies and \nenable access to new sources of innovation through incentive prizes and partnerships. In \naddition, the Administration is concerned about funding NASA\u2019s R&D activities with primarily \none-year rather than two-year appropriations.  Such an action would increase the cost and \ncomplexity of budget execution and would diminish flexibility without improving management. \n \nNational Science Foundation (NSF).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support \nfor the President\u2019s goal of doubling the NSF budget as a key component of his Plan for Science \nInnovation.  However, the Committee\u2019s version of the bill is $108 million below the level \nrequested in the Budget, and this reduction will come at the expense of NSF\u2019s research activities \nand agency operations. \n \nDepartment of Commerce \n \nThe Administration appreciates the support the Committee provides for the 2010 Census, but  urges the Congress to provide the full request of $7.4 billion in new budget authority for the \nCensus Bureau.  The current bill effectively reduces the President\u2019s request by $206 million by \nrelying upon unobligated balances from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  This \nwould force the Census Bureau to reduce its contingency reserve, a key risk mitigation measure, \nby nearly one third.  \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s full funding for the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership Program and the Technology Innovation Program but urges the Congress to provide \nfull funding of the highest-priority research of the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST) as part of the President\u2019s Plan for Science and Innovation.  The bill \nunderfunds requested NIST research and construction activities by $85 million (13 percent); the \nbill includes $20 million of unrequested funding for construction grants that could be better spent \non highest-priority research.   \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of the Economic Development \nAdministration, but urges the Congress to support the Administration\u2019s request within this \nfunding to target $50 million to create a Business Incubator Network and $50 million to develop \nregional innovation clusters.  Both of these initiatives can help our Nation develop dynamic \nbusinesses and assist communities to respond effectively to challenging economic conditions. \n \nThe Congress is urged to provide full funding for the Department of Commerce\u2019s share of costs \nassociated with the renovation of the Herbert C. Hoover Building.  The House bill provides only \n$5 million out of the requested $22.5 million.  While most of the renovation costs will be \ncovered by the General Services Administration through Recovery Act funding, the Department \nis responsible for key aspects of the project\u2019s costs.  \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support of the important activities of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), including providing full funding \nfor NOAA satellites.  However, within this funding the Administration urges the Congress to \nprovide the additional $13 million requested to support accelerated improvement of hurricane \ntrack and intensity forecasts, which will help to prevent unnecessary and costly evacuations.   \n \nDepartment of Justice  \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the law enforcement, prosecutorial, \nincarceration and other requirements of the Department of Justice.  However, the Administration \nis concerned with the prescriptive nature of the additional $25 million provided for the FBI to \nestablish new task forces to combat violent crime.  The Attorney General, as the chief law \nenforcement officer, should maintain the flexibility to address violent crime, including gang \ncrime, in a manner that best utilizes Federal resources and leverages the unique role of the \nFederal Government. \n \nLegal Services Corporation (LSC) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the funding request for LSC and for \nthe elimination of the restriction on the collection of attorney\u2019s fees.  However, the \nAdministration is concerned that all citizens have access to legal representation and urges the \nCongress to also remove the riders which restrict the use of non-LSC funds by LSC grant \nrecipients and which prevent LSC lawyers from participating in class action law suits that \n2  typically seek injunctive relief for the benefit of all members of a class by stopping illegal \nactivity.  In contrast to private lawyers who bring class action lawsuits, legal aid lawyers do not \nreceive payment from clients and therefore do not stand to benefit from large \nmonetary settlements. \n \nConstitutional and Other Concerns \n \nThe Administration is concerned about provisions in the bill that could constrain the ability of \nthe President to conduct foreign affairs. In addition, the Administration is concerned about \nrestrictions on reprogramming of funds.  The Administration looks forward to working with \nCongress to address these concerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                             \n                                                                                                                        May 07, 2008 \n                                                                                                                        (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 454 - Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 \n(Sen.

The \nAdministration supports Congress\u2019s efforts to codify these changes and provide additional strong \nand reliable protections for consumers that ban unfair and abusive practices.  The Nation\u2019s credit \ncard system must have more accountability, including more effective oversight and more \neffective enforcement of credit card issuers who violate the law.

The \nCommittee bill also provides support for transit safety and the Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress to make certain that those resources best serve our common goal of \nmaking our systems as safe as possible. \nNational Infrastructure Innovation and Finance Fund.  The Administration encourages the \nCongress to provide funding to support the creation of a National Infrastructure Innovation and \nFinance Fund (I-Fund) and is committed to working with the Congress to enact authorizing \nlegislation.  The I-Fund introduces a new and innovative approach to competitive financing for \nprojects of regional and national significance and is designed to maximize partnership and co-\ninvestment from non-Federal partners.   \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nRental Assistance.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the President's \nrequest for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance, Project-Based Rental Assistance, and Public \nHousing programs.  This funding is especially important in light of the current economic \nenvironment.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested $350 million for \nthe Transforming Rental Assistance initiative to preserve public and assisted housing, enhance \nhousing choice for residents, and streamline the administration of HUD's rental assistance \nprograms.  The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to enact authorizing \nlegislation for this initiative. \n  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Catalytic Grants.  While the Administration \nappreciates the Committee's support to fully fund the CDBG formula program at $4 billion, the \nAdministration strongly urges the Congress to provide the requested $150 million for the new \nCatalytic Investment Competition Grants program.  These grants will bring innovative economic \ndevelopment projects to scale and will target meaningful investments for distressed communities.   \n \nChoice Neighborhoods.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested $250 \nmillion for Choice Neighborhoods, which would support the Administration's broader, place-\nbased effort to fight concentrated poverty and revitalize neighborhoods. \n \nHomeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the \nHomeless Assistance Grants as HUD prepares to implement the HEARTH Act and the Federal \nStrategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness. \n \nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) Premiums.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee's support for broader FHA authority to set annual premiums on mortgage insurance.  \nThis authority will allow FHA to more appropriately price single family mortgage insurance and \nis an essential component of FHA's efforts to rebuild its capital reserves and improve risk \nmanagement.  The Administration urges the Congress to further these efforts by enacting full \nFHA reform, as included in H.R. 5072, the \"FHA Reform Act of 2010\". \n \nEfficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration urges support of the President's \ninitiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their usefulness, fund narrowly \nfocused activities, or duplicate existing programs, including the elimination of the Brownfields \nEconomic Development Initiative and the reduction of the HOME Investment Partnerships \nProgram, as requested.     \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nJuly 27, 2009 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3183 \u2014 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies  \nAppropriations Act, 2010 \n(Sen.

These investments are designed to further solutions to \ncreate new industries and new opportunities for Americans for decades to come.  \n \nThis bill invests in the sciences, encouraging innovative technologies that will be central to the \nNation\u2019s energy independence.  The legislation makes long overdue commitments to improve \ninfrastructure, focusing on high-return investments and the reliable operation of those facilities \nthat are of central importance to the Nation.  Additionally, and importantly, the legislation follows \nthrough on the Nation\u2019s commitments to the Gulf Coast region, still recovering from historic \nstorms from years past, and works to prevent such devastation from future storms.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nAdministration Priorities  \n \nOffice of Science.  The Administration is concerned about the Committee\u2019s reduction to the \nDepartment of Energy\u2019s Office of Science, a key component of the President\u2019s Plan for Science \nand Innovation.  The Committee\u2019s level would not maintain the President\u2019s proposed path to \ndouble the funding for this office over 10 years.  \n \nEnergy Innovation Hubs and RE-ENERGYSE.  The Administration strongly opposes reductions in \nfunding for the Energy Innovation Hubs and RE-ENERGYSE.  The Hubs will advance highly \npromising areas of energy science and technology from their early states and RE-ENERGYSE will \nhelp develop the science and engineering workforce needed to bring those ideas to life by \nencouraging tens of thousands of American students to pursue careers in science, engineering, and \nentrepreneurship related to clean energy. \n \nElectricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.  The Administration is concerned with the \nCommittee\u2019s $35 million reduction to Smart Grid Research and Development.  \n  Efficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the \nPresident\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that fund narrowly focused activities, \nduplicate existing programs, or that have outlived their usefulness, such as Los Alamos Neutron \nScience Center, which was built 30 years ago and no longer plays a critical role in weapons \nresearch.  The Administration also encourages the Congress to reconsider the termination of \nactivities where industry has strong incentive to carry out its own research such as oil and gas \nresearch. \n \nDepartment of Energy \n \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Administration urges the Congress to \nfully fund the request for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The research, \ndevelopment, and demonstration of solar energy and building technologies are two areas where \ninvestments can make large contributions toward a clean energy economy.  \n \nOffice of Nuclear Energy.  The Administration is concerned with the Committee\u2019s reallocation of \nfunds among nuclear energy programs because it reduces the critical investment in longer-term \nresearch and development, undermining the goal of building a solid foundation for the long-term \nuse of safe and secure nuclear power. In addition, the Administration strongly urges the Congress \nto restore funding to re-establish a domestic Pu-238 production capability, which is essential to \nmake sure Pu-238 will be available when needed for planned NASA missions as well as future \nnational security applications. \n \nEnergy Information Administration.  The Administration urges the Congress to restore funds to \nallow the Energy Information Administration to undertake important energy analysis and statistical \nwork, such as gathering critical information on energy use and the performance of Federal energy \nefficiency programs and to improve the statistical reliability of home energy use data. \n \nOffice of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.  The Administration remains committed to \nmeeting the Federal Government\u2019s obligations for managing and ultimately disposing of spent \nnuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, and is establishing a Blue Ribbon Commission to \nevaluate options and make recommendations for a new plan for the back end of the fuel cycle.  All \nof the fees collected in the Nuclear Waste Fund are essential to meet those obligations. \n \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The Administration is concerned with the $28 \nmillion funding reduction to the Pantex Renewable Energy Project. The reduction would result in \ndelays to the first major NNSA renewable energy project in support of the Energy Policy Act goal \nof acquiring at least 7.5 percent of annual electricity from renewable sources by FY 2013. \n \nCorps of Engineers (Civil Works)  \n \nAquatic Ecosystem Restoration.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of \nthe South Florida ecosystem restoration program, the Congress is urged to restore funding for key \ninitiatives to make progress in restoring this diverse ecosystem and to increase water supply.  In \naddition, the Congress is urged to remove sections 115 and 116 of the bill, which would obstruct \ncompliance with a court order. \n \nFlood and Storm Damage Reduction.  The Administration urges the Congress to restore the \nrequested $41 million for a base annual level of funding needed to prepare for floods and other \n2  natural disasters in lieu of continuing to provide these funds through periodic supplemental \nappropriations.  The Congress is urged to restore the $2 million requested for the Water Resources \nPriorities study, a high-priority interagency evaluation of the Nation\u2019s vulnerability to flooding. \n \nReprogramming Provisions \n \nSections 101 and 201 of the bill contain restrictions on the reprogramming of funds that present \nsignificant management challenges for the Department of the Interior and the Corps of Engineers \nin the execution of their responsibilities.  The Congress is urged to adopt the President\u2019s proposal \nwith respect to these provisions.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                             \n  April 20, 2009 \n  (Senate) \n \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 386 -  Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 \n(Sen. Leahy (D) Vermont and 4 cosponsors) \n \n \nThe Administration strongly supports enactment of S. 386.  Its provisions would provide Federal \ninvestigators and prosecutors with significant new criminal and civil tools and resources that \nwould assist in holding accountable those who have committed financial fraud. \n \nSpecifically, the legislative enhancements would help the Department of Justice to combat \nmortgage fraud, securities and commodities fraud, money laundering and related offenses, and to \nprotect taxpayer money that has been expended on recent economic stimulus and rescue \npackages.  Further, the legislation would amend the False Claims Act (FCA) in several important \nrespects so that the FCA remains a potent and useful weapon against the misuse of taxpayer \nfunds.  In general, this legislation would benefit U.S. taxpayers by both addressing existing fraud \nand deterring waste, fraud, and abuse of public funds.  Moreover, S. 386 would provide needed \nresources to strained law enforcement agencies and prosecutors that would enable the \nDepartment and its partners to advance the pace and reach of the enforcement response to the \ncurrent economic crisis.  These additional resources will provide a return on investment through \nadditional fines, penalties, restitution, damages, and forfeitures.  With the tools and resources \nthat S. 386 provides, the Department of Justice and others would be better equipped to address \nthe challenges that face this Nation in difficult economic times and to do their part to help the \nNation respond to this challenge. \n \n*  *  *  *  *  * \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJuly 21, 2010 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \n H.R. 1264 \u2013 Multiple Peril Insurance Act of 2009 \n (Rep. Taylor, D-Mississippi, and 22 cosponsors)  \n \nThe Administration recognizes that the availability of hazard insurance is a key element in the \nability of individuals and communities to recover from disasters.  However, the Administration \nopposes House passage of H.R. 1264, which would expand the Federal Government\u2019s role to \nprovide windstorm insurance that is already readily available in the private sector and through \nState insurance plans without Federal aid.  Although the Administration believes in \nstrengthening the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for the benefit of policyholders and \ntaxpayers, the central rationale for the program \u2013 the difficulty of obtaining flood insurance \nthrough either the private market or State programs \u2013 simply does not apply to windstorm \ninsurance in most markets.  Moreover, because the legislation appropriately requires that a \nFederal wind insurance program be actuarially sound, the insurance offered through a Federal \nprogram may not be any less expensive, and could be more expensive, than what is currently \noffered by private insurers and/or by States.  As a result, expanding NFIP to cover windstorm \ninsurance would unnecessarily duplicate available insurance products and could \u201ccrowd out\u201d \nsuch products where they are offered, while offering little to no savings to the American public. \nAt a time when the NFIP is already facing serious challenges, the Administration cannot support \nsuch an expansion.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \n  July 7, 2009 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2892 \u2013 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010 \n(Senator Inouye, D-Hawaii)  \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 2892, with the committee-reported \ntext of S. 1298, making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2010. \n \nAs we face difficult economic and fiscal decisions, it is important to make efficient and effective \ninvestments.  The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010, as considered by \nthe Senate Committee, makes important investments in transportation systems, cyber security, \ninnovation and job creation, security for our borders, and emergency response.  This legislation \nserves as an important piece of the Nation\u2019s economic recovery. \n  \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nFederal Protection Service (FPS) \n \nThe Administration is pleased that the Committee supports the transfer of FPS to the National \nProtection and Programs Directorate (NPPD).  This transfer will properly align the activities of \nFPS and NPPD, while allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to focus on its key \nimmigration enforcement mission.  The Administration plans to provide additional details to the \nCongress in support of the FPS transition and realignment of these responsibilities in the next few \nweeks. \n \nE-Verify Extension \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee's support for E-Verify by fully funding the request \nand including a three-year reauthorization to continue operations.  This critical program supports \nimmigration enforcement and promotes compliance with immigration laws. \n \nFederal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA\u2019s) Disaster Relief Fund \n \nThe Committee significantly underfunds the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF).  In an effort to \nimplement a more transparent funding process for DRF, the Administration's $2 billion request is \nbased on a methodology that incorporates historical costs associated with FEMA's response for \nnon-catastrophic incidents. \n  Loran-C Termination \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee's support for termination of the Loran-C radio \nnavigation system.  The Administration supports the Committee's aim to achieve an orderly \ntermination through a phased decommissioning beginning in January 2010, and the requirement \nthat certifications be provided to document that the Loran-C termination will not impair maritime \nsafety or the development of possible GPS backup capabilities or needs. \n \nImmigration Services \n \nThe Congress is urged to provide the requested funding to reform immigration fees.  Eliminating \nthe practice of passing on costs for refugees and asylees to other applicants for immigration \nbenefits is an important first step to improve the accuracy, transparency, and fairness of \nimmigration fees. \n \nThe Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide additional resources to support and \nexpand successful immigrant integration programs across the country.   \n \n* * * * * * *  \n \n2  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  August 2, 2010 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n  Senate Amendment 4567 to H.R. 1586 - Teacher Jobs and State Fiscal Relief \n  (Sen.

The Administration strongly supports the \nextension of the temporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for \nsix months through June 2011, which will provide critical assistance to States to help them \nmaintain their Medicaid programs during a period of high enrollment growth and reduced State \nrevenue.  In addition, to provide this assistance in a fiscally responsible way, the amendment \nincludes revenue-raising provisions similar to those included in the President's Budget, including \nproposals to close international tax loopholes that currently allow multinational corporations to \ninappropriately lower their U.S. taxes. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  November 30, 2010 \n    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 3307 \u2013 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 \n(Sen.

The Administration commends the Committee for \nincluding the full request of $475 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to restore the \necology and environment of the Great Lakes.  The Administration also appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s increased support for the Water Security Initiative, but urges the Congress to fully \nfund the remaining two pilot projects.  The President\u2019s request would finish funding the \ncooperative agreements with the cities and allow EPA to transition to data analysis, dissemination \nof best practices, and close out of the program.  The lessons learned from these pilot projects \nwould provide all water systems nationwide with tools to effectively protect their critical water \ninfrastructure. \n \nWildland Fires.  The Administration appreciates the strong support of the Committee in providing \nrequested funding amounts for wildfire suppression operations and the new Wildland Fire \nSuppression Contingency Reserve of the Forest Service and Department of the Interior.

The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the \nPresident\u2019s initiative to expand health care services through the Indian Health Service. \n \nDepartment of the Interior \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for nearly all of the priorities identified  in the President\u2019s Budget.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the  \n$30 million increase requested for programs to help teach youth about conservation through \noutdoor activities, such as hunting and fishing.  The Administration is also concerned about \nefforts to shift forward coal bonus bid payments that would otherwise be received in future years. \n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)  \n \nThe Administration appreciates that the Committee supports the proposed termination of diesel \ngrants, termination of a homeland security grant program for local water infrastructure that has \nachieved its purpose, and other proposed reductions.  However, the Committee cancels  \n$142 million in unobligated balances from the State and Tribal Assistance Grants account, which \nis $132 million more than the request.  The Congress is urged not to exceed the proposed \ncancellation level.  Some unobligated balances are required to address active lawsuits or appeals; \na cut of this magnitude could create liabilities for EPA.  Furthermore, it would harm State \nenvironmental programs during a time of fiscal constraint because it would reduce funding that \nStates use to operate their delegated implementation of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and \nother environmental programs.  In addition, the Administration is concerned about the level of \nreductions to administrative functions and information technology which provide the backbone \nfor all of EPA\u2019s work to safeguard public health and the environment.   \n \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA)  \n \nThe Administration is pleased that the Committee funds the President\u2019s Protecting National \nForests Initiative.  However, the Administration does not believe that funds for this initiative \nshould be merged with the existing Legacy Road and Trail Remediation program, for which \nseparate funding was requested.  The Administration urges the Congress to remove the merger of \nfunds in order to permit greater flexibility in protecting natural resources and maintaining \nfacilities. \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of funding for the USDA Forest Service \nportion of the President\u2019s Conserving New Lands Initiative but urges the Congress to fully fund \nthe Forest Legacy program component. \n \nThe John F.

However, the Committee\u2019s version of the bill adds  \n$2.5 million above the requested amount for a program to train arts managers throughout the \nUnited States.  This program, like all other educational and performance programs at the Center, \nis currently funded through private donations.  The Federal role in the Center has for many years \nbeen restricted to operation, maintenance, and capital repair of the presidential monument, and \nappropriating funds for this program would enlarge the Federal role, disrupting what is currently \nan effective public-private partnership. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nMarch 24, 2010 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4899 \u2013 Disaster Relief and Summer Jobs Act of 2010 \n(Rep.

This legislation is essential to keeping the Nation prepared for domestic disasters \nby providing recovery assistance across the Nation for situations ranging from earthquakes and \nhurricanes to terrorist incidents.  It also takes another important step forward in the ongoing effort to \nhelp put Americans back to work through the expansion of a youth summer jobs program and offers \ncontinued support to America\u2019s small businesses, which are the backbone of the American economy.   \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee's support for $5.1 billion in supplemental funding for \nDRF.  The additional funding will provide much-needed response and recovery assistance across the \ncountry.  The 59 disasters and seven emergencies declared in 2009 involved 33 States or territories, \nand as of March 22, 2010, another 18 disasters and four emergencies have been declared in 16 \ndifferent States or territories.  This supplemental funding will also support the ongoing recovery \nefforts in the Gulf Coast region in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. \n \nSummer Employment Programs for Youth \n \nThe Administration supports the inclusion of $600 million for the Workforce Investment Act youth \nprogram for summer employment opportunities for disadvantaged youth. This funding will create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs and help young people open the door to future opportunities, while \nenabling them to generate additional income during these difficult economic times. \n \nSmall Business Administration (SBA) \n \nThe Administration supports the provision providing approximately one month of additional funds to \nSBA to continue Recovery Act terms that reduce fees and provide higher guarantees on SBA business \nguaranteed loans.

The Administration urges the Congress to move expeditiously to approve this \nfunding to help the people of Iraq take responsibility for their own future and work to disrupt, \ndismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  The Administration looks forward \nto working with Congress going forward to ensure that these priorities are maintained and that \nunnecessary items and earmarks are not included in a final conference bill. \n \nForeign Operations Matters \n \nThe Administration appreciates that the Committee supports the President\u2019s international \naffairs priorities, including those involving Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq.  In addition, the \nAdministration welcomes the Committee's support for Administration efforts to assist the \nPalestinian people, bolster the Mexican government\u2019s efforts to combat drug trafficking and \norganized crime, meet humanitarian needs worldwide, and help to address the impact of the \nglobal financial crisis on developing countries.  The Administration commends the Committee \nfor expanding the U.S. participation in the IMF New Arrangements to Borrow, and increasing \nthe U.S. quota subscription\u2014crucial measures to protect U.S. economic interests and stabilize \nthe global financial system. \n \nThe Administration also appreciates that the Committee provides the authorization \nnecessary for the United States to meet its international commitments to the International \nDevelopment Association and the African Development Fund.  \n \n2009-H1N1 Influenza \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee's inclusion of resources to respond to the \ncurrent 2009-H1N1 influenza outbreak and to prepare for a possible future pandemic influenza.  \nThe President requested additional funds and flexibility to enhance our Nation\u2019s capability to \nrespond domestically and internationally.  Given the unpredictability and uncertainty of the  outbreak, it is important to have maximum flexibility to be able to allocate and deploy resources \nto the most critical activities as the outbreak evolves.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress to enact the appropriate funding and authorities to support the \nresponse to the outbreak. \n   \n* * * * * \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nSeptember 10, 2009 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3288 \u2014 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and   \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 \n(Sen. Inouye, D-Hawaii) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 3288, with the Senate Committee-\nreported bill, making appropriations for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and \nrelated agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010. \n \nThe President believes that America\u2019s economic success in the 21st Century depends significantly \non a modernized infrastructure, from roads and highways to high-speed rail, inland waterways, and \nhousing.  These infrastructure investments will help build a new foundation for long-term \neconomic growth to benefit the American people for years to come. \n \nThe President requested, and the Committee approved, significant new resources for the Nation\u2019s \nroad, rail, and air transportation systems.  The legislation takes an important step toward \nmodernizing what has become an outdated and over-stressed transportation network.  Importantly, \nthe legislation not only invests in new systems, but also works to improve the safety of those \nsystems already in place.  Increased funding for transit and air travel safety will result in fewer \naccidents and more lives saved.  \n \nAdditionally, the funding included in the legislation for housing and community development \nprograms can serve as important anchors for locally-driven innovations.  With a strengthened \nsafety net for Americans facing significant hardship in these challenging economic times together \nwith funds dedicated to revitalizing local communities and expanding opportunities, this \nlegislation will help the Nation\u2019s urban and rural areas alike.  As part of this important agenda, the \nAdministration will work with the Congress to secure the funding needed to launch the Housing \nTrust Fund, which would expand the rental housing supply available for very low-income families. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nAdministration Priorities  \n \nNational Infrastructure Bank.  The Administration encourages the Congress to support the creation \nof a National Infrastructure Bank and not substitute in its place a national infrastructure grant \nprogram in conjunction with increases for transportation infrastructure credit.  Once established, a \nBank will help forge a new path forward in infrastructure sponsorship and cross-jurisdictional \npartnership.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as soon as possible \nto authorize a National Infrastructure Bank, which could blend grant and credit financing.  The \nBank will play a key role in supporting regionally and nationally significant, high-value, multi- modal projects selected on the basis of merit.   \n \nHigh-Speed Rail.  The Administration thanks the Committee for its support for capital grants that \nwould help sustain high-speed and intercity passenger rail corridor expansion. \n \nCombat Mortgage Fraud.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funds the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Combat Mortgage Fraud initiative, which will \nsupport a strong response to abusive practices that have taken advantage of home loan borrowers \nand contributed to financial market turmoil. \n \nChoice Neighborhoods.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides the \nrequested $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods, which will support the Administration\u2019s \nbroader effort to fight concentrated poverty and revitalize highly distressed neighborhoods. \n \nCommunity Development Block Grant (CDBG).  While the Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s pledge to fully fund CDBG, the Administration strongly \nurges the Congress to consider reforms to the program, particularly modernizing the outdated \nfunding formula to target funds to economically distressed communities more effectively, resulting \nin increased accountability. \n \nEfficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the \nPresident\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their usefulness, fund \nnarrowly focused activities, or duplicate existing programs, including programs not allocated \nbased on cost-benefit analysis. \n \nDepartment of Transportation \n \nThe Administration is pleased that the Committee supports the request for the Department of \nTransportation.  The Administration appreciates the provision of capital funding for the \nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which will help WMATA to address \nsafety shortfalls within its rail system.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nsupport for the funding provided to the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Next Generation Air \nTransportation System. \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance, \nProject-Based Rental Assistance, and Public Housing programs.  This funding is especially \nimportant in light of the current economic environment. \n \nThe Administration appreciates $75 million provided by the Committee for the Energy Innovation \nFund, but urges the Congress to include the full $100 million request to support local initiatives \nthat remove barriers to efficiency and leverage private sector funds.  The Fund will allow for the \nidentification of the most effective practices for replication across the Nation, increasing the \ndividends of energy efficiency investments in housing. \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for HUD\u2019s new Transformation \nInitiative, which sets aside funds for HUD to become a more innovative and accountable agency.  \nHowever, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the full $434 million in transfer \n2  authority for HUD programs.

Obey, D-Wisconsin) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3293, making appropriations for \nLabor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2010. \n \nCentral to the Nation\u2019s long-term economic success is an education system that responds to the \ndemands of today while anticipating students\u2019 needs in the years ahead.  The Administration\u2019s \nplans for a 21st Century education system begin with demanding effective reform and \naccountability coupled with the resources needed to carry out that reform.  The bill, as approved \nby the Committee, provides resources to begin this innovative education revolution. \n \nFrom doubling funding for research to accelerating the search for a cure for cancer and other \ndiseases, the President\u2019s plan would place renewed focus on the value of science to the Nation, \nstrengthening research that has the potential to revolutionize fields of medicine and lead to path-\nbreaking technologies.  The appropriations legislation approved by the Committee supports the \nPresident\u2019s plan. \n \nThe Committee bill also would expand Americans\u2019 access to quality health care close to home.  \nBuilding on the investments in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Committee bill \nenhances funding for community health centers, addresses health professional shortages in \nunderserved areas, and boosts public health support at the local and State levels. \n \nThis legislation also expands funds for workforce training with an increased focus on new clean-\nenergy industries and promising approaches.  Combined with improved enforcement of workplace \nsafety, working conditions, and benefit security, the bill provides important support for the \nPresident\u2019s plans to jumpstart the economy now, while giving American workers expanded \nopportunities in the years ahead. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n  Administration Priorities \n \nTeacher Incentive Fund (TIF).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s increased support \nfor TIF and strongly urges the Congress to adopt the President\u2019s full request. \n \nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) Research.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nsupport for NIH-funded research.  The President\u2019s Budget request placed a special emphasis on \ncancer research that would be funded through the scientific peer-review priority setting process.  \nBy 2010, cancer is expected to surpass heart disease as the number one leading cause of death \nglobally. \n \nCharter School Grants.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for increased \nCharter School funding and inclusion of a new provision to fund Charter School management \norganizations and the replication of effective Charter Schools.  The Administration urges the \nCongress to adopt the President\u2019s full request for the program and drop the limitation on funding \nunder the new provision. \n \nCorporation for National and Community Service.  The Administration strongly urges the \nCongress to fully fund the President\u2019s request and set the AmeriCorps program on a path to \n250,000 members by 2017, as authorized in the bipartisan Serve America Act.  The Administration \nalso urges full support for the Social Innovation Fund, a critical investment in finding, evaluating, \nand replicating the most effective approaches to challenges facing communities.  \n \nJob Training Initiatives.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the \ncritical job training initiatives proposed in the Budget, notably green jobs, transitional jobs, and the \nCareer Pathways Innovation Fund.    \n \nTeen Pregnancy Prevention.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee shifts resources \ninto a new, $114 million initiative for proven and promising efforts to prevent teen pregnancy. \n \nEvaluation and Data.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for increases in \nfunding for the Institute for Education Sciences, for evaluation at the Department of Labor and the \nCorporation for National and Community Service, and for a new workforce data quality initiative \nat the Department of Labor.  Because rigorous evaluation and accurate data are critical to the \neffective use of taxpayer dollars, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund its evaluation \nand data requests. \n \nSchool Improvement Grants.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee provided \nonly $546 million for School Improvement Grants, $1 billion less than the request.  The \nAdministration places a high priority on implementing effective strategies for turning around the \nNation\u2019s lowest-performing schools.  The Congress is urged to provide additional funding for \nschool improvement grants.  The Congress is urged to fund the Administration\u2019s full request for \nStriving Readers as opposed to creating programs at odds with the need for comprehensive reform. \n \nAutism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for \nexpanding funding for treatment, screenings, surveillance, public awareness, and research related \nto ASD at the Department of Health and Human Services.  \n \n2  Pandemic Influenza and Advanced Development.  The Administration appreciates that the \nCommittee provides the requested level for pandemic flu activities.  The Congress has been very \nsupportive of these efforts over the past several years, which have improved substantially the \nNation\u2019s preparedness for a pandemic.  The Administration also appreciates support for advanced \ndevelopment activities. \n  \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Program Integrity.  The Administration \nappreciates the Committee\u2019s support for strengthening program integrity in Medicare, Medicaid, \nand the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program by including $311 million requested for Health Care \nFraud and Abuse Control activities.  This funding will enable CMS to respond more rapidly to \nprogram integrity vulnerabilities, identify excessive payments, and establish new processes for \nimproving payment accuracy. \n \nHealth Care Workforce.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for increased \nfunding for key initiatives in workforce development.  The President believes that health \nprofessions training, including the placement of primary care providers in underserved areas, is \ncritical to improve access and quality of health care services.   \n \nSocial Security Administration (SSA).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support \nfor SSA, fully funding the request and adopting the program integrity proposal to reduce erroneous \npayments.  This funding will allow SSA to tackle increasing retirement claims, disability claims, \nand appeals hearings. \n \nEfficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support \nfor some of the President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their \nusefulness, fund narrowly focused activities, or duplicate existing programs, in particular the \nNational Institute for Literacy.  The Administration encourages the Congress to reconsider other \nproposals made by the Administration that would better target scarce resources and redirect funds \nto programs with greater potential for results.   \n \nDepartment of Education \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for several of the President\u2019s education \npriorities.  However, the Congress is urged to fully fund the Innovation Fund, which supports \nproven and promising approaches to lifting student achievement, and which was first created under \nthe Recovery Act. \n \nDepartment of Labor \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the Department of Labor.  While the \nAdministration acknowledges the Committee\u2019s strong support for worker protection, it encourages \nthe Congress to consider full funding the request to rebuild the capacity of these agencies to \nprotect the wages and working conditions of the Nation\u2019s workers, and reduce the amount of the \nH-1B rescission, which at its current level jeopardizes the Department\u2019s enforcement capacity. \n \n3  Department of Health and Human Services \n \nExpanding Public Health Services.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for a \nnumber of important public health activities, including enhancing the prevention and treatment of \nHIV/AIDS, improving rural health services and children\u2019s mental health services, and increasing \nthe treatment capacity of drug courts.  \n \nCMS Research.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the $57 million requested in \nthe President\u2019s Budget to fund research, demonstration, and evaluation for Medicare and Medicaid \nto find ways to provide higher quality care at lower costs, improve beneficiary education and \nunderstanding of benefits, and better align provider payments with costs. \n \nAdministration for Children and Families.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee \nfully funded the President\u2019s request of $7.2 billion for Head Start and $20 million for a new child \nwelfare initiative.  \n \nStrengthening Communities Fund.

The DREAM Act would \nprovide conditional nonimmigrant status for five years to individuals who:  (1) came to the \nUnited States before turning 16 years old; (2) have lived continuously in the United States for at \nleast five years prior to the date of enactment; (3) were under the age of 30 on the date of \nenactment; (4) demonstrate good moral character; (5) are not inadmissible or deportable under a \nnumber of key grounds; and (6) have graduated from high school, have obtained a GED \ncertificate, or have been admitted to an institution of higher education in the United States.   \n \nBefore these individuals could apply for a five-year extension to their conditional nonimmigrant \nstatus, they would have to meet additional requirements \u2013 in particular, completion of at least \ntwo years of either college or military service.  After ten years, these individuals would be \neligible to apply for permanent resident status.  The young people who would be eligible for \nrelief under the DREAM Act are prime examples of the need for comprehensive immigration \nreform that is based on requiring accountability and responsibility from all \u2013 the government, \nemployers, and those who have entered the country illegally.  The present system is broken and \nthe Administration continues to call on the Congress to pass comprehensive reform.  While the \nbroader immigration debate continues, the Administration urges the House to take this important \nstep and pass the DREAM Act.  Young people who have spent much of their lives in the United \nStates and want to improve their lives and their Nation by pursuing higher education or \ndefending the United States as members of the Armed Forces should be given this opportunity to \nearn legal status.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nDecember 15, 2010 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nHouse Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2965 \u2013 Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal \nAct of 2010 \n  (Rep.

Statutory PAYGO would hold the Federal Government to a simple but important \nprinciple: new tax or entitlement legislation should be paid for.  H.R. 2920 would build on the \nexisting PAYGO congressional rules by strengthening enforcement mechanisms that would \nrequire offsetting revenue increases or mandatory spending reductions.  In the 1990s, statutory \nPAYGO proved successful in encouraging tough choices and helped to move the Federal \nGovernment from large deficits to surpluses.   \n \nThe Administration is committed to cutting the deficit in half by the end of the President\u2019s first \nterm.  Enacting statutory PAYGO would complement this effort and strengthen the budget \nprocess.  While PAYGO does not solve all budgetary problems, it was the lack of such discipline \nthat led to a near doubling of the long-term deficit over the course of just a few years in the early \n2000s.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to further refine the legislation.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \n  July 8, 2009 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3081 \u2013 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and  \nRelated Programs Appropriations Act, 2010 \n(Rep.

With resources dedicated to diplomatic and development efforts, this legislation is \na core piece of America\u2019s security strategy.  While U.S. military power provides a critical and \neffective tool for protecting the Nation, the investments in stability, security, and development in \nthis legislation will enhance our ability to effectively address the range of threats that the country \nfaces today. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nAdministration Priorities  \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s international affairs \npriorities that advance U.S. national security including expanding the Foreign Service, promoting \nthe President\u2019s Global Health Initiative, and providing assistance to partners, such as Afghanistan, \nPakistan, Iraq, and the West Bank/Gaza.  The Administration also thanks the Committee for its \nsupport for the Millennium Challenge Corporation. \n \nGlobal Health \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the President\u2019s Global Health \nInitiative and looks forward to working with the Congress on its planning and implementation.  \nThe Administration appreciates funding for the bilateral Global HIV/AIDS and malaria programs \nat the President\u2019s requested levels, but urges the Congress to fully fund the request for the \nNeglected Tropical Disease program that works toward the elimination of several preventable and \ntreatable diseases. \n  International Monetary Fund \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes provisions that affect U.S. participation in the International \nMonetary Fund and that would limit future efforts to respond to urgent and unanticipated financial \ncrises. \n \nDiplomatic Operations in Iraq \n \nThe Administration appreciates funding provided for Diplomatic and Consular Programs.  The \nAdministration is concerned, however, about the reduction of over $200 million for Department of \nState operations in Iraq.  This reduction could hinder needed operational support and security \nprograms during a key transition period for the U.S. presence in Iraq.   \n \nMultilateral Development Banks \n \nWhile the Administration welcomes the funding provided for multilateral development banks, the \nCongress is urged to restore the requested funding of $85 million for arrears to the International \nDevelopment Association (IDA).  These IDA arrears support grants to the very poorest countries, \nmost of which are in Africa, and are also needed to prevent the United States from falling farther \nbehind in meeting its commitment to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. \n \nInternational Climate Assistance \n \nThe increase in international climate assistance proposed by the President is an important step to \nreestablish U.S. leadership in addressing global climate change.  The Administration appreciates \nthe Committee\u2019s support for this activity, but the bill is still $351 million below the request, \nincluding a $300 million reduction to the request for Department of Treasury climate programs.  \nThe Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the President\u2019s request for climate assistance \nand to remove restrictions that limit the ability of the Clean Technology Fund to catalyze private-\nsector investment in cleaner, low-carbon technologies. \n \nCivilian Stabilization Initiative \n \nThe Administration is concerned about the $168 million net reduction to the request for the \nCivilian Stabilization Initiative, which is a critical component of building civilian capacity to \nrespond to pressing national security concerns.   \n \nGlobal Food Security \n \nThe President has announced his intention to double U.S. financial support for agricultural \ndevelopment in developing countries to \u201cgive people the tools they need to lift themselves out of \npoverty.\u201d  The Administration requested $1.36 billion for agricultural development. Of the total, \nAfghanistan and Pakistan make up roughly $350 million.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support for this activity, but given the decreases in funding to key accounts that fund \nagricultural development, as well as the increases in funding levels for other crosscutting \nrequirements, we are concerned that there will not be sufficient funding available in this Act to \nmeet the President\u2019s goals.  The Congress is urged to provide sufficient flexibility so that the \nPresident can advance the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to agricultural development.  \n \n2  Constitutional Concerns \n \nConsistent with the President\u2019s statement in signing the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, the \nAdministration is concerned about section 7050 of the bill, which could constrain the President\u2019s \nauthority as Commander-In-Chief.  Similarly, consistent with longstanding Executive Branch \nconcerns about similar provisions, reflected recently in the President\u2019s statement in signing \nthe Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, and the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, language \nwithin sections 7026, 7030, 7054, 7069, 7070, 7071, 7081, and the International Monetary Fund \namendment, could constrain the President\u2019s authority to conduct foreign affairs by directing \nExecutive officials to adopt certain positions or objectives in negotiations and other diplomatic \ninteractions.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address the \nconstitutional concerns with respect to these provisions. \n \n* * * * * * * \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nOctober 28, 2009 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3854 \u2014 Small Business Financing and Investment Act of 2009 \n(Rep. Schrader, D-Oregon, and 5 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration supports legislation to expand financial assistance to small businesses and \nincrease their access to capital.  Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and \nare responsible for nearly 65 percent of job creation.  The Administration is committed to helping \nentrepreneurs as they undertake new business ventures, expand existing ones, and hire more \nAmericans in the process.   \n \nOn October 21st, the President announced the Administration\u2019s proposals to more than double the \nmaximum size of loans to small businesses that the Small Business Administration (SBA) can \nguarantee under the 7(a) loan program from $2 million to $5 million.  Similarly, maximum long-\nterm financing that SBA provides through Certified Development Companies under the section \n504 program is proposed to increase from $2 million to $5 million for standard borrowers and \nfrom $4 million to $5.5 million for manufacturers.  Finally, the maximum size for small business \nmicroloans would increase from $35,000 to $50,000.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress on these proposals as H.R. 3854 continues to be developed in the \nlegislative process. \n \nH.R. 3854 includes a number of provisions that the Administration believes will provide much \nneeded assistance to small businesses, such as increased maximum loan sizes for the SBA's \nflagship 7(a) and section 504 programs.  The bill also contains a number of additional provisions \nthat the Administration believes can be modified to strengthen the assistance provided to small \nbusiness, the engine of the Nation\u2019s economic recovery.  These provisions include new programs \nthat overlap to varying degrees with current authorities or might expose taxpayers to higher than \nnecessary costs.  To achieve a medium-term economic recovery that will create jobs and promote \nthe expansion of small businesses overall, the Administration supports fiscally responsible \napproaches to expanding assistance for small businesses.    \n \nThe Administration supports swift and aggressive action to ensure the Nation\u2019s small businesses \nhave the capital they need to seize opportunities and create jobs.  Passage of H.R. 3854 in the \nHouse is an important step in the legislative process, and the Administration encourages the \nCongress to build on that foundation by incorporating the President's proposals to further assist \nsmall businesses. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nNovember 18, 2009 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3961 \u2014 Medicare Physician Payment Reform Act of 2009 \n(Rep. Dingell, D-Michigan, and 6 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3961, the Medicare Physician \nPayment Reform Act of 2009, and appreciates congressional efforts to ensure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries and TRICARE patients continue to have access to care and their physician of \nchoice.  In his FY 2010 Budget, the President recognized the need for comprehensive reform for \nthe Medicare physician payment system.  The Administration believes Medicare and the country \nneed to move toward a system in which doctors receive better incentives to provide their patients \nwith higher quality and more efficient care. \n \nH.R. 3961 takes additional steps to reform Medicare physician payments.  The Administration is \npleased that the bill would eliminate the steep payment cut scheduled for 2010.  A cut of this \nmagnitude could reduce access to physicians for Medicare beneficiaries throughout the country.  \nThe Administration also supports the provisions that provide a boost to primary care providers by \nincreasing payments for evaluation and management services, such as office visits.  H.R. 3961 \nwould also create incentives for broader reforms for Medicare physician payments by \nencouraging the formation of accountable care organizations, in which groups of providers are \njointly responsible for the quality and cost of health care services for beneficiaries with chronic \nconditions.  The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress to achieve \ncomprehensive reforms to Medicare physician payments that will enhance efficient and high-\nquality care for beneficiaries and protect their choice of physicians.  H.R. 3961 is an important \nstep forward in comprehensively reforming the way Medicare pays physicians to provide the very \nbest care to the Nation\u2019s Medicare beneficiaries and the Administration urges the Congress to \npass this legislation.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n    June 14, 2010  \n    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \n \nH.R. 5297 \u2013 Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010,  \nState Small Business Credit Initiative Act of 2010, and \nSmall Business Early-Stage Investment Program Act of 2010  \n(Rep.

Small businesses are the \nbackbone of the American economy and where most new jobs begin.  One of the major \nchallenges facing small business owners is access to the credit that they need to grow and hire.  \nThe House legislation includes two important Administration proposals to help address that \nproblem.  First, the legislation would establish a Small Business Lending Fund that provides \nincentives for smaller banks to make new loans.  Second, the legislation would establish a State \nSmall Business Credit Initiative that would spur over $20 billion in new lending through \ninnovative State-based programs at a time when States are being forced to cut back on them due \nto budget shortfalls.  In addition, related legislation that the Administration understands will be \nincorporated into H.R. 5297 includes the President\u2019s proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on \nowners of small business stock, a step that will spur investment, innovation, and job creation by \nsmall businesses.  \n \nIn addition to the two lending initiatives described above, the Administration also looks forward \nto working with Congress on the initiatives the Administration has worked on with the House \nand Senate Small Business Committees that will allow creditworthy small businesses to expand \nand create jobs. \n \n*  *  *  *  *  *  * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                             \n  June 24, 2009 \n  (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2647 - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 \n(Rep. Skelton, D-Missouri, and 1 cosponsor) \n \nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2647, the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2010.  The Administration appreciates the House Armed Services \nCommittee's continued strong support of our national defense, including its support for the \nDepartment's topline budget requests for both the base budget and for overseas contingency \noperations. \n \nThe Administration appreciates, among other things, the leadership of the Committee in \nsupporting many of the President's initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have troubled \nhistories, or that failed to demonstrate adequate performance when compared to other programs \nand activities needed to carry out U.S. national security objectives.  In addition, the \nAdministration welcomes the Committee's support for the Secretary of Defense's plan to increase \nthe size of the civilian acquisition workforce and reduce the Department's reliance on contractors \nfor critical acquisition functions.  Also, the Administration appreciates that the Committee \nincluded authorities that are important to field commanders, such as the Commanders' \nEmergency Response Program and the authority to reimburse coalition partners. \n \nWhile there are many areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration nonetheless \nhas serious concerns with a number of provisions that could constrain the ability of the Armed \nForces to carry out their missions, that depart from Secretary Gates' decisions reflected in the \nPresident's Fiscal Year 2010 Budget which carefully balanced fiscal constraints, program \nperformance, strategic needs and capabilities, or that raise other issues.  The Administration \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns, some of which are \noutlined below, and to refine this legislation to align it more closely with national defense \npriorities. \n \nF-22 Advance Procurement:  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions in the bill \nauthorizing $369 million in advanced procurement funds for F-22s in FY 2011.  The collective \njudgment of the Service Chiefs and Secretaries of the military departments suggests that a final \nprogram of record of 187 F-22s is sufficient to meet operational requirements.  If the final bill \npresented to the President contains this provision, the President's senior advisors would \nrecommend a veto.  \n \nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program:  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $603 \nmillion for development and procurement of the alternative engine program, and the requirement \nfor the Department to fund the alternative engine program in future budget requests to the \nPresident.  These changes will delay the fielding of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) capability and \ncapacity, adversely impacting the Department's overall strike fighter inventory.  In addition, the  Administration objects to provisions of the bill that mandate an alternative engine program for \nthe JSF.  The current engine is performing well with more than 11,000 test hours.  Expenditures \non a second engine are unnecessary and impede the progress of the overall JSF program.  \nAlleged risks of a fleet-wide grounding due to a single engine are exaggerated.  The Air Force \ncurrently has several fleets that operate on a single-engine source.  The Administration also \nobjects to the limit on the obligation of overall JSF development funding to 75% of the amount \nauthorized until Department of Defense (DOD) has obligated all funds provided in FY 2010 for \nthe alternative engine program.  If the final bill presented to the President would seriously \ndisrupt the F-35 program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto.  \n \nMissile Defense:  The Administration thanks the Committee for authorizing the President's full \nfunding request of $9.3 billion for missile defense programs, including $7.8 billion for the \nMissile Defense Agency.  These programs will protect the United States, our deployed forces, \nand allies against emerging missile threats.  However, the Administration has concerns with \nprovisions limiting U.S. engagements with NATO and European allies regarding missile \ndefenses. \n \nBuilding Partner Capacity:  The Administration urges the inclusion of its proposals to build the \ncapacity of partner-nation special and conventional forces in order to enhance and increase \ncoalition participation in Afghanistan and Iraq.  These initiatives will directly reduce the \npressure on U.S. forces.  These limited, one-year proposals, developed in close partnership with \nthe Department of State, are necessary for timely implementation of our new Afghanistan policy. \n Without these authorities, the United States would lose precious time in increasing the capacity \nand participation of our partners in that conflict and put additional U.S. personnel at risk.  The \nAdministration also urges that authority for the \"Section 1207\" reconstruction stabilization \nassistance be funded as requested. \n \nStrategic Airlift:  The Administration objects to provisions in the bill that require the Air Force \nto maintain a strategic airlift fleet of 316 aircraft.  The Department assesses aircraft requirement \nbased on capability, not aircraft numbers.  The restriction impairs the Department's ability to \nmanage the fleet and respond to combatant commanders' request for forces.  The Administration \nobjects to restrictions on C-5 retirements for the same reason. \n \nFutenma Replacement Facility, Okinawa:  The Administration objects to Section 2836, which \nwould limit the Secretary's authority to exercise reasonable judgment regarding airfield \noperations at the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF), which is planned for construction on \nOkinawa.  The current FRF configuration was agreed to during bilateral negotiations with the \ngovernment of Japan, and this provision places the resulting International Agreement at risk. \n \nNational Security Personnel System:  The Administration objects to Section 1112 because \nlegislative action on the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) is premature given the \nongoing review by DOD and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  This review will \nproduce findings and recommendations that will help DOD and OPM, working with the \nCongress, make informed decisions about the future of the program.  Of great concern is the \nprovision prohibiting DOD from adding any person to a position under NSPS after June 16, \n2009, which will cause significant, undue disruption to organizations currently operating under \nNSPS, potentially delaying the filling of thousands of positions and harming the Department's in-\nsourcing efforts. \n \n2  Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System:  The Administration is concerned that Section \n1113, which prohibits new Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS) conversions \nand mandates termination of the entire system, will prevent the Intelligence Community from \ntransforming itself into a single enterprise that can recruit and retain a competitive workforce to \nmeet our national security needs.  DCIPS is part of a broader effort to reward employee \nperformance, called the National Intelligence Civilian Compensation Program (NICCP), which \nis modeled after the successful program within the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. \n \nAircraft Retirements:  The Administration objects to provisions of the bill that restrict aircraft \nretirements.  The Air Force has provided its analysis supporting accelerated aircraft retirements \nwith the Congress.  Retirements accompanied by modifications and other enablers provide a \nsmaller, but more flexible, lethal, and capable force.  The Air Force has provided a base-by-base \nsummary of the restructuring, including mission end states.  The restrictions currently in the bill \nwill impair the Department\u2019s ability to manage its fleet and manpower to accomplish national \npriority missions.  \n \nExtended Range Multi-Purpose (ER/MP) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle:  The Administration \nobjects to a reduction of $163 million to the Extended Range Multi-Purpose Unmanned Aerial \nVehicle program, which would result in a 50-percent cut of the ER/MP systems planned for FY \n2010.  The ER/MP is an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance asset critical for force \nprotection and current operations.   \n \nFull Funding:  The Administration is concerned that H.R. 2647 authorizes incremental funding \nof Military Construction projects, and authorizes the Navy to use advance procurement funds to \nbegin construction of aircraft carriers.  As a matter of fiscal prudence, the Administration \nencourages full funding of these programs, consistent with the President's Budget. \n \nDefense Environmental Cleanup:  The Administration objects to the $471 million reduction for \nthe Department of Energy's Environmental Management program.  This reduction will \nsignificantly impede progress in cleaning up the legacy of waste and contamination resulting \nfrom nuclear weapons production. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \n  July 15, 2009 \n  (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3170 \u2013 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2010 \n(Rep. Obey, D-Wisconsin) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3170, making appropriations for \nfinancial services and general government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010. \n \nAmerica\u2019s economic strength depends, in part, on a strong financial system with effective, \nimpartial regulation that enforces the rules of the road and protects investors and consumers of all \nsizes.  That is why the President proposed new resources for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Products Safety Commission, and \nother Federal regulators, giving them the staffing and the resources necessary to pursue a more \nefficient and effective regulatory structure to better detect fraud and strengthen markets.  This \nlegislation follows through on the President\u2019s request for robust resources for these agencies. \n \nSimilarly, the President proposed an aggressive program to identify fraud and reinforce program \nintegrity.  It is estimated that Internal Revenue Service (IRS) efforts to address tax fraud recoup $5 \nfor every $1 spent.  The Administration appreciates the commitment to this effort and to improving \nservices for taxpayers that is demonstrated in the bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nAdministration Priorities  \n \nInternal Revenue Service Tax Enforcement.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nsupport for IRS Enforcement, fully funding the request and adopting the program integrity \nproposal for enhanced tax enforcement activities.  This critical program supports the \nAdministration\u2019s initiatives to improve the fairness of our tax system, closing the gap between \ntaxes owed and taxes paid, through a robust portfolio of new enforcement initiatives, particularly \nin the international tax area. \n \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFI).  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support for CDFI, including $80 million requested to implement the Capital Magnet \nFund. \n \nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax & Trade Bureau (TTB).  The Administration urges the Congress to \nauthorize the TTB to collect licensing and registration fees from producers, wholesalers, and \nretailers of beverage alcohol.  Funding TTB through fees would properly assign the cost of \nkeeping consumers safe to those who profit from the sale of alcoholic beverages.  This proposal  would also bring TTB\u2019s funding mechanism in line with other regulatory agencies across the \nGovernment. \n \nEfficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support \nfor proposed reductions, including the termination of additional Federal funding for the \nChristopher Columbus Fellowship Foundation and the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation, \nprograms that have historically been supported by endowed trust funds.  The Administration urges \nthe Congress to adopt the President\u2019s other proposals, especially for those items that fund narrowly \nfocused activities or duplicate existing programs that accomplish similar goals. \n \nDepartment of the Treasury  \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes the language in the bill that attempts to restore prior Chrysler \nand General Motors (GM) franchise agreements.  The auto companies, like many in the country, \nface difficult economic and fiscal decisions.  The Administration shares the Committee\u2019s concern \nfor dealers affected by Chrysler and GM bankruptcy agreements, and has taken steps to help \nsupport viable dealerships during this transition.  For example, on July 1st, the Small Business \nAdministration implemented a new program to provide guaranteed floor plan financing loans.  \nHowever, the decision by Chrysler and GM to rationalize their dealer networks was a critical part \nof their overall restructuring to achieve long-term viability in order to save jobs in the long run, \nand to improve the prospects for the companies\u2019 repayment of the substantial taxpayer \ninvestments.  Without the significant steps these automakers have taken to revamp their \noperations, the companies would have failed \u2013 imperiling every GM and Chrysler dealer in the \ncountry.  Under the automakers\u2019 new structure, the overwhelming majority of GM and Chrysler \ndealers will continue operating with the new companies.  The decision to invest taxpayer dollars \ninto these companies required all stakeholders to make difficult sacrifices, and it would set a \ndangerous precedent, potentially raising legal concerns, to intervene into a closed Judicial \nbankruptcy proceeding on behalf of one particular group at this point. \n \nThe Administration appreciates the funding provided for the Office of Domestic Finance and \nOffice of Tax Policy.  Additional staff in these offices will work on key aspects of the financial \ncrisis, including implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and financial \nstability programs and key tax policy issues.   \n \nDistrict of Columbia (D.C.)  \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s full funding of many critical D.C. initiatives, \nincluding permanent housing assistance targeted for the District\u2019s homeless population, water and \nsewer infrastructure, and funds to support school improvement initiatives.  The Administration \nalso appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for continuing the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship \nprogram for only those students currently enrolled in the program. \n \nSmall Business Administration  \n \nThe Administration appreciates the strong support for the Small Business Administration\u2019s \nprograms, which are particularly helpful during the current economic environment.   \n \n2  Executive Office of the President (EOP)  \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the EOP, particularly in \nproviding efficiencies through consolidating the budgets of the White House Office and the Office \nof Policy Development and the funding provided to the Office of Administration to stabilize and \nmodernize the current antiquated and deteriorating information technology at the White House.  \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s efforts to improve the \nprogram integrity of Federal assistance programs administered by States by providing $40 million \nfor this effort. \n \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).  The Administration appreciates the funding \nprovided for ONDCP.  However, the Administration is concerned that the Committee redirects \nfunding requested for the National Media Campaign to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \nprogram.\u00a0\n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSection 714 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch to \ndisclose, without discretion, certain classified and other privileged information, in which case it \nwould intrude on the President\u2019s discharge of his constitutional authorities.    \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                             \n  June 3, 2009 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n  H.R. 626 \u2014 Federal Employees Paid Parental Leave Act of 2009 \n  (Rep.

The Administration commends the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee for its extraordinary efforts in developing historic bipartisan comprehensive energy \nand climate legislation that creates the framework to accomplish these goals.  The \nAdministration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 2454. \n \nFor decades, the energy crisis has largely been ignored, imperiling our economy, our national \nsecurity, and our planet.  The President has challenged all of us to make America the nation that \nleads the 21st century by unleashing innovation and utilizing advanced technology in the clean \nenergy sector.  H.R. 2454 contains authorities to move the country in that direction.  This \nlegislation would establish energy efficiency and clean energy requirements for U.S. electric \nutilities, promote advanced carbon capture and sequestration technology and clean transportation \ninfrastructure and vehicles, and improve energy efficiency in buildings, lighting, and appliances. \n \nH.R. 2454 would, for the first time, create a system of clean energy incentives designed to \njumpstart the economy, address carbon pollution, and result in significantly reduced U.S. \nemissions.  The bill contains provisions to protect consumers, keep costs low, help sensitive \nindustries transition to a clean energy economy, and promote domestic emission reduction efforts \nthat will lead to real global emission reductions.  This legislation would strengthen U.S. \nleadership in the global effort to address climate change and encourage other nations in their \nefforts to prevent deforestation and adopt clean energy technology.  Further, the bill would \nadvance ongoing U.S. efforts to understand and adapt to the myriad challenges posed by climate \nchange and assist the most vulnerable countries to address its effects.  The Administration \nstrongly supports a robust and effective agriculture and forestry offsets program and appreciates \nthe efforts of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Agriculture \nCommittee toward that end. \n \nAs this complex bill moves through the legislative process, the Administration feels strongly that \nthe enacted bill must be consistent with our international obligations and an open and integrated \nglobal economic system.  It must meet the President's objectives of creating a clean economy \nthrough an efficient, cost-effective, and comprehensive approach that leverages the Nation's \ncapacity for innovation, creates jobs, reduces dependence on oil, is consistent with the \nAdministration's financial regulatory reform proposal, and makes the United States a leader in \nefforts to address climate change. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n    July 27, 2010 \n    (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 3628 - Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on  \nSpending in Elections (DISCLOSE) Act   \n(Sen.

The Administration believes \nthe DISCLOSE Act is a necessary measure so that Americans will know who is trying to \ninfluence the Nation\u2019s elections.  S. 3628 also prevents those who should not interfere in the \nNation\u2019s elections \u2013 such as corporations controlled by foreign interests \u2013 from doing so.  Unless \nthe strong new disclosure rules in S. 3628 are established, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the \nCitizens United case will give corporations undue power to influence elections.

This Statement of Administration Policy does not \naddress H.R. 1886, although the Administration understands that the Rule proposes to \nincorporate this bill into H.R. 2410. \n \nThe Administration strongly supports the bill's inclusion of authorizations of appropriations at \nlevels that will strengthen U.S. diplomatic capacity and will allow the United States to meet its \nfinancial obligations to the United Nations and other international organizations and to begin \nsynchronizing payments to international organizations where the United States has been \nchronically late in paying its assessments. \n \nThe Administration also welcomes the inclusion of a number of authorities in the bill that \nsupport diplomatic operations.

The Administration also welcomes the increased flexibility for \nthe State Department to use registration fees collected under the Arms Export Control Act. \n \nThese many areas of agreement notwithstanding, the Administration has concerns about \nprovisions in the bill that could constrain the ability of the President and the Secretary of State to \nconduct foreign affairs and manage the Department with the necessary degree of flexibility.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with Congress to address these concerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nJuly 8, 2009 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n  H.R. 2701 \u2013 Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 \n  (Rep. Reyes, D-Texas) \n \nThe Administration supports House passage of an Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 2010 that \nwould support the Intelligence Community (IC) and the Community\u2019s mission to conduct \nintelligence activities to protect the Nation.  The Administration appreciates the House Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence's inclusion in H.R. 2701 of many provisions submitted by the \nAdministration.   \n \nAlthough the Administration is pleased with the many favorable provisions in the bill, the \nAdministration has serious concerns with a number of provisions that would impede the smooth \nand efficient functioning of the IC and that would raise a number of policy, management, legal, \nand constitutional concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to \naddress these concerns, some of which are outlined below, in order to enhance the effectiveness \nand capabilities of the IC on behalf of the Nation.  \n \nWhile the Administration appreciates the funding authorized for critical intelligence programs as \ndescribed in the classified schedule, it has serious concerns with certain funding reductions and \nother matters in the classified schedule that will be addressed separately by the Administration.  \n \nReport on Covert Actions (Section 321).  The Administration strongly objects to section 321, \nwhich would replace the current \u201cGang of 8\u201d notification procedures on covert activities.  There is \na long tradition spanning decades of comity between the branches regarding intelligence matters, \nand the Administration has emphasized the importance of providing timely and complete \ncongressional notification, and using \u201cGang of 8\u201d limitations only to meet extraordinary \ncircumstances affecting the vital interests of the United States.  Unfortunately, section 321 \nundermines this fundamental compact between the Congress and the President as embodied in \nTitle V of the National Security Act regarding the reporting of sensitive intelligence matters \u2013 an \narrangement that for decades has balanced congressional oversight responsibilities with the \nPresident\u2019s responsibility to protect sensitive national security information.  Section 321 would run \nafoul of tradition by restricting an important established means by which the President protects the \nmost sensitive intelligence activities that are carried out in the Nation's vital national security \ninterests.  In addition, the section raises serious constitutional concerns by amending sections 501-\n503 of the National Security Act of 1947 in ways that would raise significant executive privilege \nconcerns by purporting to require the disclosure of internal Executive branch legal advice and \ndeliberations.  Administrations of both political parties have long recognized the importance of \nprotecting the confidentiality of the Executive Branch's legal advice and deliberations.  If the final \nbill presented to the President contains this provision, the President's senior advisors would \nrecommend a veto.    \n  Increased Presidentially Appointed and Senate Confirmed (PAS) positions (Sections 424, 426, and \n427).  H.R. 2701 creates five new PAS positions.  Consistent with the 9/11 Commission\u2019s \nrecommendations, the Administration believes that if these provisions were to become law, critical \nnational security positions would remain unfilled for significant periods of time and create \ndisruption across the IC.  Further while the Administration agrees in concept to the establishment \nof Inspectors General, the Administration would want to work closely with the Congress to \nharmonize any new roles and responsibilities of a new Inspector General of the National Security \nAgency with those of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense.   \n \nProhibiting the Implementation of the Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS) \n(Section 304).  The Administration is concerned that section 304 will prevent the IC from \ntransforming itself into a single enterprise that can recruit and retain a competitive workforce to \nmeet national security needs.  The DCIPS is consistent with a broader, long-standing pay-for-\nperformance effort.  In addition, the substantial reduction in funds provided for the IC in transition \nto pay-for-performance will severely undermine the Administration's efforts to build an \nintelligence workforce for the 21st century.    \n \nPersonnel Ceiling Adjustments (Section 103).  The Administration objects to section 103.  \nCongressionally imposed personnel ceilings on IC civilian employment are inflexible, force the \nuse of often more expensive contractors, and severely hinder the IC\u2019s civilian joint duty, student \nemployment, and National Intelligence Reserve Corps (NIRC) programs. \n \nInspector General for the Intelligence Community (Section 406).  The Administration supports the \nimportant work undertaken by Inspectors General in serving as watchdogs for transparency, \naccountability, and efficiency, and would like to work with the Congress on the optimal approach \nand authorities for carrying out the important functions of Inspectors General in the context of the \nIC.  Although the Administration supports section 406\u2019s expansion of the protections and \nlimitations of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, the Administration is \nconcerned that the bill as drafted could be understood to constrain the President\u2019s constitutional \nauthority to review and, if appropriate, control disclosure of certain classified information.  \nAdministration officials are working closely with Senate and House staff to craft appropriate \nwhistleblower enhancement protections for intelligence community whistleblowers through \nseparate legislative vehicles, H.R. 1507 and S. 372, and urge that the whistleblower enhancement \nprovision in this bill account for Administration proposals offered in those contexts to address \nconstitutional and other concerns with the current formulation. \n \nGAO Review of Intelligence Community Matters (Section 335).  Section 335 would fundamentally \nshift the long-standing relationship and information flow between the IC and intelligence \ncommittee members and staff.  The Administration has committed to be forthcoming with the \ncommittees and to provide access to the information they need to conduct their oversight.  The \nAdministration would welcome the opportunity to more fully address this matter before \nfundamental changes to the oversight process are legislated. \n \nReporting Requirements (various sections).  The Administration objects to a number of reporting \nrequirements contained in the bill, such as sections 332, 345, 354, and 366, as well as purportedly \nin the classified annex.  Section 356 would incorporate by reference all reporting requirements in \nthe classified annex into the act, thereby making them a requirement in law.  The Administration \nobjects to the passage of such substantive secret provisions of law.  \nFurther, such a provision would remove the flexibility that Congress and the Executive branch \n2  would otherwise have to modify and adapt provisions in the classified annex to meet changing \nconditions and requirements without seeking a statutory change from the full Congress. \n \nProhibition on use of funds to provide Miranda warnings to certain persons outside of the United \nStates (Section 504).  The Administration strongly objects to section 504, prohibiting Miranda \nwarnings abroad, which may take the prosecution option off the table in the United States \nGovernment's fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates and deny the government an important tool \nused by the previous Administration to preserve legal options. Indeed, the practice in the previous \nAdministration had been to provide Miranda warnings to persons outside of the United States, \nrecognizing the value of preserving the option to prosecute terrorists in our system of justice.  The \nNation needs at its disposal every tool in the national security toolbox, including the ability to \nbring terrorist prosecutions.   \n \nNational Security Information (Section 502).  The Administration objects to this section, which \nwould move the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE) into the \nExecutive Office of the President.  The Administration is still reviewing how to make the PM-ISE \nmost effective and believes such legislation is premature and could create undue administrative \nand managerial burdens by creating a completely new category of information for agencies to \nmanage. The Administration would like to work with Congress to meet its goals through non-\nlegislative means. \n  \n* * * * * * * \n3  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nApril 12, 2010 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4851 \u2013 Continuing Extension Act of 2010 \n (Rep.

Harkin, D-Iowa) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment \nExtension Act of 2009.  The Ryan White program provides critical health care and related services \nto uninsured and underinsured people living with HIV/AIDS.  This legislation authorizes \nappropriations for the program for the next four years.   \n \nThe Administration is committed to strengthening access to care for people living with HIV/AIDS. \nThe legislation reauthorizes all parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and supports \ncontinued funding for the Minority AIDS Initiative, the goal of which is to address the \ndisproportionate impact of the disease on racial and ethnic minorities. \n \nWhen the program was last reauthorized in 2006, the Congress took steps to ensure that the \nprogram adopted names-based HIV case data as a basis for funding allocations to direct resources \nto areas of greatest need.  This bill recognizes that some States\u2019 HIV case reporting systems are not \nyet fully matured, and continues funding for jurisdictions with HIV surveillance systems that are \nstill transitioning.  In recognition of the growing epidemic outside of major urban areas with \nlongstanding epidemics, it is important that the Ryan White program evolve and move towards \ndetermining funding allocations based on valid, reliable HIV surveillance data.  The legislation \nalso supports continuing assistance to Transitional Grant Areas. \n \nThe Administration supports the provision in the legislation revising the threshold of unobligated \nbalances that triggers penalties for unexpended grant funds.  In an effort to simplify administration \nof the Ryan White programs, the Administration strongly supports the inclusion of a provision to \noffset unobligated balances from subsequent grant awards rather than cancellation of unobligated \namounts.  Implementation of the cancellation of unobligated balances has proven to be a barrier to \nefficient and timely disbursement and reallocation of these unexpended funds. \n \nThe Administration believes that the current bill makes important improvements in HIV/AIDS care \nand treatment and looks forward to working with the Congress on this effort to ensure that the \nRyan White Program provides the most efficient, effective systems of care for people living with \nHIV/AIDS. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJuly 29, 2010 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n  H.R. 5851 - Offshore Oil and Gas Worker Whistleblower Protection Act of 2010 \n  (Rep. Miller, D \u2013 California and Rep. Markey, D \u2013 Massachusetts) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5851, the \u201cOffshore Oil and Gas \nWorker Whistleblower Protection Act of 2010,\u201d because it would provide important \nwhistleblower protections to workers on the Outer Continental Shelf. \n \nAll workers should be able to protect their health and safety by reporting violations of the law or \nworkplace hazards without fear of retaliation from their employers.  These protections are \nparticularly important for workers whose lives depend on their employers\u2019 assurances of their \nsafety.  Congressional hearings have revealed that workers on the Deepwater Horizon offshore \noil drilling platform had significant safety concerns, but  feared they would lose their jobs if they \nspoke out.  Whistleblower protections must be meaningful so that workers feel secure enough to \nspeak up when they see hazards going unaddressed. \n \nThere is currently no Federal law adequately protecting offshore workers who blow the whistle \non worker health and safety hazards.  While there are some protections for workers who blow the \nwhistle on environmental or pipeline safety violations, these are not uniform.  H.R. 5851 would \nextend strong whistleblower protections to workers on the Outer Continental Shelf, including \nworkers who are part of a drilling or spill clean-up operation.  The bill would accomplish this by \nprohibiting retaliation against workers who, among other things, report violations relating to the \nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act or refuse to perform their duties based on the good faith \nbelief that the work could result in injury or illness, or could cause public harm, such as an oil \nspill.  H.R. 5851 also would provide that any covered worker who is a victim of retaliation be \nmade whole by reinstatement, back pay, and compensatory and punitive damages.   \n \nFor these reasons, the Administration strongly supports H.R. 5851, and urges its swift passage. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nOctober 5, 2009 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2847 \u2014 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 \n(Sen. Inouye, D-Hawaii)  \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 2847, with the Senate Committee-\nreported text, making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, and Science, \nand Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.   \n \nAs we face difficult economic and fiscal decisions, it is important to make efficient and effective \ninvestments.  The bill as considered by the Committee makes important investments in innovation \nand job creation, community safety, and cutting-edge technologies.  This legislation will help lay a \nnew foundation for long-term economic growth. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nAdministration Priorities  \n \nScience and Innovation.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee\u2019s bill includes more \nthan $200 million in reductions to requested levels for the National Science Foundation and the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology.  These two agencies are key components of the \nPresident\u2019s Plan for Science and Innovation and the Committee\u2019s reductions would affect \nimportant research activities and agency operations in the near term and make it increasingly \ndifficult to achieve the doubling goal for basic research in future years.  The bill includes $58 \nmillion in non-priority project funds for the National Institute of Standards and Technology that \ncould be channeled to reduce this shortfall. \n \nEfficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the \nPresident\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their usefulness, fund \nnarrowly focused activities, or duplicate existing programs.  The Administration encourages the \nCongress to reconsider other proposals made by the Administration that would better target scarce \nresources and redirect funds to programs with greater potential for results.  \n \nDepartment of Commerce \n \nThe Administration appreciates the support shown for Department of Commerce programs, \nparticularly for the 2010 Census, environmental stewardship, the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership Program, and Technology Innovation Program. \n \nEconomic Development Administration.  The Administration is concerned that the bill underfunds \nthe Economic Development Administration request by nearly $50 million, particularly in light of  current economic conditions.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the $284 million \nrequested, including $125 million for Economic Adjustment Assistance (EAA).  The $90 million \nthe bill provides for EAA is not enough to fully implement the Administration\u2019s proposals to \npromote regional innovation clusters and create a Business Incubator Network.  The \nAdministration has requested $50 million for each of these initiatives because they will help the \nNation to develop dynamic businesses and respond effectively to challenging economic \nconditions. \n \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s strong support of the important activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration.  However, within this funding level, the Administration urges the Congress to \nprovide the additional $13 million requested to support accelerated improvement of hurricane \ntrack and intensity forecasts, which will help to prevent unnecessary and costly evacuations.  \nAdditionally, the Administration urges the Congress to allocate resources based on a competitive \nand transparent process. \n \nInternational Trade Administration.  The Administration is concerned with the language directing \nthat negotiations be held within the World Trade Organization to allow its members to distribute \nantidumping and countervailing duties.  These duties are currently received by the Federal \nGovernment as general revenues; distributing them to domestic firms who already benefit from \nthese tariffs would provide a \u201cdouble benefit.\u201d  \n \nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support for allowing USPTO full access to its fee collections.  The Administration \nagrees with the Committee that USPTO should evaluate long-standing examination goals for \npatent employees to account for advances in technology and other changes in the patent \nexamination process.  USPTO is currently re-evaluating these goals and is working to obtain an \nindependent review of them.  The Congress is urged to allow this process to proceed and remove \nthe language in the bill that would block $25 million from obligation until new goals are adopted, \nto avoid unnecessary strain on USPTO\u2019s financial resources and operational flexibility. \n \nDepartment of Justice \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of the funding requests for Department of \nJustice programs including those of the FBI and other law enforcement components. However, the \nAdministration is concerned about the adequacy of funds provided for key initiatives such as the \nCOPS Hiring Grants Program and the Prisoner Reentry Initiative and additional funds are needed \nto maintain critical technology initiatives.  Unfortunately, the Committee has only provided one \nthird of the funding requested for the COPS Hiring Grant Program.  By providing the \nAdministration\u2019s full request for this program, more than 1,500 police could be hired \u2013 or kept in \ntheir jobs \u2013 in cities and towns across the country.  The Administration is also disappointed that \nthe Committee has provided no funding for Community-Based Violence Prevention Initiatives.  In \naddition, the changes made to section 505, in Division B of the FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations \nAct regarding reprogramming notifications, present significant management challenges for the \nDepartment in the execution of its law enforcement and other responsibilities and the Congress is \nurged to restore the language that was in effect prior to the Act.  \n \n2  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s FY 2010 request for \nNASA, including full funding for Science, Aeronautics, Space Shuttle, International Space Station, \nand Exploration Systems, and in the existing budget structure as proposed.  However, the \nAdministration is concerned with the reduction of $18.7 million from the request for NASA \ninnovation, which would reduce or eliminate several programs that use public-private partnerships \nto advance important technologies and enable access to new sources of innovation through \nincentive prizes and partnerships. \n \nNational Science Foundation \n \nThe Administration believes the directed transfer of icebreaker operations and maintenance \nfunding from the National Science Foundation to the Coast Guard is premature pending the \noutcome of several active policy reviews being conducted over the next two years that will better \ninform mission requirements for the U.S. polar icebreaker fleet going forward.  \n \nLegal Services Corporation (LSC) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committees modification of the restriction on the use of non-\nLSC funds by LSC grant recipients but also urges the Congress to allow LSC attorneys to collect \nfees and to participate in class action lawsuits.  These riders limit access to legal representation \nand constrain legal aid lawyers\u2019 ability to secure settlements and to pursue injunctive relief to stop \nillegal activity.  In addition, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the President\u2019s \nrequest. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nConsistent with longstanding Executive Branch concerns about similar provisions, sections 107 \nand 528 and language under the headings \u201cOperations and Administration, International Trade \nAdministration\u201d and \u201cSalaries and Expenses, Office of the United States Trade Representative\u201d \nwould interfere with the President\u2019s constitutional authority in the area of foreign affairs by \neffectively directing the Executive how to proceed or not to proceed in international negotiations.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n    July 29, 2010 \n    (House) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nH.R. 5893 \u2013 Investing in American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act of 2010 \n(Rep.

Carl Levin, D-Michigan) \n \nThe Administration supports Senate passage of S. 3454, the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2011.  The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee's \ncontinued support of our national defense, including, among other things, its support for the \nDepartment's topline budget requests for both the base budget and for overseas contingency \noperations.  The Administration welcomes the Committee's support for authorities that assist the \nability of the warfighter to operate in unconventional and irregular warfare environments, \nauthorities that are important to field commanders, such as the authority to reimburse coalition \npartners.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee supports the President\u2019s budget \nrequest, specifically by not authorizing funding for additional C-17 aircraft or for the F-35 Joint \nStrike Fighter (JSF) extra engine and by authorizing the phased adaptive approach for missile \ndefense in Europe. \n \nThere are many areas of agreement with the Committee\u2019s bill as reported; however, the \nAdministration has concerns with some of the restrictions placed on the Department of Defense, \nincluding potentially limiting its ability to effectively advance its priorities and streamline \noperations.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these \nconcerns, some of which are outlined in more detail below, and others which may be identified \nin a classified annex once it is made available. \n \nNational Guard Deployment to Secure the Southwest Border:  The Administration strongly \nobjects to Section 1041, which the Administration would construe to require the Secretary of \nDefense to authorize the funding for deployment, under title 32, United States Code, of at least \n6,000 National Guard personnel to undertake operations such as constructing fences and border \ncheckpoints, surveying the border, and providing radio communication interoperability among \nfederal, state and local law enforcement agencies, until the Secretary, in consultation with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the Governors of the border states, certifies to Congress \nthat the Federal Government has achieved \u201coperational control\u201d of the border.  The legislation \nwould unduly interfere with the President\u2019s role as Commander in Chief with respect to the \nmanagement of the Total Force.  The Administration continues to pursue a comprehensive, \nmulti-layered, targeted approach to law enforcement and security on the southwest border.  \nWithin this approach, the National Guard will be utilized to meet specific, requirements-based \nneeds where they can implement missions using their unique capabilities.  \n  \nBuilding Partner Capacity and Foreign Policy:  The Administration urges the inclusion of its \nrequested proposals, which were developed with close coordination between the Departments of \nDefense and State, to build the capacity of partner-nation special and conventional forces.  \nAmong other things, these proposals are important for the implementation of U.S. policy in \nAfghanistan, to enhance and increase coalition participation in Afghanistan in order to reduce the  pressure on U.S. forces, and to support the drawdown strategy in Iraq and counter-terrorism \nprograms.  To ensure consistency with broader foreign policy objectives, the Administration \nurges that any new foreign policy or assistance related authorities or requirements to do reports \nor determinations should require concurrence of the Secretary of State, particularly those in \nsections 1304 and 1534. \n \nCommanders\u2019 Emergency Response Program (CERP):  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s continued support for this critical program, but urges the restoration of funding to \nthe requested amount of $1.3 billion.  The CERP remains a critical enabler in support of the \nresponsible drawdown in Iraq and provides the people of Afghanistan with tangible, positive \neconomic opportunities and improvements at the local level, leveraging the execution of the \nshape, clear, hold, and build aspects of our strategy. \n \nIraqi Security Forces Fund (ISFF):  The Administration objects to the $1 billion reduction to the \nISFF, and the limitation placed on the obligation of these funds.  Full funding of the ISFF is \ncritical to the development of the Iraqi military and police so that they possess the minimum \nessential capabilities necessary for internal security and external defense.  Reducing the request \nwould impede the transition of responsibility necessary to complete the drawdown of U.S. forces \nin a responsible manner.  The new requirement for a determination on Iraqi commitment to build \nsecurity forces and the new authority to accept contributions should require concurrence of the \nSecretary of State to ensure consistency with broader foreign policy objectives.   \n \nPolicy Concerning Homosexuality in the Armed Forces:  The Administration supports section \n591 as it would allow for completion of the Comprehensive Review, enable the Department of \nDefense to assess the results of the review, and ensure that the implementation of the repeal is \nconsistent with the standards of military readiness, effectiveness, unit cohesion, recruiting and \nretention.  Such an approach recognizes the critical need to allow our military and their families \nthe full opportunity to inform and shape the implementation process through a thorough \nunderstanding of their concerns, insights and suggestions.  \n \nRestrictions on Guantanamo Detainee Transfers:  The Administration strongly objects to Section \n1044, which prohibits the use of Department of Defense funds to transfer individuals held at the \ndetention facilities at Guantanamo to the countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, \nSomalia and Yemen for one year following enactment of this bill.  Individual detainee transfer \ndeterminations should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all factors, including \nthe threat posed by the particular detainee, U.S. legal obligations and broader U.S. national \nsecurity interests.  This provision restricts the United States\u2019 ability to make these case-by-case \ndecisions for over seventy percent of the detainees being held at Guantanamo.  By precluding \ntransfers to these countries, section 1044 poses serious national security concerns, including by \nreducing the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to negotiate transfer conditions that promote national \nsecurity. \n \nGuam Basing:  The Administration is committed to addressing the needs in Guam (both on base \nand off) to allow for the realignment of Marines and their families from Japan.  That effort \nrequires a comprehensive government-wide approach.  The Administration is concerned with the  \n$320 million reduction in funding for Navy construction in Guam.  Deferral of funding \nrequirements into future years or reductions to the program will increase the total cost to the \nUnited States of the realignment.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress \nto provide additional details on program implementation to address the Committee\u2019s concerns.  \n2  Defense Weather Satellites:  The Administration objects to the committee\u2019s reduction of $241.8 \nmillion in funding for the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System \n(NPOESS) program.  The decision to restructure the program, taken in February, was designed \nto address chronic budget, schedule, and management difficulties.  DoD\u2019s senior leadership \nrecently approved a long-term, follow-on weather satellite program to NPOESS \u2013 the Defense \nWeather Satellite System (DWSS).  The Committee\u2019s reduction would significantly hinder the \nDepartment from taking the necessary steps to implement DWSS and to transition critical assets \nand data to NOAA, potentially resulting in future gaps in military and civil weather satellite \ncoverage.  The reduction could also result in terminating major elements of the existing program, \nimpairing development of NOAA\u2019s Joint Polar Satellite System program, and incurring an \notherwise avoidable termination liability for both DoD and Commerce.   \n \nNational Nuclear Security Administration Program Reductions:  The Administration objects to \nreductions to key weapons programs, including the W76 Life Extension, Plutonium \nInfrastructure Sustainment, Kansas City Responsive Infrastructure, Tritium Readiness, and \nFissile Materials Disposition programs.  Failure to provide the requested funding for these \nprograms would delay essential stockpile support and nuclear infrastructure modernization in \nsupport of the Nuclear Posture Review and would reduce NNSA\u2019s ability to attain the W76 Life \nExtension Program production rates needed to meet Navy requirements.   \n \nExpansion of the Defense Production Act:  The Administration objects to section 214, which  \nauthorizes the use of Defense Production Act Title III authorities to develop advanced \ntechnologies for ground vehicles without a determination that the industry involved is essential \nto the national defense and that government assistance is required for the production of the \nsystems and technologies.  Early stage development of advanced technologies for military \nvehicles is best addressed in the Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation title. \nIncremental and Full Funding:  The Administration is concerned that the committee is \nauthorizing incremental funding of military construction projects.  As a matter of fiscal \nprudence, the Administration encourages full funding of these programs, which is consistent with \nthe President\u2019s Budget.   \n \nCommission on Military Environmental Exposures:  The Administration objects to section 314, \ndirecting the President to establish a commission of non-federal scientific experts to develop \ncompensation decisions under controlling law and regulations for current and former members of \nthe armed forces and their dependents based on the potential for exposure to environmental \nhazards at military installations.  A commission made up of scientific experts should address \nscientific issues, while accountable government policy officials should make military and \nveterans benefits and entitlement recommendations.  Also, until exposures resulting in health \nimplications are established, it is premature to consider the issue of benefits and entitlements.  \nThe Administration would be pleased to work with the Congress in developing language that \nwould address this matter in a manner that will advance the science as well as promote additional \nprotection to our members and their dependents from such exposures.  \n \nContracts for Commercial Imaging Satellite Capacities:  The Administration objects to Section \n142, which requires that DoD only procure the capacity of commercial imagery satellites with \n1.5 meter telescopes after December 31, 2010.  The planned next generation of commercial \nimagery satellites will use a 1.1 meter aperture.  Since the commercial satellite industry does not \ncurrently build 1.5 meter satellites, this provision would require considerable additional \ngovernment investment, and is not required to meet defense or intelligence requirements.  \n3  Further, by stipulating a predetermined commercial solution, this provision could negatively \nimpact the commercial data providers, limit innovation in commercial technology, and increase \nthe risks on future government contracts for commercial data services.   \n \nIran.  The Administration strongly supports P.L. 111-195, the recently enacted comprehensive \nIran sanctions legislation, and is very concerned that a related section in S. 3454 (section 818) \ncould conflict with P.L.111-195.  The Administration urges that no new provisions on Iran be \nincluded in light of the comprehensiveness of the recently enacted sanctions legislation.  \n \nTroops to Teachers Program:  The Administration urges the Senate\u2019s support for the transfer of \nthe Troops to Teachers Program to DoD in FY 2011, as reflected in the President\u2019s Budget and \nDoD\u2019s legislative proposal to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and \nTitle 10 of the U.S. Code.  The move to Defense will help ensure that this important program \nsupporting members of the military as teachers is retained and provide better oversight of \nprogram outcomes by simplifying and streamlining program management.  The Administration \nlooks forward to keeping the Congress abreast of this transfer, to ensure it runs smoothly and has \nno adverse impact on program enrollees.   \n \nRestoration of Policy Regarding Use of Medical Facilities:  The Administration supports section \n713, which would restore a policy to ensure that servicewomen and military dependents \u2013 \nincluding nearly 50,000 servicewomen stationed overseas \u2013 have the ability to obtain abortion \nservices using their own, private funds. \n \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n4  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  May 24, 2010 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nHouse Amendment to Senate Amendment to  \nH.R. 4213 - American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act of 2010 \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of the House Amendment to the Senate \nAmendment to H.R. 4213.  Passage of this legislation will provide much-needed relief to \nfamilies, including extended access to health care benefits for workers who have lost their jobs \nand extended unemployment insurance benefits for millions of Americans who are looking for \nwork.  It will also provide critical assistance to hard-pressed States while encouraging continued \njob creation by America\u2019s businesses.  The importance of longer-term extensions for various \nauthorities and programs \u2013 and the certainty that such extensions bring \u2013 has been highlighted by \nthe severe problems caused by interruptions in authorities for these programs. \n \nThe House Amendment contains several important provisions, including:  (1) an extension of \nextended unemployment insurance and COBRA subsidies through the end of the year; (2) reform \nof the physician payment formula; (3) an extension of increased American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act (ARRA) Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rates that allow for \nadditional Federal support for State Medicaid programs; (4) an extension of the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) Emergency Fund to continue support for State-\nsubsidized employment programs for needy parents and youth, among other purposes; (5) an \nextension of ARRA subsidies so that the Small Business Administration can continue certain \nlending programs with reduced fees and higher guarantees; (6) additional resources to create \nsummer jobs for youth; (7) targeted pension-funding relief; and (8) extension of provisions that \nwill support affordable housing and create jobs. \n \nThe President has long supported comprehensive, fiscally responsible reform of the physician \npayment formula to improve the quality of care. The House Amendment provision represents \nsignificant progress toward that goal, and the Administration strongly supports its passage. \n \nThe Administration applauds the Congress for including provisions in the bill to fulfill the \nobligations set forth in the Cobell and Pigford II settlement agreements.  The settlements that \nhave been achieved are historic and provide full and final resolution to two long-running disputes \n\u2013 a case involving the management of individual Indian trust accounts related to Indian lands and \nclaims of prior discrimination brought by black farmers against the Department of Agriculture. \n \nThe bill also includes several other important measures supported by the Administration.  The \nextensions to expiring tax cuts include several provisions that will encourage companies to invest \nin new technologies and create more high-tech jobs for the 21st century, including extending the \nresearch and experimentation (R&E) tax credit for another year.  The legislation also extends the \ntax credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel, providing clean energy companies with the \ncertainty they need to make critical investments in the Nation\u2019s energy future.   \n  Finally, the House Amendment includes revenue-raising provisions similar to those included in \nthe President\u2019s budget, including proposals to close international tax loopholes that currently \nallow companies to shift profits among overseas jurisdictions to lower their U.S. taxes and a \nsensible proposal to make certain that investment managers pay taxes on their earnings at rates \ncloser to the ordinary income tax rates paid by other workers in the Nation\u2019s economy. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on these and \nadditional measures to spur private sector job creation, including measures focused on small \nbusinesses (including lending provisions, zero capital gains for small businesses and bonus \ndepreciation) and energy (including retrofits and an expansion of the 48C tax credit for \nmanufacturing).    \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nJuly 22, 2009 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3288 \u2014 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2010 \n(Rep. Obey, D-Wisconsin) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3288, making appropriations for \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2010. \n \nThe President believes that America\u2019s economic success in the 21st Century depends significantly \non a modernized infrastructure, from roads and highways to high-speed rail, inland waterways, and \nhousing.  These infrastructure investments will help build a new foundation for long-term \neconomic growth to benefit the American people for years to come. \n \nThe President requested, and the Committee approved, significant increases in 21st Century \ntransportation with new resources for the Nation\u2019s road, rail, and air transportation systems. The \nlegislation takes an important step toward modernizing what has become an outdated and over-\nstressed transportation network.  Importantly, the legislation not only invests in new systems, but \nalso works to improve the safety of those systems already in place.  Increased transit and air travel \nsafety dollars will result in fewer accidents and more lives saved.  \n \nAdditionally, the funding included in the legislation for housing and community development \nprograms can serve as important anchors to locally driven innovations.  With a strengthened safety \nnet for Americans facing significant hardship in these challenging economic times together with \nfunds dedicated to revitalizing local communities and expanding opportunities, this legislation will \nhelp the Nation\u2019s urban and rural areas alike.  These efforts are complimentary to the \nAdministration\u2019s desire to work with the Congress to launch the Housing Trust Fund, which would \nexpand the rental housing supply available for very low-income families. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nAdministration Priorities \n \nNational Infrastructure Bank and High Speed Rail.  The Administration appreciates the support \nfor up to $2 billion for a National Infrastructure Bank, an important Administration priority, and \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to authorize the Bank as soon as possible.  Once \nestablished, the Bank will play a key role in supporting regionally and nationally significant, high-\nvalue, multi-modal projects selected on the basis of merit.  The Administration also thanks the \nCommittee for capital grants for high-speed and intercity passenger rail corridor expansion.   \n  Combat Mortgage Fraud.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funds the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Combat Mortgage Fraud initiative, which will \nsupport a strong response to abusive practices that have taken advantage of home loan borrowers \nand contributed to financial market turmoil. \n \nCommunity Development Block Grant (CDBG).  While the Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s pledge to fully fund CDBG, the Administration strongly \nurges the Congress to consider reforms to the program, particularly modernizing the outdated \nfunding formula to target funds to economically distressed communities more effectively, resulting \nin increased accountability.   \n \nChoice Neighborhoods.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide $250 million requested \nfor Choice Neighborhoods, which would support the Administration\u2019s broader effort to fight \nconcentrated poverty and revitalize neighborhoods.   \n \nEfficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals. The Administration urges the Congress to support the \nPresident\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their usefulness, fund \nnarrowly focused activities, or duplicate existing programs, including the Rail Line Relocation \nProgram for which funds are not distributed through a need- or merit-based process and an \nalternative program achieves the same goal. \n \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) \n \nThe Administration is pleased that the Committee supports the President\u2019s request for DOT.  The \nAdministration appreciates the provision of capital funding for the Washington Metropolitan Area \nTransit Authority (WMATA), which will help WMATA to address safety shortfalls within its rail \nsystem.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the funding provided to \nthe Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Next Generation Air Transportation System. \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance, \nProject-Based Rental Assistance, and Public Housing programs.  This funding is especially \nimportant in light of the current economic environment.   \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to provide the full $100 million request for the Energy \nInnovation Fund to support local initiatives that remove barriers to efficiency and leverage private \nsector funds.  The Fund will allow for the identification of the most effective practices for \nreplication across the Nation, increasing the dividends of energy efficiency investments in \nhousing. \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for HUD\u2019s new Transformation \nInitiative, which sets aside funds for HUD to become a more innovative and accountable agency.  \nHowever, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the full $434 million in transfer \nauthority from HUD programs.

The Administration agrees with the sponsors of \nH.R. 2101 that the defense-acquisition process needs improvement in the areas of systems \nengineering, developmental test and evaluation, technological maturity, and cost estimation, and \nthat changes are needed to strengthen a culture of acquisition excellence in the Department of \nDefense.  The Administration is committed to making trade-offs among cost, schedule, and \nperformance to significantly reduce cost growth in major defense acquisition programs.  The \nAdministration wants to ensure that the defense acquisition process is free from conflicts of \ninterest and that the process supports the U.S. Government being a better steward of the \ntaxpayers' dollars.  The Administration believes that H.R. 2101, with some changes that we \nbelieve can satisfactorily be resolved, would enable the Administration to meet those objectives.  \n \n*  *  *  *  *  * \n \n \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMarch 19, 2010 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3590 \u2013 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  \nand \nH.R. 4872 \u2013 Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of health insurance reform legislation.  This \nlegislation makes significant improvements that will help to give American families and small \nbusiness owners more control of their own health care.  It makes important changes \u2013 ending the \nworst practices of insurance companies; giving uninsured individuals and small business owners \nthe same kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress have; and bringing \ndown the cost of health care for families and businesses while also reducing Federal budget \ndeficits.  \n \nThis legislation provides the necessary health reforms that the Administration seeks \u2013 affordable, \nquality care within reach for the tens of millions of Americans who do not have it today by \nproviding the largest tax cut for health care in history and prohibiting insurance companies from \ndenying coverage to the millions of Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.  It also \nbrings new stability and security for the hundreds of millions who already have insurance by \nreining in the worst insurance industry abuses and putting in place reforms that increase \ntransparency, improve the quality of care, and contain health care costs.  This legislation \ncontributes to transforming the health care system to make health care more accessible and \naffordable for the American people.  It also includes provisions that would eliminate wasteful \nsubsidies for student loan lenders and invest these savings to fortify the Pell Grant program and \nincrease Pell Grants for millions of students; strengthen community colleges; strengthen \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority-Serving Institutions; and allow \nstudents to cap student loan payments at affordable levels.

The Administration appreciates that \nUSDA\u2019s renewable energy, small business programs, and food safety programs are funded at the \nrequested level. \n \nEfficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration encourages the Congress to support \nthe President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their usefulness, fund \nnarrowly focused activities, or duplicate existing programs, such as public broadcast grants to help  the digital conversion.  The FY 2010 Budget proposed to support public broadcasting through the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and eliminate the duplicative USDA Public Broadcast \nGrants program.  The Administration urges the Congress to accept this termination since digital \nconversion is largely complete and CPB has funding that can be used to complete any remaining \nconversion needs. \n \nFood Safety and Inspection Service   \n \nThe Administration is concerned with section 744 of the bill which deals with food safety issues.  \nThe Administration would like to work with the Congress to address the issues raised by the \nCommittee in a manner that would protect the Nation\u2019s food supply and be consistent with \ninternational trade obligations. \n \nFood and Nutrition Service \n \nThe Administration is pleased with the Committee\u2019s support for strengthening nutrition assistance \nprograms by including funding for food banks, community-based food providers, fully funding \nWIC, and by supporting a pilot initiative to help increase elderly participation in the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program. \n \nFarm Service Agency \n \nThe Administration appreciates the funding provided for the Farm Service Agency\u2019s Information \nTechnology Modernization, which will allow the agency to continue modernizing its antiquated \ninformation technology systems.  \n \nRural Development \n \nThe Administration appreciates that the majority of Rural Development programs are funded at the \nPresident\u2019s requested levels.  However, funding for the Rental Assistance Grants falls $111 million \nshort of the estimate needed to renew the expiring rental assistance contracts expected in FY 2010.  \n \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) \n \nThe Administration appreciates that the Committee provides the requested increase to strengthen \nFDA\u2019s efforts to make food and medical products safer.  The requested funding will allow FDA to \nwork with domestic and foreign industries to develop new control measures for all levels of the \nsupply chain, improve and increase risk-based inspections, and respond more effectively with \nrapid and targeted product tracing when problems do occur. \n \nInvesting in the Basic Sciences and Agricultural Research   \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s goal of investing in \nthe basic agricultural sciences.

The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the \nPresident\u2019s goal of increasing access to broadband.  However, the President\u2019s request provided an \nincrease in loan funding which the Committee moves into grants, resulting in a decrease in loan \nsupport of $132 million.  This reduction will slow expansion of broadband into rural America. \n \nRural Revitalization.  The FY 2010 Budget requested an increase of $70 million for rural \nrevitalization grants.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee provides less than \n$10 million of the requested increase, including no increase for Secondary and Post-Secondary \nEducation, Institution Challenge Grants, or the Quality of Life Program. \n \nRenewable Energy.  The Administration appreciates the support the Committee has provided to the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Rural Business programs.  However, the \nAdministration urges the Congress to fund the Rural Energy for America program at the full  requested amount.  This program is necessary in promoting energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy in rural communities. \n \nEfficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support \nfor some of the President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce USDA programs that have outlived \ntheir usefulness, such as public broadcast grants to help the digital conversion, or that are \nduplicative of other USDA programs, such as high-cost energy grants.  The Administration \nencourages the Congress to reconsider other proposals made by the Administration that would \nbetter target scarce resources and eliminate duplicative programs.  \n \nFood Safety and Inspection Service \n \nThe Administration is concerned with sections 723 and 724 of the bill which deal with food safety \nissues.

Once completed, the multi-year \nstabilization and modernization plan, dubbed \u201cMIDAS,\u201d will allow the agency to provide program \nbenefits in a more efficient, accurate, and responsive manner. \n \nRural Development \n \nThe Administration appreciates that the Committee funds the majority of Rural Development at \nthe President\u2019s requested levels.  However, funding for the Rental Assistance Grants falls $77 \nmillion short of the estimate needed to renew the expiring rental assistance contracts expected in \nFY 2010.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the full request of $1.1 billion, which \nwill continue the support of rents for USDA-financed properties on behalf of the tenants who \nreceive subsidized rent.  \n \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) \n \nThe Administration appreciates that the Committee provides the request to strengthen the FDA\u2019s \nefforts to make food and medical products safer.

It meets the President\u2019s criteria for health insurance reform:  it \nassures that all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care that is there when they \nneed it and does so without adding a dime to the deficit. \n \nThis legislation is the product of unprecedented cooperation and countless hours of hard work by \nMembers of the House of Representatives who share the President\u2019s conviction that the Nation \ncannot wait another year for health insurance reform.  They have forged a strong consensus that \nrepresents an historic step forward.  \n \nThe House legislation includes critical reforms to the insurance industry, so that Americans will \nno longer have to worry that they will be denied coverage, or that their coverage will be dropped \nor watered down when they need it most.  It covers virtually all Americans and ensures that all \nAmericans with health insurance are protected against high out-of-pocket spending.  The \nAdministration is pleased that the bill includes a public health insurance option offered in an \nexchange.

Obey (D) Wisconsin) \n \n  The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 2346, the Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, 2009, which will fund our ongoing military, diplomatic, and intelligence \noperations, as well as provide emergency funding to support the response to the 2009-H1N1 \ninfluenza outbreak.  We face a security situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan that demands \nurgent attention.  The Taliban is resurgent and al Qaeda continues to operate from its safe haven \nalong the Afghan-Pakistan border.  The Administration urges the Congress to move \nexpeditiously to approve this funding to help the people of Iraq take responsibility for their own \nfuture and work to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n \nDefense Matters \n \n  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the ongoing military, \ndiplomatic, and intelligence operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \nEnduring Freedom.  The bill also provides improved protection to our forces against the threat of \nImprovised Explosive Devices and increased funding to provide wounded servicemembers with \nthe highest quality care.  The Administration appreciates Congress\u2019 efforts to pass this \nlegislation as quickly as possible, as our military services will have to begin adjusting their day-\nto-day activities if this legislation is not passed by Memorial Day. \n \nForeign Operations Matters \n \n  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided funding for the President\u2019s \ninternational affairs priorities, including the necessary funding for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and \nIraq.  In addition, the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for our efforts to assist \nthe Palestinian people, bolster the Mexican government\u2019s efforts to combat drug trafficking and \norganized crime, meet humanitarian needs worldwide, and help address the impact of the global \nfinancial crisis in developing countries.  \n \n  However, the Administration is concerned about the omission of authorizations for the \nContributions to Multilateral Development Banks.  The Administration urges the House to \ninclude language authorizing the 15th Replenishment for the International Development \nAssociation (IDA15) and 11th Replenishment for the African Development Fund (AfDF11). \nThese authorizations are necessary for the United States to meet its international commitments to \nthese institutions and to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), as well as to maintain \nleadership as we push for management reforms at both banks.   The Congress provided funds for  these institutions in P.L. 111-8, the \"Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009.\"  Without the necessary \nauthorizations, Treasury cannot make the IDA15 payment before June 30, 2009, and the United \nStates will fall farther behind in meeting its MDRI commitment. \n \n2009-H1N1 Influenza \n \n  The Administration appreciates the Committee's inclusion of additional resources to \nrespond to the current 2009-H1N1 influenza outbreak and to prepare for a possible future \npandemic influenza.  The Administration also commends the Committee for providing some \nflexibility within the resources to address the 2009-H1N1 outbreak.  Out of an abundance of \ncaution, the President requested $1.5 billion and flexibility to enhance our Nation\u2019s capability to \nrespond domestically and internationally.  The Administration believes that the unpredictable \noutbreak merits appropriation of funds to a new account in the Executive Office of the President \nfor a Federal-wide assessment and coordination of the resources to respond to this situation. \n \nOther Matters \n \n  The Administration appreciates that no earmarks are included in the bill, and that \nemergency funding was limited to non-recurring costs such as wildland fire management and the \ninfluenza outbreak. \n \n* * * * * \n \n \n \n2  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  May 5, 2010  \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n  H.R. 5019 - Home Star Energy Retrofit Act of 2010 \n  (Rep.

These investments are designed to further new solutions to \ncreate new industries and new opportunities for Americans for decades to come. \n \nThis bill invests in the sciences, encouraging innovative technologies that will be central to the \nNation\u2019s energy independence.  The legislation makes long overdue commitments to improved \ninfrastructure, focusing on high-return investments and the reliable operation of those facilities \nthat are of central importance to the Nation.  Additionally, and importantly, the legislation follows \nthrough on the Nation\u2019s commitments to the Gulf Coast region, still recovering from historic \nstorms from years past, and works to prevent such devastation from future storms. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \n \nAdministration Priorities \n \nOffice of Science.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the Department of \nEnergy\u2019s Office of Science, a key component of the President\u2019s Plan for Science and Innovation.  \nThe level would maintain the President\u2019s proposed path to double funding for this office over 10 \nyears. \n \nLos Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nsupport for cancellation of the planned refurbishment of LANSCE, which was built 30 years ago \nand no longer plays a critical role in weapons research.  The Administration also appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s recognition of the need to analyze alternatives for the future of LANSCE. \n \nDepartment of Energy \n \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Administration urges the Congress to \nrestore $68 million for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The research and \ndevelopment of solar energy and building technologies are two areas where investments can make \nlarge contributions toward a clean energy economy.   \n  Energy Innovation Hubs and RE-ENERGYSE.  The Administration strongly urges support for the \nEnergy Innovations Hubs and RE-ENERGYSE.  The Hubs will advance highly promising areas of \nenergy science and technology from their early stages and RE-ENERGYSE will encourage tens of \nthousands of American students to pursue careers in science, engineering, and entrepreneurship \nrelated to clean energy.   \n \nOffice of Nuclear Energy.  The Administration is concerned with the Committee\u2019s reallocation of \nfunds among nuclear energy programs because it reduces the critical investment in longer-term \nresearch and development, undermining the goal of building a solid foundation for the long-term \nuse of safe and secure nuclear power. \n \nEnergy Information Agency.  The Administration urges the Congress to restore funds to allow the \nEnergy Information Agency to undertake important energy analysis and statistical work, such as \ngathering critical information to understand energy use and the performance of Federal energy \nefficiency programs and to improve the statistical reliability of home energy use data. \n \nPower Marketing Administrations.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee adopted \nthe proposal to reclassify power receipts from mandatory to discretionary to offset the annual \nexpenses of the Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Power Administrations.  This will allow \nfor better operations and maintenance planning and execution, leading to a more reliable power \nsystem. \n \nNational Nuclear Security Administration.  The elimination of the $65 million funding for the B61 \nrefurbishment study in FY 2010 will cancel refurbishment activities associated with replacing the \nB61 end-of-life components.  Without refurbishment of these components, the sustainment of the \nB61 bomb family, a key component of our deterrence strategy, will be in jeopardy. \n \nCorps of Engineers (Corps) \n \nThe Administration supports the funding level provided to operate and maintain existing Corps \nprojects and the inclusion of a $19.5 million reserve to address key emergency maintenance and \nrepair needs.  The Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s continued efforts to advance \nlegislation that will produce sufficient revenue to meet the established cost-sharing for inland \nwaterways capital investments. \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of the South Florida ecosystem \nrestoration program and its recognition that each of the activities in this program is part of a single, \nongoing, integrated Federal ecosystem restoration effort.  The Congress is urged to fully fund the \nModified Water Deliveries to Everglades National Park project. \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to restore the requested $41 million for a base annual level \nof funding needed to prepare for floods and other natural disasters in lieu of continuing to provide \nthese funds through periodic supplemental appropriations.  The Administration also welcomes the \nCommittee\u2019s support of funding to begin work on the Water Resources Priorities study, a high-\npriority interagency evaluation of the Nation\u2019s vulnerability to flooding. \n \nReprogramming Provisions \n \nSections 101 and 201 of the bill contain restrictions on the reprogramming of funds that present \n2  significant management challenges for the Department of the Interior and the Corps of Engineers \nin the execution of their responsibilities.

Small \nbusinesses are the backbone of the American economy and where most new jobs begin.   \n   \nThe Senate substitute amendment includes several important proposals.  First, it would establish a \nState Small Business Credit Initiative that would support new lending through innovative State-based \nprograms at a time when States are being forced to cut back on them due to budget shortfalls.  \nSecond, it includes several enhancements to Small Business Administration (SBA) loan programs \nthat the Administration strongly supports.  These enhancements include increases in the size limits \nfor SBA loans, a temporary allowance for commercial real estate refinancings under their 504 loan \nguarantee program, as well as the extension of Recovery Act provisions for higher loan guarantees \nand temporary fee eliminations.  Third, it includes a critical clarification to small business \ncontracting law to clarify and reiterate the Congress\u2019s original intent not to prioritize one small \nbusiness development program over another.

They contribute to transforming the health care system to make health \ncare more accessible and affordable for the American people.

The Administration also supports appropriate changes to facilitate \ncost-neutral loan modifications for federally guaranteed rural housing loans and FHA loans.   \n \nIn the context of the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, the Administration supports \ngiving servicers appropriate authority and incentives to make loan modifications that are \naffordable.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that any \nsafe harbor, if necessary, provides appropriate authority and incentives for lenders and servicers \nto make loan modifications that are affordable to at-risk homeowners, and also provides \nappropriate contractual protections that encourage mortgage financing in the future.  Similarly, \nthe Administration supports the creation of a nationwide Mortgage Fraud Task Force to address \nmortgage fraud and deter and prosecute those people responsible for mortgage rescue fraud \nschemes, but recommends that the definition of mortgage fraud be revised to include all \nmortgage-related fraud perpetrated against borrowers. \n \nThe Administration supports making permanent the increase of Federal deposit insurance \ncoverage to $250,000 for insured depository institutions (i.e., banks, thrifts, and credit unions) \nand increasing the ability of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit \nUnion Administration to borrow from the Treasury Department.  The Administration is \nsupportive of the Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund only as a temporary \nmeasure to address challenges with the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to make changes to improve the \nShare Insurance Fund\u2019s ability to better manage all liquidation payments and the impact those \npayments have on the credit union industry. \n \nThe Administration also supports appropriately tailored bankruptcy legislation to provide a \nmechanism for homeowners who are out of other options to file for bankruptcy and implement a \nresponsible plan to pay the debts that they are able to pay.  Notwithstanding the Senate vote on \nthe Durbin Amendment, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to \naddress this issue.    \n \n*  *  *  *  *  *  *   ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJune 6, 2012 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5855 \u2014 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5855, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2013, and for \nother purposes.   \n \nLast summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on \na sustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  The BCA created \na framework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that \nwould bring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national \npriorities.  Departing from the bipartisan agreement reached in the BCA and departing from \nthese caps, the House of Representatives put forward a topline discretionary funding level for \nFY 2013 that, for example, would cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially seniors, \nveterans, and children \u2013 as well as degrade many of the basic Government services on which the \nAmerican people rely such as air traffic control and law enforcement.  In addition, these cuts \nwere made in the context of a budget that fails the test of balance, fairness, and shared \nresponsibility by giving millionaires and billionaires a tax cut and paying for it through deep \ncuts, including to discretionary programs. \n \nTaking this into account, passing H.R. 5855 at its current funding level would mean that when \nthe Congress constructs other appropriations bills, it would necessitate significant and harmful \ncuts to critical national priorities such as education, research and development, job training, and \nhealth care.  Furthermore, the bill undermines key investments in homeland security, including \ncuts to aviation security activities, reductions to critical grant programs, and elimination of key \nconsolidation efforts to improve operations across Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \nenterprise operations.  Investing in these areas is critical to the Nation's economic growth, \nsecurity, and global competitiveness.  The Administration also strongly objects to the inclusion \nof ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5855, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nTransportation Security Administration.  The Administration objects to the bill's failure to \nreform the aviation passenger security fee as proposed in the FY 2013 Budget.  The \nAdministration is also concerned that funding for the Federal Air Marshals is cut by $50 million \nbelow the FY 2013 Budget request, which will result in reduced coverage on high-risk flights. \n \nState and Local Grant Programs.  The Administration objects to the Committee's failure to \ninclude the proposed National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP).  NPGP is designed to \ndevelop, sustain, and leverage core capabilities across the United States in support of national  preparedness, prevention, and response.  The Administration appreciates that the bill continues \nthe flexibility provided to the Secretary of Homeland Security to award grants, as authorized in \nFY 2012. \n \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  The Administration opposes the \nCommittee's decision to fund 1,200 unrequested detention beds while reducing funds requested \nfor ICE's Alternatives to Detention program, which helps ensure that low-risk individuals in \nremoval proceedings appear for hearings and comply with removal orders, all at a lower per-day \ncost than detention.  The Administration objects to the funding provided above the FY 2013 \nBudget request for the 287(g) program, since Secure Communities is more consistent, efficient, \nand cost-effective in identifying and removing criminal and other priority aliens than the 287(g) \nprogram.  The Administration also objects to a statutory funding floor for worksite enforcement, \nwhich would limit ICE's ability to address emerging criminal trends and prevent ICE from \nreallocating investigatory resources based on threat and risk. \n \nDepartmental Management Initiatives.  The Administration opposes the lack of funding for two \nkey management initiatives at DHS: continued investments for the St. Elizabeths Headquarters \nConsolidation project; and funding for DHS Data Center Consolidation.  Both of these initiatives \nare necessary to strengthen DHS operations and increase efficiency in future years. \n \nCybersecurity.  The Administration appreciates the support the bill provides for cybersecurity \ninitiatives including the EINSTEIN program and a new initiative to continuously monitor \nFederal networks for malicious cyber activity. \n \nIncremental Funding.  The Administration opposes the use of incremental funding for the Coast \nGuard's National Security Cutter program.  Although the Administration supports the underlying \nshipbuilding programs, the use of incremental funding rather than the full funding requested for \nFY 2013 undermines program stability and long-term cost discipline. \n \nTransfer of US-VISIT.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not include the \nAdministration's proposal to transfer portions of the US-VISIT program to U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection (CBP).  Currently CBP operates numerous screening and targeting systems, \nand integrating US-VISIT activities within CBP would strengthen the Department's overall \nvetting capability while also realizing efficiencies and savings.  The bill instead places US-VISIT \nwithin the National Protection and Programs Directorate without achieving operational \nefficiencies or cost savings, hampering the Department's efforts to improve program \neffectiveness. \n \nDisaster Relief Fund.  The Administration appreciates the funding level provided in the bill for \nthe Disaster Relief Fund, including $608 million for base program activity and $5.5 billion \nprovided as a disaster relief cap adjustment made pursuant to the BCA.  This funding should be \nsufficient to support the Nation's response to emergencies and major disasters and to provide \nongoing aid to disaster survivors. \nImmigrant Integration Grants.  The Administration appreciates the $9.2 million in fee-based \nfunding provided to administer the citizenship and immigrant integration grant program at U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services, and encourages the Congress to fund these efforts through \ndiscretionary appropriations, as requested in the FY 2013 Budget.      \n \nCivilian Pay Freeze.  The Administration objects to efforts to reduce pay for civilian personnel \nthat would effectively extend the freeze on civilian pay through FY 2013.  As the President \n2  stated in his FY 2013 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.  The \nAdministration encourages the Congress to support the proposed 0.5 percent pay raise. \n \nFacilitating Trade and Travel.  The Administration underscores its concern that the bill does not \ninclude the Administration's proposal for additional authority for U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection (CBP) to enter into public-private partnerships, which would enable CBP to expand \nand expedite the throughput of travelers and cargo to and from the United States.  The \nAdministration proposed this authority to provide additional flexibility for augmenting safe and \nsecure processing capacity to increase travel and trade to the United States. \n \nRiders \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders that have no place \nin funding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill: \n \nAbortion-Related Provisions.  Sections 566, 567, and 568 purport to limit the use of Federal \nfunds for providing or facilitating abortion services.  Longstanding Federal policy prohibits \nFederal funds from being used for these services, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life \nof the woman would be endangered.  Current DHS practice does not compel employees to \nperform or facilitate them, or permit Federal funds to be used to acquire these services except in \ncases where a pregnancy is the result of rape, incest, or threatens the life of the woman.  \n \nConstitutional Concerns  \n \nThe Administration strongly objects to and has constitutional concerns about the provisions of \nsection 533 that limit the use of funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee \ntransfers.  Although the Administration opposes the release of detainees within the United States, \nsection 533 undermines our national security and raises significant separation of powers \nconcerns.  This provision unnecessarily constrains the Nation's counterterrorism efforts, \nparticularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 option for incapacitating \ndangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have leveraged the \nflexibility and strength of this country\u2019s Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous terrorists and \ngather critical intelligence.  The continued prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an \nessential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available \noption.  Such restrictions or interferences would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional \nseparation of powers principles.   \n \nAdditionally, Section 512 purports to prevent funds from being used to exercise supervisory \ncontrol over preparation of certain reports by the Privacy Officer of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.  This provision implicates separation of powers concerns by imposing a potentially \nmaterial practical burden on the President's effective supervision and management of the \nExecutive Branch.  The Administration urges that it be deleted.  Finally, Sections 547 and 550 \nboth raise concerns under the Recommendations Clause, because they purport to constrain the \nsubstance of the President's or other executive officers' budget proposals. The Administration \nalso urges that these provisions be deleted. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n3  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n \nDecember 8, 2011 \n(Senate) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nS. 1931 \u2013 Temporary Tax Holiday and Government Reduction Act \n(Sen. Heller, R-Nevada) \n \nIn the American Jobs Act, the President proposed to continue and expand the payroll tax cut in \nplace this year to help provide relief to working families and boost the economy.  Passage of S. \n1944, the Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2011, would enact these tax cuts into law and fully pay \nfor them, in part by asking the Nation's wealthiest to contribute a small percentage more.  \n \nThe Administration recognizes that S. 1931 would at least continue this year's payroll tax \ncut.  However, the Administration opposes S. 1931 because, by contrast to S. 1944, it provides \none-third less tax relief for America's workers and is paid for by unbalanced cuts that would \nbreak a bipartisan deal achieved in August and would undermine the Nation's ability to invest in \nareas that are key to America's future, to maintain core government functions, and to defend the \nUnited States.     \n \nIf the Congress does nothing, the typical working family earning $50,000 will see its taxes go up \nby $1,000.  Under the American Jobs Act and S. 1944, that family's tax cut would be increased \nfrom $1,000 to $1,500.  By contrast, S. 1931 does not expand the current payroll tax cut at all, \nthus providing one-third less tax relief to 160 million American workers.   \n \nWhile S. 1944 proposes to fully pay for the tax cuts in a balanced and fair way, S. 1931 would \nalmost entirely pay for the payroll tax cuts by breaking the bipartisan deal achieved in the Budget \nControl Act.  It would add new cuts on top of the $1 trillion in reductions to defense and non-\ndefense spending under the Budget Control Act and the additional $1.2 trillion in cuts that could \nautomatically go into place because of the failure of the Joint Committee on Deficit \nReduction.  The additional spending cuts under S. 1931 would mean further reductions in areas \nlike education and energy, reducing core government functions ranging from services for this \nNation's veterans to border security, and further cutting back spending on the Nation's defense.  \n \nThe President is committed to providing tax relief to America's workers next year and fully \npaying for this relief in a way that is fair.  The Administration strongly supports S. 1944 and \nopposes S. 1931. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMay 26, 2011 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 990 \u2013 PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011  \n \nThe Administration strongly supports the enactment of S. 990, which reauthorizes through June \n1, 2015, three critical authorities that our Nation's intelligence and law enforcement agencies \nneed to protect our national security.

This prohibition is maintained in the Affordable \nCare Act and reinforced through the President\u2019s Executive Order 13535.  H.R. 3 goes well \nbeyond these safeguards by interfering with consumers\u2019 private health care choices.  The \nAdministration also strongly supports existing provider conscience laws that have protected the \nrights of health care providers and entities for over 30 years, and it recognizes and supports the \nrights of patients.

Gingrey, R-GA, and 134 cosponsors) \n \nThe Affordable Care Act made significant improvements to our Nation\u2019s health care system, \nincluding creating the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB).  The fifteen expert \nmembers of the Board, which will include doctors and patient advocates, will recommend to the \nCongress policies that reduce the rate of Medicare growth and help Medicare provide better care \nat lower costs.  IPAB has been highlighted by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, \neconomists, and health policy experts as an important contributor to Medicare\u2019s long-term \nsustainability.  The Board is prohibited from recommending changes to Medicare that ration \nhealth care, restrict benefits, modify eligibility, increase cost sharing, or raise premiums or \nrevenues.  Under current law, the Congress retains the authority to modify, reject, or enhance \nIPAB recommendations to strengthen Medicare, and IPAB recommendations would take effect \nonly if the Congress does not act to slow Medicare cost growth. \n \nH.R. 5 would repeal and dismantle the IPAB even before it has a chance to work.  The bill would \neliminate an important safeguard that, under current law, will help reduce the rate of Medicare \ncost growth responsibly while protecting Medicare beneficiaries and the traditional program.  \nThe Administration strongly opposes legislation that attempts to erode the important provisions \nof the Affordable Care Act. \n \nAdditionally, the Administration has serious concerns with key aspects of medical malpractice \nprovisions included in H.R. 5.  The goals of medical malpractice reform should be to provide fair \nand prompt compensation to patients who have been harmed by medical negligence, reduce \npreventable injuries, improve the quality of care, reduce defensive medicine, and lower medical \nliability premiums.  However, H.R. 5 would establish inappropriate and harmful restrictions on \nhealth care lawsuits without effectively meeting these goals.  Specifically, the Administration \nopposes placing artificial caps on malpractice awards which will prevent patients and other \nclaimants who have been wrongfully harmed from receiving just compensation.   \n \nThe Administration is committed to strengthening Medicare, protecting patients, and supporting \nthe physicians who care for them.

Rogers (R) MI) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's support of the \nwork and efforts of the Intelligence Community (IC) and supports many provisions contained in \nH.R. 754.  However, the Administration has a number of concerns with the bill, which are \nhighlighted below, and looks forward to working with the Congress to address them.   \n \nThe Administration strongly urges the Congress to reverse the reduction and realignment of \nresources (including to personnel levels) proposed in the Classified Annex and the Classified \nSchedule of Authorizations to the bill and requests that the Congress authorize all funding as \nappropriated, as well as all requested personnel levels.  The directed reductions and redirection \nof resources at this late point in the fiscal year would effectively make unavailable over $200 \nmillion of already appropriated funds for critical intelligence capabilities.    \n \n\u2022  First, cuts to requested funding and personnel levels will have a seriously negative effect \non essential IC national security operations, including counter-terrorism and proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction analysis and counterintelligence \u2013 all critical, high \npriority needs.  The reductions would result in less capability than exists today.  The \nAdministration opposes the reductions in personnel levels below what was funded in the \nFY 2011 Appropriations Act and urges the Congress to authorize those funds as \nappropriated.    \n\u2022  Second, significant redirection of funds below the funding level enacted in the FY 2011 \nAppropriations Act from a technical collection program will negatively impact an \nacquisition that is successfully achieving acquisition milestones.  This action comes at a \ntime when the IC is conducting a Congressionally-requested assessment of an alternative \nto the Administration\u2019s program.  Until that assessment is complete, a significant \nreduction or redirection of funds is unwarranted and will likely jeopardize the scheduled \noperational capability of this critical national security collection system. \n \nAdditional details are set out in a classified views letter from the Director of National \nIntelligence (DNI) to the intelligence oversight committees, dated 12 April 2011.   \n \nSection 402 requires the DNI to create an insider threat detection program for the information \nresources of each element of the IC to detect unauthorized access to classified information.  The \nAdministration wholeheartedly agrees with the need to be vigilant and proactive in trying to \ndetect, mitigate, and deter insider threats, and supports a comprehensive insider threat detection \ncapability.  The Administration is currently working toward its implementation.  However, the \nAdministration is concerned with the unrealistic timelines required by this provision for the \nprogram\u2019s operational readiness, and strongly requests that the provision be amended to grant the \nDNI flexibility in implementation timelines of the program.   \nThe Administration urges the inclusion with certain modifications of Section 412, which would \nhelp facilitate the auditability of Defense intelligence agencies by providing the Secretary of \nDefense with additional transfer authority for appropriations.  Deletion of this section will \nimpede the IC\u2019s ability to meet the Congressionally-mandated goal of auditable financial \nstatements. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nFebruary 28, 2012 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1837 \u2013 Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act \n(Rep. Nunes, R-California, and 2 cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1837, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Water \nReliability Act because the bill would unravel decades of work to forge consensus, solutions, and \nsettlements that equitably address some of California's most complex water challenges. \nH.R. 1837 would undermine five years of collaboration between local, State, and Federal \nstakeholders to develop the Bay-Delta Conservation Plan.  It would codify 20-year old, outdated \nscience as the basis for managing California's water resources, resulting in inequitable treatment \nof one group of water users over another.  And, contrary to 100 years of reclamation law that \nexhibits congressional deference to State water law, the bill would preempt California water law. \nThe bill also would reject the long-standing principle that beneficiaries should pay both the cost \nof developing water supplies and of mitigating any resulting development impacts, and would \nexacerbate current water shortages by repealing water pricing reforms that provide incentives for \ncontractors to conserve water supplies. \nFinally, H.R. 1837 would repeal the San Joaquin River Settlement Agreement, which the \nCongress enacted to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation.  Repeal of the settlement \nagreement would likely result in the resumption of costly litigation, creating an uncertain future \nfor river restoration and water delivery operations for all water users on the San Joaquin River. \nThe Administration strongly supports efforts to provide a more reliable water supply for \nCalifornia and to protect, restore, and enhance the overall quality of the Bay-Delta environment.  \nThe Administration has taken great strides toward achieving these co-equal goals through a \ncoordinated Federal Action Plan, which has strengthened collaboration between Federal agencies \nand the State of California while achieving solid results.

The Nation\u2019s outdated tax laws \ncurrently provide the oil and gas industry billions of dollars per year in these subsidies, even \nthough the industry is reporting outsized profits.  Furthermore, heads of the major oil companies \nhave in the past made it clear that high oil prices provide more than enough profit motive to \ninvest in domestic exploration and production without special tax breaks.  In making the tough \nchoices necessary for deficit reduction, the Nation simply cannot afford these wasteful subsidies, \nand that is why the President has proposed to eliminate them in his past three budgets as well as \nin his framework for business tax reform.  This money can be better spent promoting domestic \nmanufacturing, encouraging the development of clean energy technologies that will reduce our \ndependence on oil, and cutting the deficit.   \n \nIn addition, S. 2204 is consistent with elements of the President\u2019s Budget such as the \nreauthorization of the section 48C advanced energy manufacturing credit and the extension of \nthe section 1603 program.  Together, these important provisions support projects that will \nincrease the Nation\u2019s production of domestic clean energy and encourage investment in factories \nthat will manufacture cutting-edge energy technologies here in the United States.  There is no \nsilver bullet when it comes to high gas prices, which is why the Administration has consistently \nadvocated for an \u201call-of-the-above\u201d approach when it comes to the Nation\u2019s energy policy.

Undercutting funding for these radio stations, notably \nones in rural areas where such outlets are already scarce, would result in communities losing \nvaluable programming, and some stations could be forced to shut down altogether.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMay 5, 2011 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1230 \u2013 Restarting American Offshore Leasing Now Act \n(Rep.

Hastings, R-WA, and 70 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas \nproduction as part of a broad energy strategy that will protect consumers and reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.  Safety and environmental reforms that the Administration \nimplemented in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill are critical to achieving those \nobjectives.  These reforms strengthen requirements for issues ranging from well design to \nworkplace safety to corporate accountability, and they require operators to show that they can \ncontain a subsea oil spill like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The Administration opposes         \nH.R. 1230 and H.R. 1229, as reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources, both of \nwhich would undercut these critical reforms.  \n \nH.R. 1230 would undermine the Administration's work to ensure that environmental analysis \nrequired by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is conducted in a rigorous manner.  \nH.R. 1230 would hastily open areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic to leasing, including \nrequiring the Department of the Interior (DOI) to hold three lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico \nusing outdated NEPA analysis that was conducted before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The \nAdministration has strengthened NEPA analysis in light of lessons learned from the spill.  DOI \nintends to hold all three Gulf of Mexico lease sales referenced in the bill by mid-2012.     \n \nH.R. 1229 would constrain the ability of DOI to ensure that permits meet safety standards by \nrequiring permitting decisions to be made within 30 days of receiving an application \u2013 thereby \ncurtailing the review period.  Two 15 day extensions would be possible, though DOI would be \nrequired to submit burdensome justifications.  The bill would grant permits automatically at the \nend of this 60 day window, regardless of whether the applicant satisfied safety standards.  The \nAdministration believes these statutory time constraints are unwarranted.  Fifty-one new shallow \nwater permits have been issued since the Administration\u2019s stronger safety standards were put in \nplace, and deepwater permit applications also are being processed in a timely manner.  Since the \nend of February, when industry first demonstrated to safety regulators the capability to contain a \nsubsea spill, twelve deepwater wells have been permitted. \n \nH.R. 1229 would also require the Secretary of the Interior to grant an automatic one-year \nsuspension of leases (effectively extending the term of the lease) in the Gulf of Mexico.  The \nAdministration fully supports suspensions for Gulf of Mexico leaseholders directly impacted by \nthe drilling moratorium.  Ten such suspensions have already been granted using administrative \nprocedures to leaseholders who demonstrated that they were affected by the moratoria. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  May 23, 2011 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1216 \u2013 Converting Funding for Graduate Medical Education in Qualified Teaching \nHealth Centers from Direct Appropriations to an Authorization of Appropriations \n(Rep. Guthrie, R-KY) \n \nThe Affordable Care Act made significant improvements to our Nation\u2019s health care system that \nare helping to improve individuals' health and give American families and small business owners \nmore control of their own health care.  These important changes include: ending the worst \npractices of insurance companies; giving uninsured individuals and small business owners the \nsame kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress have; and bringing \ndown the cost of health care for families and businesses while also reducing Federal budget \ndeficits.  \n \nAs the President indicated in the State of the Union, the Administration is eager to work with the \nCongress to improve the Affordable Care Act by making care better or more affordable.  H.R. \n1216 does not advance the key objectives of the Affordable Care Act or offer alternative \nsolutions for meeting these important objectives.  Rather than making refinements to improve the \nlaw, the bill simply proposes to convert the Affordable Care Act's appropriations for graduate \nmedical education in qualified teaching health centers to an authorization of appropriations, and \nrescind unobligated balances.  These funds promote training of medical residents in qualifying \nhealth centers, strengthening the health care workforce, and supporting an increased number of \nprimary care medical and dental residents trained in community-based settings across the \ncountry.   \n \nThe Administration will continue to work with the Congress to responsibly implement the \nAffordable Care Act.  However, the Administration will strongly oppose legislation that attempts \nto erode the important provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are making health care more \naffordable and accessible for all Americans. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  July 7, 2011 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1309 \u2013 Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2011 \n(Rep.

The bill provides improved \nprotection for American taxpayers by requiring FEMA to use actuarial principles in determining \nfull flood risk rates for certain properties.

Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5856, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.  \n \nLast summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on a \nsustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  The BCA created a \nframework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that would \nbring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national priorities.  \nConsistent with last summer's budget agreement, the FY 2013 Budget request provides the resources \nthat the Department of Defense (DOD) needs to effectively meet the Nation's security requirements.  \nBy adding unrequested funding for defense, the House of Representatives departs from the bipartisan \nunderstanding reached a year ago.  Upending the balance in the BCA has negative consequences that \nwill, for example, cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially seniors, veterans, and children \u2013 as \nwell as degrade many of the basic Government services on which the American people rely such as air \ntraffic control and law enforcement.  In addition, these cuts were made in the context of a budget that \nfails the test of balance, fairness, and shared responsibility by giving millionaires and billionaires a tax \ncut and paying for it through deep cuts, including to discretionary programs. \n \nTaking this into account, passing H.R. 5856 at its current funding level would mean that when the \nCongress constructs other appropriations bills, it would necessitate significant and harmful cuts to \ncritical national priorities such as education, research and development, job training, and health care.  \nFurthermore, the bill undermines key investments in high-priority programs, impeding the ability of \nthe Secretary of Defense to carry out the defense strategic guidance issued earlier this year, and \nhindering the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions consistent with the new strategy.  \nThe Administration also strongly objects to the inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are \nbeyond the scope of funding legislation. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5856, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the \nbill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nAdministration Priorities.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for certain \npriorities, including:  funding for Overseas Contingency Operations; the requested pay raise for \nmilitary personnel; DOD's program of basic research; the Defense Advanced Research Projects  Agency; and air and missile defense programs, including support for the Government of Israel to \npurchase additional Iron Dome missile systems.   \n \nLimitations on Retirement of Aircraft.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 8116 through \n8118 of the bill that would restrict the Air Force and Army from divesting, transferring or retiring \nunneeded aircraft, including C-27Js, C-23s, and RQ-4 Global Hawk Block 30 Unmanned Aerial \nVehicles (UAVs).  These provisions would force DOD to operate, sustain, and maintain aircraft that \nare in excess to national security requirements, as defined by the new defense strategy, and are not \naffordable in an austere budget environment.  They also would impair the ability of the Secretary to \nmanage the Department and, by retaining large numbers of under-resourced aircraft in the fleet in \ntoday's fiscally constrained environment, could contribute to a hollow force.  \n \nUnnecessary Funding.  The Administration is concerned about the billions of dollars the bill provides \nfor items DOD did not request and does not need, as well as section 8006 of the bill, which makes \nspending on these unnecessary items statutorily required.  This diverts resources from more important \ndefense programs and limits the Secretary's flexibility to manage the Department efficiently.  \n \nIncremental Funding.  The Administration strongly opposes the use of incremental funding, which \nundermines program stability and cost discipline.  The bill would provide incremental funding for \nSpace-Based Infrared System satellites rather than full funding through advance appropriations, as the \nAdministration requested in the FY 2013 Budget request.  In addition, the bill provides less than half \nof the $911 million requested to deactivate the USS Enterprise.  \n \nArmy Depot Maintenance.  The Administration strongly objects to the reduction in the Army's depot \nmaintenance program as specified in section 8087 of the bill.  The reduction of nearly $2.5 billion from \nthe FY 2013 Budget request would create long-term delays in modernization and readiness for \nhelicopters, radars, and the Stryker combat vehicle.  Additionally, with this funding reduction the \nArmy would not meet core depot logistics requirements for many of its systems.  This cut would \ndirectly reduce Army readiness.  \n \nMedium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS).  The Administration strongly objects to the \nCommittee's decision to omit funding for MEADS.  If the Congress does not appropriate the funding in \nthe FY 2013 Budget request, there is a high likelihood that this action would be perceived by our \npartners, Italy and Germany, as breaking our commitment under the Memorandum of Understanding.  \nThis could harm our relationship with our Allies on a much broader basis, including future \nmultinational cooperative projects.  It also could prevent the completion of the agreed Proof of \nConcept activities, which would provide data archiving, analysis of testing, and software development \nnecessary to harvest technology from U.S. and partner investments in MEADS.  \n \nTRICARE Fees and Co-Payments.  The Administration is disappointed that the Congress did not \nincorporate the requested TRICARE fee initiatives into either the appropriation or authorization \nlegislation.  The Administration asks the House to reconsider the TRICARE fee proposals, which are \nessential for DOD to successfully address rising personnel costs.  The $1.8 billion in savings are part \nof a carefully balanced FY 2013 Budget request.  \n \nAdvanced Drop-In Biofuel Production.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $70 million \nfrom the FY 2013 Budget request intended to support the development of a domestic capability to \n2  produce cost-competitive advanced drop-in biofuels at a commercial scale, which is important to the \ncountry's long-term national security.  Developing large-scale capacity to produce biofuels, in \ncollaboration with the Departments of Agriculture and Energy, would help insulate the Nation as a \nwhole, as well as the military, from price shocks arising from supply disruptions and price volatility of \npetroleum products.  \n \nMQ-8 Fire Scout UAV.  The Administration opposes the $66 million reduction from the FY 2013 \nBudget request for the Fire Scout upgrade, which would enable the Special Forces to track potential \ntargets at greater distances and for longer periods.  The proposed reduction would prevent the Navy \nfrom fielding a system that meets the needs of the Special Forces in FY 2014.   \n \nAfloat Forward Staging Base (AFSB).  The Administration opposes elimination of funding for AFSB.  \nThe $38 million requested in the FY 2013 Budget request is needed for advanced procurement of \nAFSB, which would meet Combatant Commanders' requirements for special operations and mine \nclearance.  Further, AFSB is critical to the health of the shipbuilding industrial base as it is the only \nauxiliary ship in the Navy's shipbuilding plan until FY 2016.  \n \nCountering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems.  The Administration objects to the 56-\npercent reduction from the FY 2013 Budget request for the CWMD Systems program, which integrates \nintelligence information about weapons of mass destruction for senior government officials.  The \nMilitary Departments and Combatant Commands have repeatedly identified data fusion as a critical \ncapability gap.  The full $54 million requested in the FY 2013 Budget request is needed to start fusion \ncenter operations by the end of FY 2013.  The proposed reduction would cause the Department to \nassume significant tactical, operational, and strategic risk. \n \nDefense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund (DAWDF).  The Administration opposes the \nreduction of $224 million from the FY 2013 Budget request for DAWDF.  Failure to provide the full \nrequest of $274 million would require DOD to collect from other budget accounts the shortfall \nbetween the appropriation and the statutory minimum for DAWDF.  The reduction in the appropriation \nwould put unnecessary stress on the Operation and Maintenance budget at a time when funding levels \nare already constrained.  \n \nGeneral Transfer Authority.  The Administration opposes the reduction of general transfer authority \nprovided in section 8005 of the bill.  The $3 billion limit provided by the Committee significantly \nrestricts DOD's ability to accommodate changing circumstances and to respond to urgent requirements \nin support of deployed forces, such as for force protection, in a timely manner.  DOD needs sufficient \ntransfer authority in order to match individual accounts to programmatic needs.  \n \nIntelligence Community Management Account.  The Administration opposes the exclusion of section \n8045 proposed in the FY 2013 Budget request, which provides critical language to authorize the \nProgram Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE) to transfer funds to other \nFederal departments and agencies.  Without transfer authority, PM-ISE would lose its ability to \nleverage agency efforts and work effectively with non-Federal partners to improve the performance of \nthe information sharing environment in support of national security.   \n \nClassified Programs.  The Administration understands that there could be problematic funding \nadjustments contained in the Classified Annex to the bill and looks forward to providing its views on \n3  this annex once it becomes available.  \n \nCivilian Pay Freeze.  The Administration objects to section 8119 of the bill, which does not fund the \n0.5 percent civilian pay raise for calendar year 2013 proposed in the FY 2013 Budget request.  As the \nPresident stated in his FY 2013 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.  \n \nRiders \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders that have no place in \nfunding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill: \n \nLimitation on Reimbursement of the Government of Pakistan.  Section 9015 would require the \nSecretary of Defense to certify Pakistan's cooperation on issues outside of his purview and would \nseverely constrict DOD's ability to respond to emergent war-time coalition support requirements, \nnegatively affecting our campaign in Afghanistan. \n \nVeterans Memorial Object Transfer.  Section 8120 would prohibit the transfer of a veterans memorial \nobject to a foreign country or an entity controlled by a foreign government without specific \nauthorization in law.  This provision would restrict the President's ability to take actions to demonstrate \ngoodwill toward foreign allies and partners by lending or giving historical artifacts in instances where \ndoing so would serve the national security interests of the United States.  \n \nDetainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to and has constitutional concerns about the \nprovisions of sections 8108 and 8109 that limit the use of funds to transfer detainees and otherwise \nrestrict detainee transfers.  Section 8108 undermines national security and this unnecessarily constrains \nthe Nation's counterterrorism efforts, particularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 \noption for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have \nleveraged the flexibility and strength of this country's Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous \nterrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The continued prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an \nessential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available option.  \nAdditionally, the restrictions in section 8109 on the transfer of detainees to the United States and to the \ncustody or effective control of foreign countries or entities in the context of an ongoing armed conflict \nmay interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees \nand to make important foreign policy and national security determinations regarding whether and \nunder what circumstances such transfers should occur.  The restrictions or interferences in both these \nsections would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.    \n \nIn addition, the Administration strongly opposes section 8110 which would prohibit the use of funds to \nconstruct, acquire or modify a detention facility in the United States.  This would constrain the \nflexibility that the Nation's Armed Forces and counterterrorism professionals need to deal with \nevolving threats, intruding upon the Executive Branch's ability to carry out its mission. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations process \nmoves forward.  \n* * * * * * * \n \n4  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nNovember 15, 2011 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH. J. Res. 2 \u2013 Proposing a Balanced Budget Amendment \n(Rep. Goodlatte, R-VA, and 242 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H. J. Res. 2.   We do not need to amend the Constitution \nfor only the 28th time in our nation\u2019s history to do the job of restoring fiscal discipline.  Instead, it \nrequires us \u2013 as members of both parties have done in the past \u2013 to move beyond politics as usual \nand find bipartisan common ground to restore us to a sustainable fiscal path. \n \nH. J. Res. 2 would impose serious risks for our economy in several ways. It risks accelerating \neconomic downturns by requiring the government to raise taxes and cut spending in the face of a \ncontraction, which would accelerate job losses. The President proposed a balanced approach to \nrestore fiscal sustainability and in a way that doesn\u2019t slow the Federal Government's ability to \ninitiate actions that help stabilize the economy and keep future recessions from becoming \nworse.  By contrast, under H. J. Res. 2, a minority in a single house of Congress could block the \nwill of the majority and the Executive to waive its provisions when our country faces a \ndownturn. If H. J. Res. 2 had been in effect in recent years, such a minority in one house would \nhave been able to prevent efforts to override the requirement for tax increases or spending cuts, \nrisking an even deeper contraction and pushing the economy into a second Great \nDepression.   Further, H. J. Res. 2 ducks responsibility and does not take the Nation's fiscal \nchallenges head-on.  Rather, it could inevitably result in handing the hard decisions that our \nelected representatives in the Congress should be making to the Federal Courts.   \n \nIn addition, absent a willingness to raise substantially higher revenues than in the House Budget \nResolution by closing tax loopholes or asking the most fortunate to pay more, H. J. Res. 2 would \nundercut the Federal Government's ability to meet its core commitments to seniors, middle class \nfamilies and the most vulnerable, while reducing our ability to invest in our future. This could \nresult in severe cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security that are growing due to the \nretirement of the baby boomers, putting at risk the retirement security of millions of Americans, \nand it could result in significant cuts to education, research and development, and other programs \ncritical to growing our economy and winning the future.   \n \nH. J. Res. 2 is not a solution to the Nation's deficits.  The Administration is committed to \nworking with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to achieve real deficit reduction.  The President \nlaid out a set of recommendations to the Joint Select Committee to achieve over $4 trillion in \nbalanced deficit reduction, including the deficit reduction already locked in by the Budget \nControl Act.  The President urges the Committee to meet or exceed its mandate for deficit \nreduction. \n \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nApril 16, 2012 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 2230 \u2013 Paying a Fair Share Act \n(Sen. Whitehouse, D-RI, and 13 cosponsors) \n  \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2230, which would set a minimum \ntax rate for taxpayers with annual income greater than $1 million.  S. 2230 will ensure that the \nNation's wealthiest people are not able to use tax preferences and shelters to reduce their tax rate \nbelow what middle class families pay.  \n \nOver the past fifty years, the average tax rate paid by the very highest-income Americans has \nfallen to a near low \u2013 even as their share of the Nation's income has risen to one of the highest \nlevels in close to a century.  As a result, one in four taxpayers with annual income greater than \n$1 million today pays a lower tax rate than millions of hardworking middle-class households.    \nS. 2230 would address that most basic source of unfairness by limiting the degree to which the \nmost financially fortunate can take advantage of tax expenditures and preferential rates on \ncertain income. \n \nThe Administration believes that S. 2230 would not only make the Nation's tax system more fair, \nbut will also help the economy by closing inefficient tax shelters and loopholes and by allowing \nthe Nation to continue making the vital investments that strengthen the economy and provide \neconomic security for middle class families.  All Americans are being asked to come together to \nmake the sort of shared sacrifices that will allow the Nation to continue making crucial \ninvestments in areas that will help the economy grow and create jobs, such as education, \nresearch, and infrastructure.

Gardner, R- CO, and 26 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to a common sense approach to cut oil imports by a third by \n2025, in order to secure America\u2019s energy future and protect consumers.  The Administration \nintends to do this by both producing more oil at home and reducing our dependence on oil by \nusing cleaner, alternative fuels and improving our energy efficiency.  In support of more safe and \nresponsible domestic oil and gas production, the Administration is already taking steps \nincluding: expediting the search for resources; leasing new areas both offshore and onshore; \nproviding incentives for the development of existing leases; and issuing permits to drill, \nconsistent with rigorous safety standards and environmental responsibility.  However, the \nAdministration opposes H.R. 2021, because it would curtail the authority of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to help ensure \nthat domestic oil production on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) proceeds safely, \nresponsibly, and with opportunities for efficient stakeholder input.  \n \nH.R. 2021 would limit existing EPA authority to protect human health and the \nenvironment.  The bill would:  (1) preclude EPA from requiring offshore sources to demonstrate \ncompliance with health-based air quality standards anywhere but in a single onshore area; \n(2) reduce the length of time during which exploration platforms and drill ships are emission \nsources under the CAA, thereby limiting the time when emissions would be controlled; and \n(3) make it impossible to use the permitting program to set emission control requirements for \nservice vessels associated with offshore sources.

Cantor, R-VA) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 6684, the \"Spending Reduction Act of 2012.\"  The \nbill's unbalanced provisions fail the test of fairness and shared responsibility.  At the same time \nthat the House is advancing a bill to extend tax cuts for wealthy individuals while raising taxes \non 25 million students and working families, H.R. 6684 would impose deep budget cuts that cost \njobs and hurt middle class and vulnerable Americans \u2013 especially seniors, veterans, and children.  \nThe President has made clear that the Congress can and must act to avoid the sweeping impacts \nof sequestration by passing a balanced deficit reduction package. \n \nThe bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) included a sequestration mechanism with \nmutually disagreeable cuts to both defense and non-defense funding.  This sequestration, \nscheduled to occur on January 2, 2013, would have destructive effects on national security; on \nimportant domestic investments such as education, research and development, and rebuilding the \nNation's crumbling infrastructure; and on core government programs from air traffic control to \nlaw enforcement.  The threat of these destructive cuts under the BCA was intended to force \naction by the Congress on deficit reduction. \n \nIn contrast, the approach put forward in this bill, virtually identical to earlier legislation, \neliminates the defense portion of the pending sequester and does so in a way that imposes far \ngreater cuts in the non-defense part of the budget than the existing sequester would entail.     \nH.R. 6684 would do nothing to address the reductions in discretionary spending and the \nsequestration in mandatory programs after 2013.  \n \nRather than pursuing a comprehensive, balanced deficit reduction package to replace \nsequestration, H.R. 6684 undermines the intent of the BCA to bring both sides to compromise by \nproposing a short-term, one-sided solution.  This approach sharply undermines critical domestic \npriorities, such as efforts to prevent hunger and support low-income families and communities; \nto make health care more affordable through the implementation of the health care law; to \nprotect consumers and implement the Wall Street Reform Act; and to support homeowners \nstruggling to stay in their homes.  The Administration strongly opposes both the principles of this \napproach and specific legislative proposals included in the bill.  \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 6684, he would veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n   \n  November 3, 2011 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 1786 \u2013 Long-Term Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2011  \n(Sen. Hatch, R-Utah) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes passage of S. 1786 because the bill does not give the \nNation\u2019s economy the jumpstart it needs right now, even as it would undermine key \nenvironmental and public health protections and seriously disrupt the Federal Government's \nservices.  The President has proposed immediately investing $50 billion in the Nation's \nhighways, transit, rail, and aviation, which would put hundreds of thousands of construction \nworkers back on the job and modernize America's crumbling infrastructure for the long-\nterm.  The President has also proposed a national infrastructure bank capitalized with $10 billion, \nin order to leverage private and public capital in innovative and reform-minded ways without \nearmarks or political influence.  None of these proposals are contained in S. 1786. \n \nAmong the problematic provisions that the Administration strongly opposes that are included in \nthis bill are:   \n \nTitle IV of the bill would impose an unprecedented requirement that a joint resolution of \napproval be enacted by the Congress before any major rule of Executive Branch agencies could \nhave force or effect.  This radical departure from the longstanding separation of powers between \nthe Executive and Legislative branches would delay and, in many cases, thwart implementation \nof statutory mandates and execution of duly enacted laws, increase business uncertainty, \nundermine much-needed protections of the American public, and create unnecessary confusion. \nThere is no justification for such an unprecedented requirement.   \n \nTitle V and Section 140 would undermine public health protections under the Clean Air Act \n(CAA) and would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from moving ahead with \nlong-overdue requirements to reduce air pollution from industrial boilers, solid waste \nincinerators, and cement plants.  They also weaken EPA's ability to ensure that its standards \nprotect American families from a range of harmful pollutants including mercury and other toxic \nmetals, as well as smog and soot.  Delaying implementation of important air pollution standards \nwould increase exposure to mercury, which can impair children's ability to think and \nlearn.  Delay due to this title and section could mean foregoing over a hundred billion dollars in \nhealth benefits.  Each additional year of delay would mean foregoing tens of billions of dollars \nmore in net benefits. \n \nTitle VI, the Regulatory Time-Out Act of 2011, would block implementation of critical public \nhealth and safety protections.  This Administration is committed to a regulatory system that is \ninformed by science, cost-justified, and consistent with economic growth. \n \nFinally, S. 1786 seeks to pay for its proposals with a rescission of $40 billion of appropriated \nfunds that runs counter to the spirit of two recent bipartisan agreements, including the recently- enacted Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  Disregarding the BCA agreement and cutting \nalready-tight discretionary program levels even further, as this bill would do, would be a serious \nmistake.  The bill's unspecified rescission of $40 billion in appropriated funds would cause \nserious disruption in the Federal Government\u2019s basic services in support of critical national \ngoals, such as supporting education, protecting public safety, and promoting economic growth. \n \nIf the President is presented with S. 1786, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the \nbill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \nJuly 11, 2011 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2417 \u2013 Better Use of Light Bulbs Act \n(Rep.

These workers need, and would benefit from, job retraining and \nother services.  As the United States expands access to other markets through new Free Trade \nAgreements, the Federal Government can help ensure that American workers are provided with \nthe tools they need to take advantage of opportunities for retraining and other services and to \ncompete in the global economy. \n \nThe TAA provisions preserve the key goals of the 2009 TAA program reforms (which expired in \nFebruary, 2011), such as covering service workers and workers whose jobs shift to China, India, \nand other countries, to help ensure workers adversely affected by global competition are given \nthe best opportunity to acquire skills and credentials to get good jobs.  The Administration \nestimates that this version of TAA will provide significant savings when compared to a straight \nextension of the full 2009 program. \nThe Administration is pleased that this legislation also renews and extends the GSP, one of the \nUnited States' largest preference programs. The GSP program provides preferential, duty-free \nentry to the United States for up to 4,800 products from 129 designated beneficiary countries and \nterritories.  Many GSP imports are used as inputs by U.S. companies to manufacture goods here \nin the United States.  The program is particularly important to American small businesses, many \nof which rely on the program's duty savings to stay competitive.  The lapse in GSP authorization \nhas already cost U.S. businesses tens of millions of dollars in additional import duties, increased \ncosts to American manufacturers and consumers, and undercut efforts by poor countries to grow \ntheir economies and fight poverty.

Rogers, R-MI, and 112 cosponsors) \nThe Administration is committed to increasing public-private sharing of information about \ncybersecurity threats as an essential part of comprehensive legislation to protect the Nation's vital \ninformation systems and critical infrastructure.  The sharing of information must be conducted in \na manner that preserves Americans' privacy, data confidentiality, and civil liberties and \nrecognizes the civilian nature of cyberspace.  Cybersecurity and privacy are not mutually \nexclusive.  Moreover, information sharing, while an essential component of comprehensive \nlegislation, is not alone enough to protect the Nation's core critical infrastructure from cyber \nthreats.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3523, the Cyber Intelligence \nSharing and Protection Act, in its current form. \n \nH.R. 3523 fails to provide authorities to ensure that the Nation's core critical infrastructure is \nprotected while repealing important provisions of electronic surveillance law without instituting \ncorresponding privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties safeguards.  For example, the bill \nwould allow broad sharing of information with governmental entities without establishing \nrequirements for both industry and the Government to minimize and protect personally \nidentifiable information.  Moreover, such sharing should be accomplished in a way that permits \nappropriate sharing within the Government without undue restrictions imposed by private sector \ncompanies that share information. \n \nThe bill also lacks sufficient limitations on the sharing of personally identifiable information \nbetween private entities and does not contain adequate oversight or accountability measures \nnecessary to ensure that the data is used only for appropriate purposes.  Citizens have a right to \nknow that corporations will be held legally accountable for failing to safeguard personal \ninformation adequately.  The Government, rather than establishing a new antitrust exemption \nunder this bill, should ensure that information is not shared for anti-competitive purposes.   \n \nIn addition, H.R. 3523 would inappropriately shield companies from any suits where a \ncompany's actions are based on cyber threat information identified, obtained, or shared under this \nbill, regardless of whether that action otherwise violated Federal criminal law or results in \ndamage or loss of life.  This broad liability protection not only removes a strong incentive to \nimproving cybersecurity, it also potentially undermines our Nation's economic, national security, \nand public safety interests. \n \nH.R. 3523 effectively treats domestic cybersecurity as an intelligence activity and thus, \nsignificantly departs from longstanding efforts to treat the Internet and cyberspace as civilian \nspheres.  The Administration believes that a civilian agency \u2013 the Department of Homeland \nSecurity \u2013 must have a central role in domestic cybersecurity, including for conducting and  overseeing the exchange of cybersecurity information with the private sector and with sector-\nspecific Federal agencies. \nThe American people expect their Government to enhance security without undermining their \nprivacy and civil liberties.  Without clear legal protections and independent oversight, \ninformation sharing legislation will undermine the public's trust in the Government as well as in \nthe Internet by undermining fundamental privacy, confidentiality, civil liberties, and consumer \nprotections.  The Administration's draft legislation, submitted last May, provided for information \nsharing with clear privacy protections and strong oversight by the independent Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board.   \n \nThe Administration's proposal also provided authority for the Federal Government to ensure that \nthe Nation's critical infrastructure operators are taking the steps necessary to protect the \nAmerican people.  The Congress must also include authorities to ensure our Nation's most vital \ncritical infrastructure assets are properly protected by meeting minimum cybersecurity \nperformance standards.  Industry would develop these standards collaboratively with the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.  Voluntary measures alone are insufficient responses to the \ngrowing danger of cyber threats.   \n \nLegislation should address core critical infrastructure vulnerabilities without sacrificing the \nfundamental values of privacy and civil liberties for our citizens, especially at a time our Nation \nis facing challenges to our economic well-being and national security.  The Administration looks \nforward to continuing to engage with the Congress in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to enact \ncybersecurity legislation to address these critical issues.

Lamar Smith, R-Texas, and 26 cosponsors) \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they are tailored \nto advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that they minimize \nuncertainty.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 527, the \nRegulatory Flexibility Improvements Act.  The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act would impose \nunneeded and costly analytical and procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from \nperforming their statutory responsibilities.  It would also create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty \nand increase costs for businesses and further impede the implementation of commonsense protections for \nthe American public. \n \nThe Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act would impose unnecessary new procedures on agencies and \ninvite frivolous litigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to \nthe robust and well understood procedural requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended by \nthe Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act \nand other federal statutes such as the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and the Paperwork Reduction \nAct.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and \nfollowed by administrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate \nregulations only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory \nalternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  With respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act in \nparticular, agencies already have in place procedures and policies, as required by Executive Order 13272, \nto ensure that agencies take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.  \nFurthermore, this Administration\u2019s deep commitment to promoting small business and ensuring that \nregulations do not unduly burden the Nation\u2019s small businesses is reflected in Executive Order 13563, \nwhich requires agencies to examine existing regulations and to eliminate, streamline, or alter them where \nthey are excessively burdensome, and the January 18 President Memorandum on Regulatory Flexibility, \nSmall Business, and Job Creation.  Furthermore, this Administration's deep commitment to promoting \nsmall business and ensuring that regulations do not unduly burden the Nation's small businesses is \nreflected in Executive Order 13563, which requires agencies to examine existing regulations and to \neliminate, streamline, or alter them where they are excessively burdensome. \n \nPassage of H.R. 527 would replace the existing framework with layers of additional procedural \nrequirements that would seriously undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory \nmandates.  It would unjustifiably expand the use of advocacy review panels, require excessive and \nunnecessary retrospective review of rules, and create needless grounds of judicial review and judicial \nremedies.  It would also impose unrealistic analytic requirements on agencies far beyond the already \nrigorous existing requirements that promote commonsense regulation.  In these ways and others, the \nRegulatory Flexibility Improvements Act would impede the ability of agencies to provide the public with  basic protections, and create needless confusion and delay that would prove disruptive for businesses, as \nwell as for state, tribal and local governments.    \n \nIf the President were presented with the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, his senior advisors \nwould recommend that he veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n November 17, 2011 \n (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.

Rather than candidates having to rely on raising large sums of private money in \norder to run, the system provides qualifying presidential candidates with the option of accepting \nmatching funds in the primary and a public grant in the general election.  It has done so at \nminimal cost to taxpayers, who fund it by voluntarily choosing to direct $3 of their Federal taxes \nto this beneficial system.  For many years, the system worked well and attracted wide \nparticipation.  In time, however, it became clear that a system introduced in the 1970s was in \nneed of modernization and repair.  Beginning in the 2000 Presidential campaign, candidates \nbegan to opt out.  Since that time, promising proposals for the strengthening of the system have \nbeen made.   \n \nH.R. 359 would kill the system, not strengthen it.  Its effect would be to expand the power of \ncorporations and special interests in the Nation\u2019s elections; to force many candidates into an \nendless cycle of fundraising at the expense of engagement with voters on the issues; and to place \na premium on access to large donor or special interest support, narrowing the field of otherwise \nworthy candidates.  After a year in which the Citizens United decision rolled back a century of \nlaw to allow corporate interests to spend vast sums in the Nation\u2019s elections and to do so without \ndisclosing the true interests behind them, this is not the time to further empower the special \ninterests or to obstruct the work of reform.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n \n  May 2, 2011 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1214 \u2013 Repealing Mandatory Funding for School-Based Health Center Construction \n(Rep.

These important changes include: ending the worst \npractices of insurance companies; giving uninsured individuals and small business owners the \nsame kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress have; and bringing \ndown the cost of health care for families and businesses while also reducing Federal budget \ndeficits.  \n \nAs the President indicated in the State of the Union, the Administration is eager to work with the \nCongress to improve the Affordable Care Act by making care better or more affordable.  Rather \nthan making refinements to improve the law, H.R. 1214 simply proposes to eliminate funding.  It \ndoes not advance the key objectives of the Affordable Care Act or offer alternative solutions for \nmeeting these important objectives, and the bill may make it harder to achieve better and more \naffordable care.  H.R. 1214 would repeal the Affordable Care Act's school-based health center \nconstruction grants and rescind unobligated balances.  These funds support the improvement and \nexpansion of health centers in schools across the Nation to improve access to primary care health \ncare services for children. \n \nThe Administration will continue to work with the Congress to responsibly implement the \nAffordable Care Act.

As more and more \nAmerican families rely on women's wages for a significant portion of their income, the pay gap hurts \nnot only women, but the families that depend on them. \n \nThe Paycheck Fairness Act is commonsense legislation that strengthens the Equal Pay Act and would \ngive women the tools they need to fight pay discrimination.

Specifically, it would prohibit retaliation against \nemployees who ask about or discuss wage information, and would provide more effective remedies \nfor women subjected to discriminatory pay practices.  S. 3220 would strengthen the Equal Pay Act by \nclosing judicially-created loopholes for employer defenses and by bringing its class action rules into \nconformity with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Adams, R-FL, and 40 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4970, a bill that would undermine the core principles of \nthe Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).  VAWA is a landmark piece of legislation that first \npassed the Congress in 1994 and has twice been reauthorized with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport, each time with important improvements to strengthen VAWA.  The Act transformed the \nNation's response to violence against women and brought critically needed resources to States and \nlocal communities to address these crimes. \n \nH.R. 4970 retreats from this forward progress by failing to include several critical provisions that \nare part of the Senate-passed VAWA reauthorization bill.  For instance, H.R. 4970 fails to provide \nfor concurrent special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction by tribal authorities over non-Indians, \nand omits clarification of tribal courts' full civil jurisdiction regarding certain protection orders over \nnon-Indians.  Given that three out of five Native American women experience domestic violence in \ntheir lifetime, these omissions in H.R. 4970 are unacceptable.  The bill also fails to include language \nthat would prohibit discrimination against LGBT victims in VAWA grant programs.  No sexual \nassault or domestic violence victim should be beaten, hurt, or killed because they could not access \nneeded support, assistance, and protection.  In addition, H.R. 4970 does not include important \nimprovements to the Clery Act found in the Senate-passed bill that would address the high rates of \ndating violence and sexual assault experienced by young people in college and other higher \neducation institutions.  The bill also weakens critical new provisions in the Senate-passed bill that \nwould improve safety for victims living in subsidized housing.  \n \nH.R. 4970 also takes direct aim at immigrant victims of domestic violence and sexual assault by \nremoving critical protections currently in law.  H.R. 4970 allows abusers to be notified when a \nvictim files a VAWA self-petition for relief, and it eliminates the path to citizenship for U visa \nholders \u2013 victims of serious crimes such as torture, rape, and domestic violence \u2013 who are \ncooperating with law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of these crimes.  These \nproposals senselessly remove existing legal protections, undermine VAWA's core purpose of \nprotecting victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, frustrate important law enforcement \nobjectives, and jeopardize victims by placing them directly in harm's way.  \n \nThe Administration urges the House to find common ground with the bipartisan Senate-passed bill \nand consider and pass legislation that will protect all victims.  H.R. 4970 rolls back existing law and \nremoves long-standing protections for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault \u2013 crimes that \npredominately affect women.  If the President is presented with H.R. 4970, his senior advisors \nwould recommend that he veto the bill. \n   \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n  June 18, 2012 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS.J. Res. 37 \u2013 Disapproving EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards \n(Sen. Inhofe, R-OK) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes S.J. Res. 37, which would overturn long-overdue national clean \nair standards limiting power plant emissions of toxic air pollution, including mercury.  As a result, this \nresolution would cause substantial harm to public health and undermine our Nation's longstanding \ncommitment to clean up pollution from power plants. \n \nSince it was enacted in 1970 and amended in 1977 and 1990, each time with strong bipartisan support, \nthe Clean Air Act (CAA) has improved the Nation's air quality and protected public health.  Since \n1970, the economy has grown over 200 percent while emissions of key pollutants have decreased more \nthan 60 percent.  More than forty years of clean air regulation has shown that a strong economy and \nstrong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand. \n \nS.J. Res. 37 would undermine more than forty years of CAA progress by blocking the Mercury and Air \nToxics Standards, the first national standards to protect American families from harmful power plant \nemissions of mercury and other toxic air pollution like arsenic, acid gases, nickel, and chromium.  By \naddressing the largest remaining source of mercury emissions in the United States, these standards will \nreduce our children's exposure to this neurotoxicant which can impair their ability to think and \nlearn.  Because technology to control toxics also reduces fine particle pollution, the standards will help \nAmerica's children grow up healthier, preventing 130,000 cases of childhood asthma symptoms and \nover 6,000 cases of acute bronchitis among children each year.  EPA further estimates that emissions \nreductions resulting from meeting these standards will prevent as many as 11,000 avoidable premature \ndeaths and 4,700 heart attacks, annually.  The annual value of these health benefits alone is estimated \nto be as much as $90 billion.  In addition, the standards will reduce the risk of numerous other non-\nmonetized yet devastating health effects, including illnesses of the central nervous system, damage to \nkidneys, and cancer. \n \nThe Mercury and Air Toxics Standards will ensure that the Nation's power plants install modern, \nwidely available technologies to limit harmful pollution \u2013 leveling the playing field for power plants \nthat already have such controls in place.  The standards are achievable; pollution control equipment \nthat can help meet them already is installed at more than half of the Nation's coal-fired power \nplants.  Numerous studies, including analysis by the Department of Energy, have projected that the \nstandards can be met without adversely affecting the adequacy of electric generation resources in any \nregion of the country. \n \nFinally, if a rule is disapproved under the Congressional Review Act, an agency may not issue a rule \nthat is \u201csubstantially the same.\u201d  In this case, because EPA has adhered closely to its narrowly  circumscribed authority under the CAA in promulgating these standards, the enactment of S.J. Res. 37 \ncould effectively prevent EPA from ever limiting mercury and air toxics pollution from power plants. \n \nIf the President were presented with S.J.

Under the Agreement, over \n80 percent of U.S. industrial and consumer goods exports (not including petroleum) will gain \nduty-free access to the Colombian market immediately upon implementation.  This will help to \nlevel the playing field, since 91 percent of our imports from Colombia have enjoyed duty- free \naccess to our market.  U.S. agricultural exports in particular will enjoy substantial new \nimprovements in access to Colombia's market.  Currently, no U.S. agricultural exports enjoy \nduty free access to Colombia.  Once the Agreement enters into force, almost 70 percent, by \nvalue, of current U.S. agricultural exports will be able to enter Colombia duty-free immediately. \n \nThe Agreement contains state of the art provisions to help protect and enforce intellectual \nproperty rights, reduce regulatory red tape, and eliminate regulatory barriers to U.S. \nexports.  The Agreement also contains high standards for protecting labor rights, carrying out \ncovered environmental agreements, and ensuring that key domestic labor and environmental \nlaws are enforced, combined with strong remedies for non-compliance.  Colombia has already \nmade significant reforms related to the obligations it will have under the labor chapter, including \nmeasures taken under the Colombian Action Plan Related to Labor Rights.  The Administration \nwill ensure that Colombia has successfully implemented key elements of the Action Plan before \nthe Administration will bring the Agreement into force. \n \nThe Agreement forms an integral part of the Administration's larger strategy of doubling exports \nby the end of 2014.  In addition, the Agreement represents an historic development in our \nrelations with Colombia, a steadfast strategic partner for the United States and a leader in the \nregion.  The Agreement reflects the commitment of the United States to supporting democracy \nand economic growth in Colombia.  The Agreement will also help Colombia battle production of \nillegal crops by creating alternative economic opportunities. \n \nThe bill also extends the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), which helps countries in their \nfight against drug production and trafficking by expanding their economic alternatives.  \nExtension of this program will restore, until the entry into force of the Agreement, the access that \nColombian goods had enjoyed under ATPA prior to its expiration in February 2011. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  September 21, 2011 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2401 \u2013 Transparency in Regulatory Analysis of Impacts on the Nation Act of 2011 \n  (Rep.

Biggert, R-IL) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports serious, bipartisan efforts to prevent interest rates from \ndoubling for over 7 million college students in the coming year.  Absent Congressional action, \non July 1, the interest rate on new subsidized Federal Direct Stafford Loans for undergraduate \nstudents is set to double, from 3.4% to 6.8%.  Taking action to stop the doubling of these rates \nwill save students $1,000, on average, over the life of their loans.  Students are increasingly \nrelying on loans to finance postsecondary education, often absorbing tuition hikes stemming \nfrom reductions in State funding and institutional support.  Graduates should not be burdened \nwith unmanageable college debt as they seek to launch a career or a business, start a family, or \nbuy a house.   \n \nUnfortunately, rather than finding common ground on a way to pay for this critical policy, H.R. \n4628 includes an attempt to repeal the Prevention and Public Health Fund, created to help \nprevent disease, detect it early, and manage conditions before they become severe.

Lieberman, I-CT, and 4 cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3414, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012.  \nWhile lacking some of the key provisions of earlier bills, the revised legislation will provide \nimportant tools to strengthen the Nation's response to cybersecurity risks.  The legislation also \nreflects many of the priorities included in the Administration's legislative proposal. \nThe Administration particularly appreciates the bill's strong protections for privacy and civil \nliberties and would not support amendments that weaken these protections.  The Administration \nagrees that it is essential that the collection, use, and disclosure of such information remain \nclosely tied to the purposes of detecting and mitigating cybersecurity threats, while still allowing \nlaw enforcement to investigate and prosecute serious crimes.  All entities \u2013 public and private \u2013\nmust be accountable for how they handle such data.  The bill should take care not to duplicate \nexisting domestic or international law enforcement frameworks.  The bill also must protect the \nconfidentiality of statistical data and honor the statutory confidentiality pledges made to \nrespondents.  The Administration is confident that S. 3414 can improve the Nation's \ncybersecurity while protecting the privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties that are central to \nAmerican values.   \nThe revised bill contains critical-infrastructure protection measures that are less robust than in \nearlier drafts, but would still produce meaningful cybersecurity improvements.  However, the \nAdministration would not support amendments that would weaken the critical infrastructure \nprotection measures in the legislation, including: (1) reducing the Federal Government's existing \nroles and responsibilities in coordinating and endorsing the outcome-based cybersecurity \npractices; (2) weakening the statutory authorities of the Department of Homeland Security to \naccomplish its critical infrastructure protection mission; or (3) substantially expanding the \nnarrowly-tailored liability protections for private sector entities.  While liability limitations are \nnecessary to encourage information sharing, overly broad immunities from legal obligations \nwould undermine the very trust that the bill seeks to strengthen. \nS. 3414 would create an interagency National Cybersecurity Council to coordinate the \nidentification of voluntary cybersecurity practices for critical cyber infrastructure.  As currently \ndrafted, the structure of the National Cybersecurity Council raises constitutional concerns and \nshould be amended to employ an administrative structure similar to that of other recently \nestablished councils.  Further, the bill contains provisions purporting to prescribe the Executive \nbranch's responsibilities in coordinating with foreign governments and conducting diplomatic \nnegotiations.  These provisions should be clarified so as to maintain the President's exclusive  constitutional authority to conduct diplomacy.  The Administration also believes that to ensure \nconsistency with existing law, processes, and Presidential directives, certain provisions must be \naddressed in the final bill regarding the protection of intelligence sources and methods, as well as \ninformation sharing and policy coordination. \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that cybersecurity \nlegislation is sufficiently comprehensive to address the growing cyber threats facing the Nation. \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n  June 23, 2011 \n  (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2219 \u2014 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2012 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)  \n \nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration\u2019s views on the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act, 2012, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee.  The \nAdministration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means and reducing the deficit \nso that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  That is why the President \nput forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, supports \neconomic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, meets the commitments \nmade to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their circumstances, and provides for \nour national security.   \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes a number of provisions in this bill.  If a bill is presented to the \nPresident that undermines his ability as Commander in Chief or includes ideological or political \npolicy riders, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend a veto. \n \nWhile overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of \nongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership \non the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, the Administration has concerns regarding the level of \nresources the bill would provide for programs necessary to meet national security, including: \n \nConventional Prompt Global Strike (CPGS).  Current systems do not provide the President with a \ntimely, global, non-nuclear strike capability to address fleeting, time-sensitive targets.  The \nimportance of this requirement is documented in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review and was an \nelement in support of ratification of the New START Treaty.  This bill would limit the Department \nof Defense's (DOD's) ability to assemble critical CPGS technology data, delay transition from \ntechnology development to an acquisition program, and ultimately delay deployment of a CPGS \nsystem by two years.  \n \nAdvance Appropriations for Acquisitions.  The bill would provide only incremental funding \u2013 \nundermining stability and cost discipline \u2013 rather than the advance appropriations that the \nAdministration requested for the procurement of Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites \nand certain classified programs.   \nJoint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF).  The bill would eliminate base and Overseas \nContingency Operations JUONF funding, critical to DOD's ability to quickly respond to urgent \nwarfighter needs and effectively address Combatant Commanders' urgent operational requirements \nin a timely manner.  \n \nDeep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Spacecraft.  The level of resources the bill would \nprovide for the Air Force\u2019s Rocket Systems Launch Program would prevent DOD from launching \nthe refurbished DSCOVR spacecraft, part of an interagency partnership with the Department of  Commerce, which would provide forecasts of geomagnetic storm conditions and imminent \nwarnings of adverse solar events, helping to protect the Nation's military and economic assets \nincluding our commercial electric grid and communications and airline operations.   \n \nMedium Extended Air Defense Systems (MEADS).  The Administration appreciates the support for \nDOD's air and missile defense programs; however, the level of resources the bill would provide for \nthe MEADS program could trigger unilateral withdrawal by the U.S. from the MEADS \nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Germany and Italy, which could further lead to a \nDOD obligation to pay all contract costs \u2013 a scenario that would likely exceed the cost of satisfying \nDOD\u2019s commitment under the MOU.  This reduction also could call into question DOD's ability to \nhonor its financial commitments in other binding cooperative MOUs and have adverse \nconsequences for other international cooperative programs.   \n \nBase Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Actions.  Section 8112 of the bill would impede the \nSecretary's ability to make and implement force management decisions that would ensure resources \nare directed to the highest priorities. \n \nInvestment in Innovation.  The bill\u2019s funding level for the Defense Advanced Research Projects \nAgency for high-priority science and technology programs would undermine the Nation\u2019s ability to \ninvest in innovation and ideas that would have long-term benefits for the country\u2019s national security \nand economy. \n \nAssured SATCOM Services In Single Theater (ASSIST).  Acquiring the satellite as part of the \nASSIST program as proposed in the 2012 Budget would be far more cost effective than the \nCommittee's proposed alternative which would result in DOD continuing to lease commercial \nsatellites while procuring a Wideband Global Satellite that would not be ready for many years.  \n \nC-17 Transport Aircraft.  Additional funding for an unrequested C-17 airlift is unnecessary and \ndiverts resources that could be used for higher priority programs, since analyses by DOD have \nshown that there are already more C-17s in the force and on order than are needed to meet the \nDepartment's current and future airlift needs, even under the most stressing situations. \n \nIntelligence Community Management Account.  The reduction in funding for this account would \nimpair the Director of National Intelligence's ability to lead Intelligence Community integration and \noversight.  \n \nClassified Programs.  The Administration looks forward to providing its views on the Classified \nAnnex to the bill once it becomes available.  \n \nThe bill includes the following problematic policy and language issues: \n \nProhibition of TRICARE Prime Increases for One Year.  Language in the report, which is \nincorporated into statute by section 8006, would seek to prohibit TRICARE Prime enrollment fee \nincreases for one year.  This language is contrary to the House-passed version of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012, and would hinder implementation of the TRICARE \nproposals included in the President\u2019s Budget.  The Administration understands this language was \nadded inadvertently, and requests that it be deleted from the report.   \n \nOffice of Security Cooperation-Iraq (OSC-I).  The Department appreciates the funding provided for \nOSC-I; section 9013 of the bill does not authorize funding for Security Assistance Teams (SATs) in \n2  Iraq or the operations and activities of the OSC-I within the funds provided.  The requested funding \nsupports SATs for 2012, which is needed to accomplish the OSC-I mission.  Section 9013, as \ncurrently worded, would eliminate the Department's ability to support SATs, which implement the \nIraqi Security Forces Mission Essential Capability development program.   \n \nIntelligence Community Reprogramming Thresholds and General Transfer Authority (GTA).  The \nAdministration objects to sections 8091, 8092 and 8120, which would reduce the Director of \nNational Intelligence's ability to respond quickly to unforeseen and emergent requirements.   \n \nMilitary Information Support Operations.  Section 8119 of the bill restricts the use of funding in the \nbase budget for Information Operations/Military Information Support Operations activities.  These \nactivities are a core capability of the Department and support military objectives during peacetime \nand contingency operations.   \n \nDetainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions that limit the use of \nauthorized funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee transfers.  Although the \nAdministration opposes the release of detainees within the United States, section 8123 is a \ndangerous and extraordinary challenge to critical Executive branch authority to determine when and \nwhere to prosecute detainees, based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and national \nsecurity interests.  It unnecessarily constrains the Nation's counterterrorism efforts and would \nundermine national security, particularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 \noption for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have \nleveraged the flexibility and strength of this country's criminal justice system to incapacitate \ndangerous terrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is \nan essential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available \noption.  The certification requirement in section 8124, restricting transfers to foreign countries, \ninterferes with the authority of the Executive branch to make important foreign policy and national \nsecurity determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers should \noccur.  Broadly speaking, the detention provisions in HR 2219 seek to reduce the flexibility and \ndecision making of our military, intelligence, and law enforcement personnel.  Those professionals \nhave successfully led a Government-wide effort to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al\u2013Qa\u2019ida over \nseveral Administrations.  The Administration believes strongly that it is a mistake for members of \nCongress to overrule or limit the tactical flexibility of the Nation\u2019s counterterrorism professionals, \nincluding our military commanders, intelligence professionals, seasoned counterterrorism \nprosecutors, or other operators in the field.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations process moves forward to ensure the Administration can support enactment of the \nlegislation. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n3  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n                    May 10, 2011 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1231 \u2013 To amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to require that each 5-year \noffshore oil and gas leasing program offer leasing in the areas with the most prospective oil \nand gas resources, to establish a domestic oil and natural gas production goal, and for \nother purposes.  \n(Rep.

That strategy, among other things, includes a balanced process to \nopen new areas for leasing, prepare for the possibility of oil spills, and encourage responsible \ndevelopment of existing leases.  The Administration opposes H.R. 1231, which would undermine \nand circumvent the transparent public process for determining which new areas are appropriate \nto lease. \n \nH.R. 1231 would require the Department of the Interior (DOI) to open new areas on the Outer \nContinental Shelf (OCS) to leasing without any discretion to determine which areas are actually \nappropriate and safe for exploration and development.  The bill would have the effect of \nmandating OCS lease sales along the entire East Coast, offshore California, and elsewhere, \nwithout providing states and local citizens the opportunity to share views about where \nexploration should happen.   \n \nThe Administration is developing a 5-year (2012-2017) comprehensive plan for offshore oil and \ngas exploration and production that incorporates lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon oil \nspill.  This plan, developed through a public review process, will assess which areas of the OCS \nare appropriate for future oil and gas leasing.  In addition, the Administration is focusing on \nresources that are already available for development under existing plans.  A recent DOI report \nshows that about 70 percent of leased offshore acres are not being explored or developed.

These include investments in education, clean energy, and life-saving medical research. \nHowever, the Administration strongly opposes any attempts to include language in the \nunderlying bill that would deny funding for critical women\u2019s health services or prohibit funding \nto implement the Affordable Care Act that is making health care more affordable and accessible \nfor all Americans. \n \nThe Administration is committed to cutting spending and reducing the deficit to put the Nation \non a sustainable fiscal path.

Since 1985, our trade \nrelationship with Panama has been characterized by the unilateral trade preferences that the \nUnited States provides through the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) program.  This program has \ncontributed to economic growth and development and export diversification in Panama. \n \nThe Agreement will build on the success of the CBI program.  Today, Panama is one of the \nfastest-growing economies in the Western Hemisphere.  Most imports from Panama currently \nenter the United States duty-free, but U.S. exports to Panama face substantial tariffs.  The \nAgreement will create significant new opportunities for American workers, farmers, ranchers, \nand businesses by opening Panama's market and eliminating barriers to U.S. goods, services and \ninvestment.  Upon entry into force of the Agreement, Panama will immediately eliminate its \ntariffs on over 87 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial goods and on more than \nhalf of U.S. exports of agricultural goods, by value. \n \nThe Agreement also contains state of the art provisions to help protect and enforce intellectual \nproperty rights, reduce regulatory red tape, and eliminate regulatory barriers to U.S. exports.  \nThe Agreement contains high standards for protecting labor rights, carrying out covered \nenvironmental agreements, and ensuring that key domestic labor and environmental laws are \nenforced, combined with strong remedies for non-compliance. \n \nThe Agreement is an important part of the Administration's efforts to spur economic growth, \nincrease exports, and create jobs in the United States, while promoting our core values.  The \nAgreement forms an integral part of the Administration's larger strategy of doubling exports by \nthe end of 2014.

The President proposed these measures to the Congress as part of the American Jobs Act \nas a way to create jobs and spur economic growth.    \n \nBy extending and expanding the payroll tax cut in place this year, the bill would cut in half the \namount of payroll tax paid by employees and the self-employed on their wages and salaries for \n2012.  Approximately 160 million workers would benefit from this tax cut, with the typical \nfamily earning $50,000 seeing more than $1,500 in additional take-home pay.   \n \nThe bill would also cut in half the payroll tax paid by employers on the first $5 million of taxable \npayroll for 2012.  This provision would benefit all businesses, but would target the benefit to the \n98 percent of firms with payrolls below the $5 million payroll threshold.  The bill would also \ncompletely eliminate the payroll tax paid on added workers and on wage increases for current \nworkers for the first $12.5 million of an employer's increased taxable payroll for the 4th quarter \nof 2011 and the first $50 million in increased payroll for 2012.

In addition, the bill would seriously weaken the Bureau\u2019s decision-making \npower by making the head of the CFPB a five-person commission rather than a single Director, \nsignificantly limiting the Bureau\u2019s ability to effectively respond to the rapid changes in the dynamic \nconsumer financial products and services market.  Finally, H.R. 1315 would compromise the \nindependence of the CFPB by imposing unwarranted restrictions on a Bureau that is already subject \nto significant oversight.  The CFPB is the only banking regulator whose rules can be set aside by a \ncouncil made up of other Federal agencies.  H.R. 1315 would go beyond this already stringent \nlimitation by making it easier for the Financial Stability Oversight Council to set aside CFPB rules \nand regulations, which would significantly impede the Bureau\u2019s ability to protect American \nconsumers from unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices.  \n \nH.R. 1315 would significantly interfere with the CFPB\u2019s charge to make consumer financial \nmarkets operate more efficiently and effectively, facilitate innovation in the marketplace, protect \nconsumers\u2019 interests, and ensure that consumers have the information they need to make prudent \nfinancial decisions.  The President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend that the President veto any \nbill, including H.R. 1315, that makes the Nation\u2019s economy more vulnerable to another devastating \nfinancial crisis by undermining the core reforms included in the Dodd-Frank Act.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nApril 4, 2011 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.J.

Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2017, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012.  The \nAdministration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means and reducing the \ndeficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  That is why the \nPresident put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, \nsupports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, and meets \nthe commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their \ncircumstances.   \n \nWhile overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of \nongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional \nleadership on the Nation\u2019s long-term fiscal picture, the bill provides insufficient funding for a \nnumber of programs in a way that undermines core government functions and investments key to \neconomic growth and job creation.  Programs adversely affected by the bill include: \n \nTransportation Security Administration Passenger Security Fee.  The Administration is \nconcerned that the Committee bill fails to reform the aviation passenger security fee.   \n \nState and Local Grant Programs.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee bill \ninsufficiently funds the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s State and local grants, \nincluding Assistance to Firefighter Grants.  The funding level provided will adversely impact the \nentire portfolio of preparedness grants to State, local, tribal jurisdictions, and the transportation \nsector.  Further, funding the SAFER program at the Committee\u2019s level would reduce the number \nof firefighters funded by approximately 2,200 positions.  Although large balances remain \navailable in these programs, State and local governments depend on this funding to support \nongoing homeland security prevention and preparedness programs and ensure that all levels of \ngovernment have the capacity to adequately respond to threats.  The Administration supports and \nappreciates the flexibility given to the Secretary to allocate limited homeland security grant \nfunding to those areas deemed most critical. \n \nScience and Technology Research Funding.  The funding for research and development provided \nin the Committee\u2019s bill would limit the domestic investment in developing new capabilities to \nefficiently meet the demands of current and emerging homeland security threats through the \nelimination of more than 144 research projects in areas such as biological and explosives \ndetection, advanced cyber security, and interoperability.  Without domestic investment in new \ntechnologies and solutions targeted specifically at the homeland security threat, the United States \nwill become increasingly dependent on foreign countries for any advances in homeland security \ntechnology. \n  Coast Guard Fast Response Cutter and Shore Projects.  The Committee bill provides \ninsufficient funds for key acquisition programs that will allow for the recapitalization of aging \nassets. The level of funding provided for Fast Response Cutters will unnecessarily delay \nproduction and increase future costs by delaying purchase of the proprietary specifications that \nare needed to replace aging patrol boats. Further, the funding level for shore and housing projects \nwill deprive Coast Guard families of suitable housing in duty stations where housing market \nshortfalls exist and eliminate high priority shore projects that directly affect operations. \n \nTransportation Security Administration.  The funding level in the Committee bill for the \nTransportation Security Administration\u2019s Federal Air Marshal Service will result in either \nreduced staffing in 2012 or curtailed domestic mission coverage on priority aviation flights. \nFurther, the funding provided will not permit the deployment of 275 additional advanced \nimaging technology systems, which is an important tool for detecting both metallic and non-\nmetallic threats as part of the aviation passenger screening process. \n \nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF).  The \nAdministration will continue to closely monitor Disaster Relief Fund balances and work with the \nCongress to ensure Fund solvency.  The Administration, however, strongly objects to proposed \nlanguage that would direct the President to submit a budget amendment or supplemental \nappropriations request with associated offsets when the Fund dips below a certain threshold.  The \nAdministration would view this provision as advisory.  \n \nHeadquarters Consolidation and Operation.  The Committee bill would delay the consolidation \nof the Department of Homeland Security headquarters by at least two years, resulting in higher \nlease costs and will mean the loss of construction efficiencies and increased future construction \ncosts. The funding provided in the bill for the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management \nwould result in a reduction-in-force. \n \nThe Administration also has a number of serious constitutional concerns.  The Administration \nstrongly objects to the provisions of section 537 that limit the use of funds to transfer detainees \nand otherwise restrict detainee transfers.  Although the Administration opposes the release of \ndetainees within the United States, section 537 is a dangerous and extraordinary challenge to \ncritical Executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute detainees, based \non the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests.   It \nunnecessarily constrains the Nation's counterterrorism efforts and would undermine national \nsecurity, particularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 option for \nincapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have \nleveraged the flexibility and strength of this country\u2019s Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous \nterrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an \nessential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available \noption.   \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes any inclusion of ideological and political provisions that \nare beyond the scope of funding legislation.   Should the Congress continue to include language \nthat is not relevant to a funding debate, the Administration will oppose the bill. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations process moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n  July 10, 2012 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 4402 \u2013 National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act \n(Rep. Amodei, R-NV, and 27 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4402, which, though vaguely worded, would \nundermine and remove the environmental safeguards, for, at a minimum, almost all types of \nhardrock mines on Federal lands. Notwithstanding the title and the stated purpose of the \nlegislation, H.R. 4402, as reported by the House Natural Resources Committee, is drafted in such \na manner as to cover virtually all hardrock mining on Federal lands.  Protection of the public \nthrough sound Federal decision-making would be circumvented by the bill's provisions, which \ninclude, among other things, the elimination of appropriate reviews under the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act and the circumvention of public involvement in and the formulation of \nalternatives to any mining proposal.  The Administration strongly supports the development of \nrare earth elements and other critical minerals, but rejects the notion that their development is \nincongruent with environmental protection and public involvement in agency decision-making.  \n \nThe legislation also undermines existing law calling for the multiple uses of public lands by \nplacing mining interests above all other uses.  This change has the potential to threaten hunting, \nfishing, recreation and other activities which create jobs and sustain local economies across the \ncountry.  Furthermore, the Administration opposes the legislation's severe restrictions on judicial \nreview.  While the legislation purports to limit litigation, its extremely short statute of limitations \nand vague constraints on the scope of prospective relief that a court may issue are likely to have \nthe opposite effect. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  May 7, 2012 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5326 \u2212 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2013 \n(Rep.

The BCA created \na framework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that \nwould bring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national \npriorities.  Departing from the bipartisan agreement reached in the BCA and departing from \nthese caps, the House of Representatives put forward a topline discretionary funding level for \nFY 2013 that, for example, would cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially seniors, \nveterans, and children \u2013 as well as degrade many of the basic Government services on which the \nAmerican people rely such as air traffic control and law enforcement.  In addition, these cuts \nwere made in the context of a budget that fails the test of balance, fairness, and shared \nresponsibility by giving millionaires and billionaires a tax cut and paying for it through deep \ncuts, including to discretionary programs.   \n \nTaking this into account, passing H.R. 5326 at its current funding level would mean that when \nthe Congress constructs other appropriations bills, it would necessitate significant and harmful \ncuts to critical national priorities such as education, research and development, job training, and \nhealth care.  Furthermore, the bill undermines key investments in resource management, export \npromotion, community safety, access to justice, and space flight.  Investing in these areas is \ncritical to the Nation's economic growth, security, and global competitiveness.  The \nAdministration also strongly objects to the inclusion of ideological and political provisions that \nare beyond the scope of funding legislation.  \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5326, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Commerce \n \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The Administration strongly \nopposes the $93 million reduction in funding from the FY 2013 Budget request for NOAA.  This \ncut would impact negatively NOAA's ability to support the Nation's fisheries and oceans \nstewardship programs such as protected species programs, which would be cut by $16 million  below the FY 2013 Budget request and $20 million below the FY 2012 enacted level.  Decreased \nfunding for Protected Species Research and Management could lead to delays in permitting or \nconsultations and result in the development of less precise measures, which could have economic \nimpacts on coastal industries such as fisheries, agriculture, oil and gas development, and coastal \nconstruction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for mission-critical \nsatellite programs.   \n \nCensus Bureau.  The Administration opposes the $92 million reduction from the FY 2013 \nBudget request.  The cut below the FY 2012 enacted level threatens the Bureau's ability to \nimplement Economic Census data collection activities that peak in FY 2013, hindering the \nsuccessful development of critical benchmarks for Gross Domestic Product estimates.  The bill \nalso does not provide sufficient funding for 2020 Decennial Census Planning, adversely \nimpacting Census research and testing activities that inform the development of an accurate and \ncost-efficient decennial census.  \n \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The Administration opposes the \ndecision to not include funding for the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace \n(NSTIC).  The continued Government support of NSTIC pilot projects, as proposed in the \nPresident's FY 2013 Budget, is required to demonstrate new identity management solutions that \nwill protect individuals, businesses, and agencies from cyber-crimes.  The Administration \nappreciates the Committee's support for NIST intramural research and manufacturing initiatives.   \n \nInternational Trade Administration (ITA).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the \nrequested funding level of $517 million for ITA, which plays an important role in increasing \nU.S. exports.  The Administration strongly encourages the full request be provided for the \nInteragency Trade Enforcement Center and SelectUSA initiatives, which will help protect \nagainst unfair trade practices and promote investment and jobs.  Without the requested funding, \nITA would have to dramatically scale back its export promotion and counseling efforts, both \ndomestically and overseas.  This would result in fewer additional American exports, particularly \nby small businesses, and fewer new American jobs.    \n \nDepartment of Justice \n \nState and Local Assistance.  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided \nfor the Community Oriented Policing Services Hiring Grants Program, which is $217 million \nbelow the FY 2013 Budget request.  This reduced funding level would result in the loss of \napproximately 1,200 police hires/rehires, including veterans.  In addition, some communities \nseriously impacted by crime would not be able to support enough police officers to effectively \nrespond.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fund the Byrne Justice Assistance \nGrant program at the requested level of $430 million, which will provide much-needed \nassistance to help State and local law enforcement address crime.  \n \nExecutive Office of the President \n \nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).  The Administration opposes the reduction from \nthe FY 2013 Budget request for USTR.  The bill does not fully fund the Interagency Trade \nEnforcement Center, a coordinated interagency approach to enhance trade enforcement which \nlevels the playing field for U.S. workers and businesses.   \n \n2  Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee's support for the FY 2013 Budget request of $5.85 million.  This funding enables \nOSTP to leverage its scientific and technical expertise to address the Nation's science and \ntechnology challenges.  \n \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided for the commercial crew \nprogram, which is $330 million below the FY 2013 Budget request, as well as restrictive report \nlanguage that would eliminate competition in the program.  This would increase the time the \nUnited States will be required to rely solely on foreign providers to transport American \nastronauts to and from the space station.  While the Administration appreciates the overall \nfunding level provided to NASA, the bill provides some NASA programs with unnecessary \nincreases at the expense of other important initiatives. \n \nNational Science Foundation (NSF) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the funding level of $7.3 billion provided for NSF, which is \n$300 million above the FY 2012 enacted level.  The funding would support over 400 additional \nresearch and education awards compared to FY 2012.  \n \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) \n \nThe Administration is concerned about the Committee's funding level for EEOC, which is \n$7 million less than the FY 2013 Budget request.  Funding at this level would prevent EEOC \nfrom filling critical investigator positions lost through attrition, which would increase EEOC's \nbacklog and weaken its ability to enforce Federal laws that protect individuals from \ndiscrimination based on their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetic \ninformation. \n \nLegal Services Corporation (LSC) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided in the bill for LSC, which is \n$74 million below the FY 2013 Budget request.  At this funding level, tens of thousands of low-\nincome Americans, including many military families and veterans, would be denied assistance \nwith civil legal problems, impacting their ability to receive fair treatment in the courts.  \n \nRiders \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders that have no place \nin funding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill: \n \nReasonable Factors Other Than Age Rule.  Preventing the implementation of this Rule under the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act would prevent the EEOC from bringing its regulations \ninto line with Supreme Court decisions and perpetuate uncertainty surrounding the defenses to an \nage discrimination claim, resulting in inconsistent litigation outcomes for both individuals and \nemployers.  \n3   \nProhibition on Multiple Sales of Rifles Reporting Requirement.

This provision's restrictions on the transfer of detainees to the United States in the \ncontext of an ongoing armed conflict may interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to \ndetermine the appropriate disposition of detainees and to make important foreign policy and \nnational security determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers \nshould occur.  Such restrictions or interferences would, in certain circumstances, violate \nconstitutional separation of powers principles. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n4  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nApril 23, 2012 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS.J.

J. Res. 10 would set a severe and unrealistic spending cap that would undercut the Federal \nGovernment\u2019s ability to meet its core commitments to seniors, middle class families and the \nmost vulnerable, while reducing our ability to invest in our future.  This cap could result in \nsevere cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security that are growing due to the retirement \nof the baby boomers, putting at risk the retirement security of millions of Americans, and it could \nresult in significant cuts to education, research and development, and other programs critical to \ngrowing our economy and winning the future.   \n \nS. J. Res. 10 also would impose serious risks for our economy.  It risks accelerating economic \ndownturns by requiring the government to raise taxes and cut spending in the face of a \ncontraction, which would accelerate job losses.  The President proposed a balanced approach to \nrestore fiscal sustainability and in a way that does not slow the Federal Government's ability to \ninitiate actions that help stabilize the economy and keep future recessions from becoming worse.  \nBy contrast, under S.

Since the enactment of the CWA in 1972, the Federal \nGovernment has protected the waterways our citizens depend on by using its checks and \nbalances authority to review and adjust key State water pollution control decisions, where \nnecessary, to assure that they reflect up to date science, comply with the law, and protect \ndownstream water users in other States.  H.R. 2018 would roll back the key provisions of the \nCWA that have been the underpinning of 40 years of progress in making the Nation\u2019s waters \nfishable, swimmable, and drinkable.     \n \nH.R. 2018 could limit efforts to safeguard communities by removing the Federal Government\u2019s \nauthority to take action when State water quality standards are not protective of public health.  In \naddition, it would restrict EPA\u2019s authority to take action when it finds that a State\u2019s CWA permit \nor permit program is inadequate and would shorten EPA\u2019s review and collaboration with the \nArmy Corps of Engineers on permits for dredged or fill material.  All of these changes could \nresult in adverse impacts to human health, the economy, and the environment through increased \npollution and degradation of water bodies that serve as venues for recreation and tourism, and \nthat provide drinking water sources and habitat for fish and wildlife.  \n \nH.R. 2018 would disrupt the carefully constructed complementary CWA roles for EPA, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, and States in protecting water quality.  It also could eliminate EPA\u2019s \nability to protect water quality and public health in downstream States from actions in upstream \nStates, and could increase the number of lawsuits challenging State permits.

H.R. 4078, the Regulatory Freeze for Jobs Act, would undermine \ncritical public health and safety protections, introduce needless complexity and uncertainty in \nagency decision-making, and interfere with agency performance of statutory mandates.  \nAccordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4078. \nWhen a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and well \nunderstood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction \nAct, and the Congressional Review Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been \ngoverned by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  \nThese require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations upon a reasoned determination that \nthe benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory \nflexibility. \n \nThis Administration is committed to a regulatory system that is informed by science, cost-justified, \nand consistent with economic growth.  Through Executive Order and the direction of the \nPresident, agencies must also ensure that they take into account the consequences of rulemaking \non small businesses.  Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased \npublic participation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory \napproaches, and a regulatory retrospective review.  Through Executive Orders 13579 and 13610, \nthe Administration also has taken important steps to promote systematic retrospective review of \nregulations by all agencies.  Collectively, these requirements promote flexible, commonsense, \ncost-effective regulation. \n \nPassage of H.R. 4078 would seriously undermine the existing framework.  H.R. 4078 would also \nadd layers of procedural burdens that would interfere with agency performance of statutory \nmandates, unnecessarily delay important public health and safety protections, and undermine and \npotentially delay important environmental reviews.  For example, H.R. 4078 would create \nexcessively complex permitting processes that would hamper economic growth.  It would also \nspawn excessive regulatory litigation, and introduce redundant processes for litigation \nsettlements.  It also addresses numerous problems that do not exist, such as a moratorium on \n\"midnight\" rules.

The Agreement eliminates tariffs on over 95 percent of U.S. \nexports of industrial and consumer goods to Korea within the first five years and, together with \nthe agreement entered into through an exchange of letters in February 2011, addresses the \nconcerns of American automakers and workers regarding the lack of a level playing field in \nKorea's auto market.

In addition, the Agreement will \ngive American service providers greater access to Korea's $580 billion services market. \n \nThe Agreement forms an integral part of the Administration's larger strategy of doubling exports \nby the end of 2014.  The Agreement contains state of the art provisions to help protect and \nenforce intellectual property rights, reduce regulatory red tape, and eliminate regulatory barriers \nto U.S. exports.

Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of \nH.R. 3010, the Regulatory Accountability Act.  The Regulatory Accountability Act would \nimpose unprecedented procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from \nperforming their statutory responsibilities.  It would also create needless regulatory and legal \nuncertainty and increase costs for businesses, as well as state, tribal, and local governments, and \nfurther impede the implementation of commonsense protections for the American public. \nThe Regulatory Accountability Act would impose unnecessary new procedures on agencies and \ninvite frivolous litigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, it must already \nadhere to the requirements of the statute that it is implementing.  In many cases, the Congress \nhas mandated that the agency issue the particular rule or regulation, and it often prescribes the \nprocess the agency must follow.  Agencies must also adhere to the robust and well understood \nprocedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, and major rules are subject to the \nrequirements of other Federal statutes such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act.  In addition, for decades, agency \nrulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of \nboth political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations only upon a \nreasoned determination that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs, to consider \nregulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  Lastly, final regulations are subject \nto review by the Federal courts to ensure that agencies satisfy the substantive and procedural \nrequirements of all applicable statutes and consider input from the relevant stakeholders. \nPassage of H.R. 3010 would replace this time-honored framework with layers of additional \nprocedural requirements that would seriously undermine the ability of agencies to execute their \nstatutory mandates.  It would require cumbersome \u201cformal\u201d rulemaking for a new category of \nrules, for which agencies would have to conduct quasi-adjudicatory proceedings.  It would \nimpose unnecessary new evidentiary standards as a condition of rulemaking.  It would subject \nthe regulatory process to unneeded rounds of litigation.

These important changes include: ending the worst \npractices of insurance companies; giving uninsured individuals and small business owners the \nsame kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress have; and bringing \ndown the cost of health care for families and businesses while also reducing Federal budget \ndeficits.  \n \nAs the President indicated in the State of the Union, the Administration is eager to work with the \nCongress to improve the Affordable Care Act by making care better or more affordable.  Rather \nthan making refinements to improve the law, H.R. 1213 simply proposes to eliminate funding.  It \nwould not advance the key objectives of the Affordable Care Act or offer alternative solutions \nfor meeting these important objectives, and the bill may make it harder to achieve better and \nmore affordable care.  H.R. 1213 would eliminate funding for grants to States to establish State-\nbased health insurance Exchanges in 2014.   \n \nExchanges will allow Americans to compare prices and health insurance plans and decide which \nquality, affordable option is right for them.  These grants are critical support to help States \ndevelop and begin operation of Exchanges that will be able to perform these functions.

Weakening these \nstandards would allow more pollution in the air we breathe and threaten the health of Americans \nacross the country.  A recent report by EPA shows how important this landmark law has been in \nprotecting public health.  In 2010 alone, just one part of the CAA prevented: \n \n\u2022  160,000 premature deaths; \n \n\u2022  130,000 heart attacks; \n \n\u2022  More than 100,000 hospital visits by preventing millions of cases of respiratory \nproblems, including bronchitis and asthma.  It enhanced productivity by preventing \nmillions of lost workdays, and kept kids healthy and in school, avoiding millions of lost \nschool days due to respiratory illness and other diseases caused or exacerbated by air \npollution. \n \nSince 1970, the CAA has reduced key air pollutants that cause smog and particulate pollution by \nmore than 60 percent.  At the same time the economy has more than tripled.  And since the CAA \nAmendments in 1990, electricity production is up and prices are stable.  In 2009, electric utilities \ndelivered 33 percent more electricity to U.S. households and businesses than in 1990, while \nnationwide electricity prices remained essentially unchanged. \n \nOver its 40-year span, the benefits of the CAA \u2013 in the form of longer lives, healthier kids, \ngreater workforce productivity, and ecosystem protections \u2013 outweigh the costs by more than 30 \nto one. \n \nPassage of H.R. 910 would also block important policy measures that enable the CAA to achieve \nadditional societal benefits related to carbon pollution.  For example, the bill would block EPA's \ninvolvement in the historic, bipartisan Federal program to promote vehicle fuel economy \nstandards for Model Years 2017-2025.  This program will reduce oil consumption, provide \nsignificant savings to American consumers at the pump, and limit pollution from tailpipe \nemissions.  Further, H.R. 910 would second guess the widely-accepted scientific consensus that  carbon pollution is at increasingly dangerous concentrations and is contributing to the threat of \nclimate change.  This could create uncertainty around the requirements which are currently in \neffect for the Model Year 2012-2016 vehicle standards.  Finally, H.R. 910 would contradict \npublic health experts and scientists and strip EPA of its authority to develop sensible standards \nfor currently unchecked carbon pollution, and thus prevent EPA from following its statutory \nobligations as interpreted by the Supreme Court. \n \nIf the President is presented with this legislation, which would seriously roll back the CAA \nauthority, harm Americans\u2019 health by taking away our ability to decrease carbon pollution, and \nundercut fuel efficiency standards that will save Americans money at the pump while decreasing \nour dependence on oil, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \nJuly 06, 2011 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2354 \u2014 Energy and Water Appropriations Act, 2012 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on H.R. 2354, making \nappropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2012.  The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means \nand reducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  \nThat is why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 \ntrillion, supports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, meets \nthe commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their circumstances, \nand provides for our national security.  \n \nWhile overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of \nongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership \non the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, the Administration has concerns regarding the level of \nresources the bill would provide for a number of programs in a way that undermines core \ngovernment functions, investments key to economic growth and job creation, as well as national \nsecurity.  Programs adversely affected by the bill include: \n \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) \n \nClean Energy Research and Development (R&D).  The level of funding provided for R&D of \nrenewable energy and energy efficient technologies would undermine the ability of the United \nStates to develop a clean energy economy and create jobs for the future.  By reducing funds for key \nprograms including Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy, the Energy Efficiency and \nRenewable Energy program, and the Office of Science, the bill places at risk U.S. competitiveness \nin technologies and expanding markets such as electric vehicles and batteries, new \"drop-in\" \nhydrocarbon biofuels, cost-saving energy-efficient systems for homes and businesses, advanced \nmanufacturing materials and processes, and cost-competitive solar energy and offshore wind power. \n \nClimate Research.  The funding level for the Office of Science's Biological and Environmental \nResearch program would hamper the Administration\u2019s efforts to conduct and support scientific \nresearch on the relationship between energy production and the environment.  The Administration \nalso strongly disagrees with the Committee Report suggestion that climate and atmospheric research \nare unrelated to DOE's core basic science mission.   \n \nInnovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program (Title XVII).  The bill significantly reduces credit \nsubsidy budget authority for the Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program, which helps finance \nrenewable energy and efficient end-use projects.  The bill also does not provide any additional loan \nvolume authority for nuclear power projects or any of the requested funds for a new Better Building \nPilot Loan Guarantee Program.  These programs are an important part of the Nation's efforts to \ndeploy innovative clean energy technologies, and these reductions may slow progress toward a  clean energy future. \n \nYucca Mountain License.  Continued funding of the Yucca Mountain license application will divert \nfunds from the Nation\u2019s efforts to advance fuel cycle technologies and develop waste management \noptions.  The Administration has established a Blue Ribbon Commission to inform the development \nof a new strategy for nuclear waste management and disposal.   \n \nEnvironmental Management.  The level of resources in the bill may affect DOE's ability to meet its \ngoals for cleaning up legacy waste from its nuclear programs. \nNuclear Posture Review Goals and Maintaining a Safe, Secure and Effective Nuclear Deterrent. \nThe Administration objects to the funding reduction in Title III, Weapons Activities, which will \ndelay the achievement of a number of important Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) goals.  The full \nrequest supports the Administration's commitment to modernization of the nuclear weapons \ncomplex made in the NPR and reaffirmed as part of the New START treaty ratification process.  \n  \nDefense Nuclear Nonproliferation.  The Administration objects to funding reductions in Title III, \nDefense Nuclear Nonproliferation in the Fissile Materials Disposition and Highly Enriched \nUranium (HEU) Reactor Conversion.  These reductions will undermine U.S. ability to begin \ndisposing plutonium in 2018 and delay efforts to reduce usage of HEU in nuclear reactors \nworldwide. \n \nCorps of Engineers (Corps)  \n \nConstruction and New Starts.  The bill provides excess funding for the Corps' construction program \nwhile also underfunding some of the highest priority construction projects, including the South \nFlorida Ecosystem Restoration Program, a nationally significant effort that includes the Everglades.  \nThe bill's \"no new start\" prohibition would preclude funding the limited number of priority new \nstarts in the President's Budget, including an important new program to reverse damage to the \ncoastal Louisiana ecosystem and a study called for by the Congress to examine flood risks \nnationwide in order to improve existing programs.   \n \nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation \n \nIndian Water Rights Settlements.  Absorbing funding for Indian water settlements in the Bureau's \nprimary funding account would limit the Bureau's ability to fund other high priority programs, such \nas its water conservation activities. \n \nSan Joaquin Rescission.  Rescinding unobligated balances from the San Joaquin Restoration Fund \nwould undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish \npopulations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts. \n \nDepartment of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration \n \nHigh Speed Rail Balances.  The Administration opposes the rescission of unobligated balances that \nhave already been competitively awarded to projects across the country.  These projects will create \njobs and make needed improvements to the intercity passenger rail network.  Rescinding funds now \nwould significantly disrupt States' planning and construction efforts, which count on their \ncommitted amounts.  \n \n2  The bill includes the following problematic policy and language issues:  \n \nClean Water Act.  Section 109 of the bill would stop an important Administration effort to provide \nclarity around which water bodies are covered by the Clean Water Act.  The Administration\u2019s work \nin this area will help to protect the public health and economic benefits provided to the American \npublic by clean water, while also bringing greater certainty to business planning and investment and \nreducing an ongoing loss of wetlands and other sensitive aquatic resources.  The existing \nregulations were the subject of two recent Supreme Court cases, in which the Court itself indicated \nthe need for greater regulatory clarity regarding the appropriate scope of the Clean Water Act \njurisdiction.  \n \nFighting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.  The Administration is concerned with sections 606 and 607 of \nthe bill and looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve the intended purpose of \nprotecting the interest of the Nation's taxpayers, which is consistent with the Administration's \nefforts to fight fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal contracts, grants, and other Federal assistance. \n \nInnovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program (Title XVII).  Section 312 of the bill, requiring \nrelease of pre-decisional, business-sensitive information, could negatively impact the Title XVII \nloan program, potential applicants, and related private-sector entities.  Not protecting business-\nsensitive information of applicants to the program could have significant market implications for the \ncompanies and could encourage \"gaming the system\" by applicants, including by discouraging them \nfrom sharing information with the Department which is critical to ensuring the Government \nestablishes accurate cost estimates. \n \nRegulatory Restriction.  Section 313 of the bill unnecessarily limits and delays the Department's \nactivities on regulations as defined under Executive Order 12866 for energy efficient appliances and \npotentially other regulatory activities. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations process moves forward.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \nDecember 6, 2011 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.

This \nincludes investments to improve the Nation's airports, support NextGen Air Traffic \nModernization efforts, and provide resources for the TIGER and TIFIA programs, which target \ncompetitive dollars to innovative multi-modal infrastructure programs.  S. 1769 will also take \nspecial steps to enhance infrastructure-related job training opportunities for individuals from \nunderrepresented groups and ensure that small businesses can compete for infrastructure \ncontracts.

The legislation makes the largest \nannual spending cuts in the Nation\u2019s history, while at the same time investing in America's future \nin significant ways.  Although the Administration would not have agreed to many of these cuts \nunder better fiscal circumstances, the bill reflects a compromise that will help the Federal \nGovernment live within its means while protecting those investments that will help America \ncompete for new jobs.  These include investments in education, clean energy, and life-saving \nmedical research.

Denham, R-California, and 31 cosponsors) \n \nWhile the Administration appreciates that H.R. 1734 would pursue reforms to the Federal \nGovernment's real estate portfolio, the Administration believes H.R. 1734 does not go far enough to \ncreate a transformative process that would save taxpayers billions of dollars. \n \nIn May 2011, the Administration proposed a bill to Congress that would usher in a new approach to \nFederal real estate.  Building on the successful model established by the Defense Base Closure and \nRealignment (BRAC) Commission, the Administration\u2019s proposal would create an independent \nBoard of experts to identify opportunities to consolidate, reduce, and realign the Federal civilian \nreal estate footprint as well as expedite the disposal of properties.  This proposal would use bundled \nrecommendations, a fast-track congressional procedure, streamlined disposal and consolidation \nauthorities, and a revolving fund replenished by proceeds to provide logistical and financial support \nto agencies in their disposal of high-value properties.  It would serve as a comprehensive solution to \nkey obstacles such as red tape and competing stakeholder interests that prevent the Federal \nGovernment from effectively managing its real estate holdings.  The proposal would also make a \nsignificant contribution to deficit reduction by sending a majority of the proceeds from the sale of \nFederal real estate to the General Treasury for deficit reduction.  \n \nSimilar to the Administration's proposal, H.R. 1734 would create a Commission that would \nrecommend Federal civilian real estate holdings for sale, consolidation, co-location, or \nreconfiguration.  In particular, this Commission would be able to identify high-value properties that \nmay be candidates to move off the government's books.  Bringing these high-value properties to \npublic debate could provide momentum for the Federal Government's efforts to downsize and \noperate in a more efficient manner, and increase transparency and understanding of the Federal \nGovernment's current real estate footprint.  However, as currently drafted, H.R. 1734 does not go \nfar enough in empowering the Commission to ensure that unneeded properties are moved off the \nFederal books.  Specifically, the Commission's recommendations, as approved by the President, \nwould not go into effect unless Congress adopts them by joint resolution.  This approach is \ninconsistent with the Administration's proposed procedural model for real estate disposal that \nproved effective under BRAC in overcoming the competing stakeholder interests that have \nhistorically slowed progress in this area.   \n \nThe Administration opposes an expansion of the properties exempted from consideration by the \nCommission beyond the safeguards and exemptions contained in the Administration's proposed \nCivilian Property Realignment Act.  Unlike the President's proposal, H.R. 1734 provides broad \ncategorical exemptions, which would limit the Commission's ability to compile a comprehensive \nlist of properties for consideration by Congress and the American public, and would therefore limit \nthe potential savings that could be achieved by aggressively pursuing real estate reform.  The \nAdministration also opposes limiting the applicability of the National Environmental Policy Act \n(NEPA) and not giving due consideration to important environmental factors when evaluating  which properties to propose for disposal. \n \nFinally, the Administration opposes zeroing out the authorization for GSA's New Construction \nbudget for FY12.  While resources have already been appropriated in FY 2012, it is a dangerous \nprecedent to attempt to zero out construction spending in this account.

Forty years of clean air regulation has shown that a strong \neconomy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand. \n \nS.J.Res. 27 would undermine this progress by blocking the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule \n(CSAPR), which would reduce harmful air pollution from power plants that threatens the health \nof downwind communities, especially the health of children, seniors, and other vulnerable \npopulations.  The CSAPR responds to a 2008 court decision directing EPA to replace the prior \nAdministration's rule with a new rule to address the transport of air pollution across State \nboundaries.  Each year, this rule would avoid tens of thousands of premature deaths, prevent \nmore than ten thousand heart attacks and hospital visits for respiratory and cardiovascular \ndisease, and alleviate hundreds of thousands of childhood asthma attacks and other respiratory \nillnesses.  The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that this flexible, commonsense rule \nwill yield hundreds of billions of dollars in net benefits each year.

The restoration \nof predictable long-term funding for aviation programs is not only critical to the safety of the \ntraveling public, but will improve the Nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure and generate new \njobs and economic growth.  While the Administration supports the enactment of a multiyear \nreauthorization bill, the funding levels in the bill for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \noperations and air traffic modernization represent significant reductions from levels proposed by \nthe Administration.  If funding were appropriated at the levels proposed in the bill, the safe and \nefficient movement of air traffic in the air and on the ground would be degraded \u2013 today and in \nthe future.   \n \nThe Administration reiterates its strong opposition to Section 903 of H.R. 658 which, like \nlegislation that the Administration strongly opposed last year, would undermine a fundamental \nprinciple of fairness in union representation elections \u2013 that outcomes should be determined by a \nmajority of the valid ballots cast.

The Administration is committed to help \nworking Americans exercise their right to organize under a fair and free process and bargain for \na fair share of the wealth their efforts help to create.  The fairest and most effective way to \ndetermine the outcome of a union representation election is by the majority of votes cast.  \n \nIf the President is presented with a bill that would not safeguard the ability of railroad and airline \nworkers to decide whether or not they would be represented by a union based upon a majority of \nthe ballots cast in an election or that would degrade safe and efficient air traffic, his senior \nadvisers would recommend that he veto the bill.

Rogers, R-KY) \n \nLast summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on \na sustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  The BCA created \na framework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that \nwould bring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national \npriorities.  Departing from the bipartisan agreement reached in the BCA and departing from the \ncaps it put in place, the House of Representatives put forward a topline discretionary funding \nlevel for fiscal year (FY) 2013 that would cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially \nseniors, veterans, and children.  The funding level would also degrade many of the basic \nGovernment services on which the American people rely such as air traffic control and law \nenforcement.  In addition, these cuts were made in the context of a budget that fails the test of \nbalance, fairness, and shared responsibility by giving millionaires and billionaires a tax cut and \npaying for it through deep cuts, including to discretionary programs. \n \nThe appropriations bill for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies \nfunds critical priorities, but given the House's topline discretionary level for FY 2013, enactment \nof H.R. 5854 would require harmful cuts to other critical priorities such as education, research \nand development, job training, and health care as other appropriations bills are constructed.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5854, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of H.R. 5854, making appropriations for military construction, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2013, and for other purposes. \n \nMilitary Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for critical \nmilitary construction projects, but strongly opposes incremental funding of the Aegis Ashore \nMissile Defense System Complex in Romania.  The incremental funding of this project runs \ncounter to sound budgeting principles and fiscal discipline. \n \nCivilian Pay Freeze.  The Administration objects to sections 129, 231, and 232, as well as any \nother effort to reduce pay for civilian personnel that would effectively extend the freeze on \ncivilian pay through FY 2013.  As the President stated in his FY 2013 Budget, a permanent pay  freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.  The Administration encourages the Congress to \nsupport the proposed 0.5 percent pay raise.  \n \nArlington National Cemetery (ANC).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support \nfor ANC programs, which will help address the Cemetery's burial and other operating issues.  \n \nRider \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders that have no place \nin funding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provision in this bill: \n \nProject Labor Agreements (PLAs).  The Administration strongly opposes the provision that \nwould effectively prohibit use of project labor agreements on Federal construction projects \nfunded under this bill.  PLAs can provide structure and stability to large construction projects, \nand allow agencies to complete these projects more efficiently.  They can also help ensure \ncompliance with laws and regulations governing workplace safety and health, equal employment \nopportunity, and labor and employment standards. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \nJune 19, 2012 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 4480 \u2013 Domestic Energy and Jobs Act \n(Rep.

Linking a drawdown of the \nSPR with the leasing of Federal lands for energy production is entirely without rational basis, either \ntemporally, spatially, or in terms of the Nation's energy needs. \n \nH.R. 4480 also would reverse Administration oil and gas leasing reforms that have established orderly, \nopen, efficient, and environmentally sound processes for energy development on public lands.  \nSpecifically, this bill would favor an arbitrary standard for leasing in open areas over leasing on the \nbasis of greatest resource potential; limit the public's opportunity to engage in decisions about the use \nof public lands as well as protests of oil and gas leases; raise the potential for costly litigation, protests, \nand delays; curtail the use of public lands for other uses like hunting, fishing, and recreation; and \nremove the environmental safeguards that ensure sound Federal leasing decision-making by \neliminating appropriate reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act. \n \nH.R. 4480 also would impede progress on important protections for the health of American families.  \nThe bill would undermine the longstanding principle of the CAA that air quality standards must be set \nat levels requisite to protect public health, based first and foremost on sound science.  The bill also \nwould impose an unnecessary and redundant requirement for analysis of certain regulations, including \nsome that have never been proposed.  The Administration supports careful consideration of the full \nbenefits and costs of regulation, which is why executive agencies already conduct comprehensive cost-\nbenefit analysis for economically significant regulations and, to the extent practicable, consider the \ncumulative effects of the regulations, as required by Executive Orders (E.O.) 12866 and 13563, as well \nas preparing a Statement of Energy Effects, as required by E.O. 13211.  By requiring that this \nduplicative analysis be submitted to the Congress, and imposing unnecessary delays before those rules \ncould be finalized, this legislation would impede the Executive branch's ability to implement \neffectively laws passed by the Congress. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4480, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the \nbill. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  October 20, 2011 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 1723 \u2013 Teachers and First Responders Back to Work Act of 2011 \n(Senator Menendez, D-New Jersey, and 9 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports passage of the Teachers and First Responders Back to \nWork Act, which will keep teachers in the classroom, police on the beat, and firefighters at work.  \nThe President sent these proposals to the Congress as part of the American Jobs Act and as a way \nto save jobs and get the economy growing again. \n \nAlthough the recession officially ended in June 2009, declining revenues and the tapering of \nsupport from the Recovery Act meant budget cuts and hundreds of thousands of layoffs at the \nState and local levels.  Additionally, in the coming school year, many school districts will have \nto make another round of difficult decisions that will cost jobs and put the education of the \nNation's children at risk. \n \nS. 1723 provides States with $30 billion in relief to support almost 400,000 educator jobs \nnationwide next year \u2013 stopping as many as 280,000 teachers from being laid off and allowing \nschool districts to go beyond that to rehire teachers or add new ones.  S. 1723 also provides $5 \nbillion to support the hiring and retention of public safety and first responder personnel.  By \nsupporting such jobs, the plan aims to keep communities safe from crime and able to maintain \ncritical emergency response capabilities.  S. 1723 is fully paid for through a surtax on those \nAmericans making over $1 million per year.  What is most important is putting Americans back \nto work right now and making sure the debt is not increased over time \u2013 and doing so in a way \nthat is fair.

At \nthe same time as the House is advancing tax cuts that benefit the most fortunate Americans, \nH.R. 5652 would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle class and vulnerable \nAmericans \u2013 especially seniors, veterans, and children. \n \nThe sequester included in the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) included mutually \ndisagreeable cuts to both defense and non-defense funding.  These cuts would have destructive \neffects on national security; on important domestic investments such as education, research and \ndevelopment, and rebuilding the Nation's crumbling infrastructure; and on core government \nprograms from air traffic control to law enforcement.  The threat of these destructive cuts under \nthe BCA was intended to be a mechanism to force action by the Congress on deficit reduction. \n \nThe President has made clear that the Congress can and must act to avoid the sweeping impacts \nof the sequester by passing a balanced deficit reduction package.  Last fall, the Administration \nprovided a blueprint for the Congress to do so.  And in his 2013 Budget, the President proposed a \ncomprehensive balanced deficit reduction package that would ensure the Nation lives within its \nmeans and, including legislation signed into law last year, reduces the deficit by $4 trillion while \nsupporting job creation and long-term economic growth.  This package would achieve more than \nenough deficit reduction to avoid the sequester. \n \nIn contrast, the approach advanced in this bill only addresses a portion of the pending sequester, \nand does so in a way that imposes far greater cuts than the sequester would entail.  The bill \nwould break the agreement on discretionary spending made in last summer's budget agreement; \nadvancing the House Budget Resolution's approach to increase defense spending and reduce \nnon-defense spending relative to the levels agreed to in the BCA.  Moreover, it would do nothing \nto address the reductions in discretionary spending and sequesters in mandatory programs after \n2013.  The bill relies entirely on spending cuts that impose a particular burden on the middle-\nclass and the most vulnerable among us, while doing nothing to raise revenue from the most \naffluent. \n \nRather than pursuing a comprehensive, balanced deficit reduction package to replace the \nsequester, H.R. 5652 undermines the intent of the BCA to bring both sides to compromise by \nproposing a short-term, one-sided solution.  This approach sharply undermines critical domestic \npriorities, such as efforts to prevent hunger and support low-income families and communities; \nto expand health care access and implement the Affordable Care Act; to protect consumers and \nimplement the Wall Street Reform Act; and to support homeowners struggling to stay in their \nhomes.  The Administration strongly opposes both the principles of this approach and specific  legislative proposals included in the bill.

The Administration looks forward to reviewing a \nclassified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns on classified programs \nas the legislative process moves forward. \n \nWhile there are many areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration has serious \nconcerns with several provisions that:  (1) constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out \ntheir missions; (2) impede the Secretary of Defense\u2019s ability to make and implement \nmanagement decisions that eliminate unnecessary overhead or programs to ensure scarce \nresources are directed to the highest priorities for the warfighter; or (3) depart from the decisions \nreflected in the President's Fiscal Year 2012 Budget Request.  The Administration looks forward \nto working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are \noutlined in more detail below.   \n \nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter Propulsion System:  The Administration strongly objects to the \nlanguage in section 215, which limits the obligation or expenditure of funds for performance \nimprovements to the F-35 Lightning II propulsion system unless there is competitive \ndevelopment and production of such a propulsion system.  As the test program unfolds, some \nimprovements are likely to be needed.  And this would result in the continued development of an \nextra engine that adds significant extra costs to the program for something the Administration \nand the Department of Defense (DoD) have determined is not needed and would destabilize the \nF-35 program when it is beginning to stabilize.  Additionally, section 215 would delay \ndevelopment of the main engine and affect the viability of the short take off and vertical landing \nvariant.  If the final bill presented to the President includes funding or a legislative direction to \ncontinue an extra engine program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto. \n \nThe Administration also strongly objects to section 252, which requires the Secretary to store  and preserve the property developed under the F136 program \u2013 a termination that ended an \nunnecessary and extravagant expense, particularly during this period of fiscal restraint.  The \nlegislation would constitute a new requirement for the preservation and storage of over 250,000 \npieces of Government property located with hundreds of suppliers and add costs for preserving \nand storing that property.   \n \nLimitations on Nuclear Force Reductions and Nuclear Employment Strategy:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to sections 1055 and 1056, which impinge on the President\u2019s \nauthority to implement the New START Treaty and to set U.S. nuclear weapons policy.  In \nparticular, section 1055 would set onerous conditions on the Administration\u2019s ability to \nimplement the Treaty, as well as to retire, dismantle, or eliminate non-deployed nuclear \nweapons.  Among these conditions is the completion and operation of the next generation of \nnuclear facilities, which is not expected until the mid-2020s.  The effect of this section would be \nto preclude dismantlement of weapons in excess of military needs.  Additionally, it would \nsignificantly increase stewardship and management costs and divert key resources from our \ncritical stockpile sustainment efforts and delay completion of programs necessary to support the \nlong-term safety, security, and reliability of our nuclear deterrent.  Further, section 1056 raises \nconstitutional concerns as it appears to encroach on the President\u2019s authority as Commander in \nChief to set nuclear employment policy \u2013 a right exercised by every president in the nuclear age \nfrom both parties.  If the final bill presented to the President includes these provisions, the \nPresident's senior advisors would recommend a veto. \n \nDetainee Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1034 which, in purporting to \naffirm the conflict, would effectively recharacterize its scope and would risk creating confusion \nregarding applicable standards.  At a minimum, this is an issue that merits more extensive \nconsideration before possible inclusion.  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions \nthat limit the use of authorized funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee \ntransfers and to the provisions that would legislate Executive branch processes for periodic \nreview of detainee status and regarding prosecution of detainees.  Although the Administration \nopposes the release of detainees within the United States, Section 1039 is a dangerous and \nunprecedented challenge to critical Executive branch authority to determine when and where to \nprosecute detainees, based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national \nsecurity interests.  It unnecessarily constrains our Nation's counterterrorism efforts and would \nundermine our national security, particularly where our Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the \nonly \u2013 option for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political \nparties \u2013 including Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. \nBush \u2013 have leveraged the flexibility and strength of our Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous \nterrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an \nessential element of our counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available \noption.  The certification requirement in section 1040, restricting transfers to foreign countries, \ninterferes with the authority of the Executive branch to make important foreign policy and \nnational security determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers \nshould occur.  The Administration must have the ability to act swiftly and to have broad \nflexibility in conducting its negotiations with foreign countries.  Section 1036 undermines the \nsystem of periodic review established by the President\u2019s March 7, 2011, Executive Order by \nsubstituting a rigid system of review that could limit the advice and expertise of critical \nintelligence and law enforcement professionals, undermining the Executive branch\u2019s ability to \nensure that these decisions are informed by all available information and protect the full \nspectrum of our national security interests.  It also unnecessarily interferes with DoD\u2019s ability to \n2  manage detention operations.  Section 1042 is problematic and unnecessary, as there already is \nrobust coordination between the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the \nIntelligence Community on terrorism-related cases, and this provision would undermine, rather \nthan enhance, this coordination by requiring institutions to assume unfamiliar roles and could \ncause delays in taking into custody individuals who pose imminent threats to the nation\u2019s safety.  \nIf the final bill presented to the President includes these provisions that challenge critical \nExecutive branch authority, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend a veto. \n \nAttempts to Prevent, Delay, or Undermine the Repeal of \"Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\":  On December \n22, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, in \norder to strengthen our national security, enhance military readiness, and uphold the fundamental \nAmerican principles of fairness and equality that warfighters defend around the world.  As \nrequired by that statute, DoD is diligently working to prepare the necessary policies and \nregulations and conducting educational briefings to implement the repeal.  Should it be \ndetermined, as required by the statute, that the implementation is consistent with the standards of \nmilitary readiness and effectiveness, unit cohesion, and military recruiting and retention, then the \nPresident, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will send \nforward the required certification.  The Administration strongly objects to any legislative \nattempts (such as section 533) to directly or indirectly undermine, prevent, or delay the \nimplementation of the repeal, as such efforts create uncertainty for servicemembers and their \nfamilies.   \n \nMilitary Regulations Regarding Marriage:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 534 \nand 535, believes that section 3 of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is \ndiscriminatory, and supports DOMA\u2019s repeal.   \n \nLimitation on Funds to Provide Russian Federation with Access to U.S. Missile Defense \nTechnology and International Agreements Relating to Missile Defense:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to the following two sections: (1) section 1228 would prohibit the provision to \nthe Russian Federation of a range of missile defense data, when the appropriate reciprocal \nexchange of such data may improve the ability of the United States and NATO to provide \neffective missile defenses of our military forces and other citizens; and (2) section 1229 would \nunnecessarily impede the Administration's ability to conduct discussions with the Russian \nFederation on missile defense matters both bilaterally and in the NATO context, and would be \nimpractical to implement, for example by requiring that the Administration report on all \n\"suggestions\" made by representatives of the Russian Federation in government to government \ncontacts (which could include the legislative branch).  Among other things, section 1229 raises \nconstitutional concerns, as it appears to encroach on the President\u2019s exclusive authority to \ndetermine the time, scope, and objectives of international negotiations and to maintain the \nconfidentiality of sensitive diplomatic discussions. \n \nExtended Deterrent in Europe:  The Administration strongly objects, including on constitutional \ngrounds, to the elements of section 1230 that would limit the President\u2019s ability to determine \nmilitary requirements in Europe, conduct diplomacy, and negotiate treaties.  The Administration \nalso objects to this section\u2019s limitation on Administration efforts to address tactical nuclear \nweapons, a step called for in the Senate\u2019s Resolution of Ratification of the New START Treaty \nand a priority of U.S. arms control policy.  Further, the Administration notes this section would \ninhibit our ability to function within NATO.  \n \n3  Limitation on Force Management Efficiencies:  The Administration strongly objects to \nprovisions such as sections 1094, 2307, 2705, and 2862 that would limit the Secretary\u2019s \ndiscretion in determining and executing force management efficiencies.  For example, section \n1094 would require the Secretary of the Navy to maintain a minimum force of 10 aircraft carrier \nair-wings and a dedicated headquarters for each.  However, a reduction from 10 to 9 aircraft \ncarrier air wings staff is projected to save DoD approximately $22.2 million over five years (FYs \n2012-2016) and meets the needs of the Navy which has no operational need for a 10th carrier air \nwing.  Additionally, sections 2307, 2705, and 2862, requiring additional study and notice of \nproposed disestablishment, closure or realignment of certain military installations, or the \nreduction in the number of military personnel and waiting times prior to execution, impedes the \nSecretary\u2019s ability to make and implement force management decisions that would ensure scarce \nresources are directed to the highest priorities for the warfighter.     \n \nUnified Medical Command:  The Administration strongly objects to section 711, which would \nrequire the President to create a new unified combatant command for medical operations.  DoD \nwill shortly complete a study on how to best deliver high-quality medical care to servicemembers \nand their families in an effective and cost-efficient manner.  Among the options this study will \nconsider is a joint medical command similar to this provision; however, this section presumes the \noutcome of the study and of decisions to be made by DoD leadership on this important subject.   \n \nDesignation of Main Propulsion System of the Next-Generation Long Range Strike Bomber \nAircraft as Major Subprogram:  The Administration objects to language in section 220, which \nwould require the Secretary of Defense to designate the main propulsion system of the next-\ngeneration long-range strike bomber as a major subprogram and require a competitive \nacquisition strategy.  A major tenet of the new bomber program is to maximize the use of \nexisting engine systems.  The approach needs to rely on minor modifications to existing engines \nand give the prime contractors freedom to select the engine that is right for their design.  \nMoreover, the prime contractor\u2019s design concepts may differ so widely that it would be \nimpractical to have a separate engine competition and then insert the winning engine into the \nwinning airframe.  Mandating such development would likely result in increased cost and risk.  \nAlso, this provision would require the designation of a major subprogram on a program that has \nnot yet been designated as a major defense acquisition program. \n \nMission Force Enhancement Transfer Fund:  The Administration objects to sections 1433 and \n4501, which authorize the transfer of $1 billion through the \"Mission Force Enhancement \nTransfer Fund\" to support efforts not requested in the FY 2012 Budget.   \n \nDiversion of Funding:  Over a hundred provisions of the bill (sections 1601-1699M) direct that \nthe relevant Secretary \"shall obligate\" specified funding in particular ways.  The Administration \nis concerned that these provisions could preclude the use of DoD funds for higher priority \nmilitary needs.  The Administration requires more time to review these provisions and assess \ntheir impact on DoD. \n \nPATRIOT/MEADS Combined Aggregate Program (CAP):  The Administration appreciates the \nsupport for DoD's air and missile defense programs; however, it objects to the $149.5 million \nauthorization reduction in the PATRIOT/MEADS Combined Aggregate Program. This reduction \ncould trigger a unilateral withdrawal from the MEADS Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) \nwith Germany and Italy, which could further lead to a DoD obligation to pay all contract costs\u2014\na scenario that would likely exceed the cost of satisfying its commitment under the MOU.  This \n4  reduction also could call into question DoD's ability to honor its financial commitments in other \nbinding cooperative MOUs, leading to negative consequences for other current and future \ninternational cooperative programs. \n  \nAdvance Appropriations:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s stated support for the \nAdministration\u2019s new strategy for reforming space acquisition.  However, the Administration is \ndisappointed that no requested advance appropriations are authorized.  Section 132 would only \nauthorize the Secretary of the Air Force to procure two Advanced Extremely High Frequency \n(AEHF) satellites through incremental funding.  Further, H.R. 1540 authorizes only a small \nportion of the total remaining cost of $4.1 billion requested in regular and advance \nappropriations to enable full-funding of procurement of AEHF satellites and certain classified \nprograms.  Providing the full procurement costs in advance appropriations before proceeding \nwith the acquisition is central to the Administration\u2019s new acquisition strategy and cost discipline \napproach. \n \nShip and Military Construction Incremental Funding:  The Administration objects to the \nincremental funding in section 121, which would authorize an additional year of incremental \nfunding for the LHA-7 amphibious assault ship.  Large-deck amphibious ships are already \nfunded over two years, and any additional incremental funding period runs counter to sound \nbudgeting principles and fiscal discipline.  Section 4601 would incrementally fund military \nconstruction projects, which raises the same concerns and increases the costs of the projects.   \n \nMilitary Activities in Cyberspace:  The Administration agrees that appropriate military \noperations in cyberspace are a vital component of national security, but objects to Section 962.  \nThe Administration has concerns about this provision and wants to work with Congress to ensure \nthat any such legislation adds clarity and value to our efforts in cyberspace. \n \nDiversion of Pension Funding:  The Administration strongly objects to the restriction in section \n3113 of Executive branch authority to manage obligations for contractor pension obligations.  In \nthe FY 2012 Budget, the Administration added substantial funds to ensure that defined-benefit \npension plans of Department of Energy contractors are financially viable.  This legislation \ncircumvents efforts by the Administration to implement long-term solutions for pension funding \nshortfalls. \n \nAbrams/Bradley Upgrades:  The Administration objects to $425 million of unrequested \nauthorization in section 4101, line 007 and 014 for upgrades to M-1 Abrams tanks and M-2 \nBradley Fighting Vehicles for unneeded upgrades in a fiscally-constrained environment.   \n \nAmphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV):  Section 214 would restrict the ability to develop \nimprovements to existing AAVs until the completion of an analysis of AAV requirements and \nthe completion of an analysis of alternatives of various options to fill such requirements.  The \nMarine Corps is committed to a follow-on for the AAV; however, this provision would limit the \nability to both improve the existing fleet and inhibit analysis of the best replacement options. \n \nTroops to Teachers Program:  The Administration urges the House\u2019s support for the transfer of \nthe Troops to Teachers Program to DoD in FY 2012, as reflected in the President\u2019s Budget and \nDoD\u2019s legislative proposal to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and \nTitle 10 of the U.S. Code.  The move to Defense will help ensure that this important program \nsupporting members of the military as teachers is retained and provide better oversight of \n5  program outcomes by simplifying and streamlining program management.  The Administration \nlooks forward to keeping the Congress abreast of this transfer, to ensure it runs smoothly and has \nno adverse impact on program enrollees. \n \nA number of the bill\u2019s provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, including \nencroachment on the President\u2019s exclusive authorities related to international negotiations.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns.           \n                    \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n6  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMarch 26, 2012 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3309 \u2013 Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2012 \n(Rep. Walden, R-Oregon, and 9 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3309, because it would limit the ability of \nthe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to exercise its statutory duty to protect the \npublic interest in its review of transactions affecting the vital communications industry.   \n \nH.R. 3309 would, in effect, create a separate Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for the \nFCC.  For more than 60 years, the APA has provided a uniform framework to guide decision \nmaking by all Federal administrative agencies.  That Act, supplemented by a rich body of court \nprecedent, creates the framework for public, reasoned agency actions and provides certainty for \nregulators and the public.  It is generally recognized that, in recent years, the FCC has improved \nits practices and procedures to make it more effective. \n \nH.R. 3309 would also limit the FCC\u2019s ability to impose conditions, or to accept commitments \nfrom transacting parties, as part of its review of transfers of licenses and other assets.  These \nrestrictions would harm the Federal Government\u2019s ability to promote the most effective \ncompetitive outcome in any given transaction involving communications firms.   H.R. 3309 \nwould limit the ability of the FCC and the Justice Department to work together on \ntelecommunications matters to protect consumers, promote competition, and increase innovation \nto ensure access to more choices, lower rates and prices, and better products. \n \nAs evidenced by Executive Orders 13563 and 13579, the Administration is committed to \nensuring that the decisions of all Federal agencies are open, transparent, well-founded, and \nprotective of the public interest.  H.R. 3309 does not further those goals.    \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                            \n    February 6, 2011 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3521 \u2013 The Expedited Legislative Line-Item Veto and Rescissions Act \n(Rep.

The legislation creates an \nexpedited procedure that guarantees an up-or-down vote on certain rescissions proposed by the \nPresident, helping to eliminate unnecessary spending and discouraging waste.  Since taking office, a \npriority of the Administration has been identifying and cutting unnecessary spending and \nredirecting low-priority spending to more productive uses.  This Administration has repeatedly \nasked the Congress to authorize new tools to eliminate unnecessary spending and discourage waste \nin the first place. \n  \nOn May 24, 2010, the President sent to the Congress the Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of \n2010 providing for expedited rescission authority.  H.R. 3521 is similar in many ways to the \nPresident's proposal; however, it is not identical.  It would allow the President, within 45 days of \nenactment of a bill or joint resolution, to transmit a special message to the Congress proposing to \ncancel any discretionary funding provided in the legislation.  Legislation implementing the \nproposed cancellations would receive expedited consideration in both the House of Representatives \nand the Senate, and the bill implementing the rescissions would not be subject to amendment.  To \nprotect the Congress' equities, the President could not repeatedly submit rescissions of the same \nprovisions, and any temporary withholdings of funds would have to be released after the period of \ntime for congressional consideration has passed. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on passage of expedited \nrescission authority as requested by the President. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  June 1, 2011 \n  (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2055 \u2014 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2012 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2055, making appropriations for military \nconstruction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2012, and for other purposes.  The Administration is committed to ensuring the \nNation lives within its means and reducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the \nglobal economy and win the future.  That is why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal \nframework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, supports economic growth and long-term job \ncreation, protects critical investments, and meets the commitments made to provide dignity and \nsecurity to Americans no matter their circumstances.   \n \nWhile overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of \nongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional \nleadership on the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, a number of problematic policy and language \nissues have been included in the bill as follows:  \n \nMilitary Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for critical \nMilitary Construction projects but is concerned with the use of incremental funding that would \nnot support usable segments for the following projects:  Aviation Complex, Fort Wainwright, \nAlaska; Mountainview Operations Center, Buckley Air Force Base, Colorado; Ambulatory Care \nCenter, Joint Base Andrews, Maryland; and Guam Strike Fuel Systems Maintenance Hangar, \nJoint Region Marianas, Guam.  Incremental funding of Military Construction runs counter to \nsound budgeting principles and fiscal discipline. \n \nImplementation of Force Management Initiatives.  The Administration is concerned with the \ninclusion of two provisions that limit the ability of the Department of Defense to undertake force \nmanagement actions, including previously approved Base Realignment and Closure actions.  The \nauthority to execute these force management actions allows the Department to more efficiently \nallocate scarce resources during a time of conflict. \n \nConstitutional Concerns.  Section 113 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require \nthe Executive Branch, without discretion, to notify the Congress 30 days in advance of certain \nmilitary exercises, which would intrude on the President's discharge of his Constitutional \nauthorities and duties to protect national security.  The Administration recommends revising \nsection 113 to make explicit that 30 days advance notice to the Congress is required where \nfeasible and consistent with the President's constitutional responsibilities to protect national \nsecurity. \n \nProject Labor Agreements.  The Administration strongly opposes the provision prohibiting the \nenforcement of Executive Order 13502 (and implementing issuances) on the use of project labor  agreements.  The use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) can provide structure and stability to \nlarge construction projects.  PLAs also help ensure compliance with laws and regulations \ngoverning workplace safety and health, equal employment opportunity and labor and \nemployment standards. The coordination achieved through PLAs can significantly enhance the \neconomy and efficiency of Federal construction projects. \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are \nbeyond the scope of funding legislation.  Should the Congress continue to include language that \nis not relevant to a funding debate, the Administration will oppose the bill.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations process moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nOctober 20, 2011 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 1726 \u2013 Withholding Tax Relief Act of 2011 \n(Sen. McConnell, R\u2013Kentucky) \n \nThe Administration supports the intent of S. 1726 to repeal a three percent withholding on \ncertain payments made to private contractors by Federal, State, and local government entities, \nbut strongly objects to the bill\u2019s rescission of appropriated discretionary funds to pay for the \nrepeal.  The repeal of the withholding requirement in S. 1726 would reduce a burden on \ngovernment contractors, who otherwise comply with their tax obligations, particularly small \nbusinesses.  As most recently evidenced in the President\u2019s proposed American Jobs Act, released \nSeptember 12, 2011, the Administration has supported alleviating this burden, which was \noriginally enacted into law on May 17, 2006.  The Administration also believes it is important to \nensure that Federal contractors are compliant with tax laws and support more targeted efforts that \nprevent persons with outstanding tax debts from receiving Federal contracts.  The effect of the \nrepeal of the withholding requirement would be to avoid a decrease in cashflow to these \ncontractors, which would allow them to retain these funds and use them to create jobs and pay \nsuppliers.  This would complement the Administration\u2019s other efforts to help small businesses.  \nAs well, this provision would reduce implementation costs borne by Federal and other \ngovernmental agencies.   \n \nHowever, the rescission of $30 billion of appropriated funds runs counter to the spirit of two \nrecent bipartisan agreements, including the recently-enacted Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  \nThat Act has instituted spending caps that will cut annual Government spending by about $1 \ntrillion over the next ten years and, by the end of the decade, will bring discretionary spending to \nits lowest level as a share of the economy since the Eisenhower Administration.  Disregarding \nthe BCA agreement and cutting already-tight discretionary program levels even further, as this \nbill would do, would be a serious mistake.  The bill\u2019s unspecified rescission of $30 billion in \nappropriated funds would cause serious disruption in a range of services supported by the \nFederal Government.  To further address the need to reduce the Federal deficit, the President has \noffered a detailed blueprint for more than $3 trillion in additional deficit reduction.  The \nAdministration is committed to working with the Congress on a balanced approach to deficit \nreduction and is willing to work with the Senate to identify acceptable offsets for the budgetary \ncosts associated with the repeal in S. 1726, including but not limited to ones that are in the \nPresident\u2019s detailed blueprint.  If S. 1726 is presented to the President with the current offset, his \nsenior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.         \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  March 1, 2011 \n  (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4 \u2013 Comprehensive 1099 Taxpayer Protection and  \nRepayment of Exchange Subsidy Overpayments Act of 2011 \n(Rep. Lungren, R-California, and 273 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports efforts to repeal the provision in the Affordable Care Act \nthat established information reporting requirements for tax purposes that place an unnecessary \nbookkeeping burden on small businesses.  The Administration is committed to reducing the gap \nbetween taxes legally owed and taxes paid, but believes that the burden created on businesses by \nthe new information reporting requirement on purchases of goods that exceed $600, as included \nin Section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code as modified by Section 9006 of the Affordable \nCare Act, is too great. \n \nHowever, the Administration has serious concerns about the approach the Congress has taken to \npaying for the repeal.  The Administration strongly opposes the House\u2019s offset to pay for this \nrepeal in H.R. 4, which would undo an improvement enacted with nearly unanimous support in \nthe Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act that eliminated an egregious \u201ccliff\u201d in the tax system \naffecting middle income taxpayers.  Specifically, H.R. 4 would result in tax increases on certain \nmiddle-class families that incur unexpected tax liabilities, in many cases totaling thousands of \ndollars, notwithstanding that they followed the rules.  The Administration also notes that a \nprovision repealing the same information reporting requirements in the FAA Air Transportation \nModernization and Safety Improvement Act would pay for the repeal with an unspecified \nrescission of $44 billion that, in combination with other proposals currently under consideration \nin Congress, could cause serious disruption in a wide range of services provided by the Federal \ngovernment. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on the repeal of the \ninformation reporting requirements in the course of the legislative process, including finding an \nacceptable offset for the cost of the repeal.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n                         April 17, 2012 \n     (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 9 \u2013 Small Business Tax Cut Act  \n (Rep. Cantor, R-VA, and 42 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 9.  The President believes that small \nbusiness tax relief can promote hiring workers and increasing investment here at home.  H.R. 9, \nhowever, is not focused on cutting taxes for small businesses, but instead would provide tax cuts to the \nmost fortunate.  Under the bill\u2019s definition of income, many of the \u201csmall businesses\u201d that would \nreceive the largest tax breaks are law partners, consultants, and other wealthy individuals and \ncorporations with the biggest profits.  The proposal is a giveaway that will cost $46 billion and could, \nin fact, lead to delays and reductions in investment and hiring. \n \nWhile H.R. 9 has been described as a way to help small businesses, independent non-partisan analyses \nconfirm that 49 percent of the bill\u2019s benefits would go to taxpayers making more than $1 million per \nyear.  Individuals in higher tax brackets would be able to take the bill\u2019s deduction against higher tax \nrates, making it more valuable for higher earners and more profitable firms.  For the one percent of \nindividuals with small business income in the top tax bracket and for profitable corporations, the \ndeduction is worth more than double what it is worth to the two-thirds of small business owners in the \n15 percent bracket or lower.  Moreover, because \u201csmall business\u201d is broadly defined and the tax relief \nis conditioned only on the size of payroll, many very large and highly profitable firms will be eligible \nfor the tax break.  The Administration believes that this bill is not an effective way to incentivize small \nbusiness investment and job creation. \n \nFurthermore, under H.R. 9, small businesses that invested or hired more this year would, in many \ninstances, get a smaller tax cut than those that did not, because the bill would have the deduction taken \nagainst the amount of a company\u2019s net income from which wages for new workers or long-term \ninvestments in equipment are actually subtracted.  With the deduction only available for one year, it is \nlikely that some firms would reduce or delay new hiring or new investment as a result.  The bill also \nopens up avenues for potential abuse, allowing a deduction for payments to family members who have \nbeen \u201chired\u201d for the year as well as creating an incentive for firms to try to re-characterize current \nactivities to earn the deduction.   \n \nCongress should act to help American small businesses hire and grow with targeted tax relief designed \nto boost jobs, rather than tax cuts for the most fortunate that actually discourage investment.  In both \nhis Budget and his business tax reform framework, the President put forward an ambitious plan to \nsimplify small business tax returns and provide tax relief \u2014 including targeted employer tax relief that \nconditions its benefit on actual new hiring, directly encouraging job growth.  Those proposals build on \nthe 17 small business tax cuts that the President has already signed into law, ranging from the small \nbusiness health tax credit to more generous depreciation.  The Administration believes that this \nlegislation fails to accomplish these goals.  If the President is presented with H.R. 9, his senior advisors \nwould recommend that he veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n \nNovember 29, 2012 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n  \n  S. 3254 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013 \n  (Sen. Levin, D-MI) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee's continued support for our \nnational defense and supports a large number of the provisions in S. 3254, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for FY 2013, such as its support for both the base budget and for overseas \ncontingency operations; the Administration's initiative to modernize the military retirement system; \nand authorities that enhance the Department of Defense's (DOD's) ability to operate in \nunconventional and irregular warfare, counter unconventional threats, or support contingency or \nstability operations.  However, while there are numerous areas of agreement with the Committee, \nthe Administration has serious concerns with provisions that: (1) depart from the President's FY \n2013 Budget request; (2) constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions \nconsistent with the new defense strategy; and (3) limit key authorities of the Executive.  If the bill is \npresented to the President for approval in its current form, the President's senior advisers would \nrecommend that the President veto the bill.  The Administration strongly supports the overall goals \nof this legislation and looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below, and eventually signing this \nimportant legislation.  \n \nDetainee Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1031's restrictions on the use of \nfunds to transfer detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to foreign countries.  \nWhen he signed past versions of this legislation, the President objected to the restrictions carried \nforward by section 1031, promised to work towards their repeal, and warned the Congress that the \nrestrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay to foreign countries would in certain \ncircumstances interfere with constitutional responsibilities committed to the Executive Branch.  \nSince these restrictions have been on the books, they have limited the Executive's ability to manage \nmilitary operations in an ongoing armed conflict, harmed the country's diplomatic relations with \nallies and counterterrorism partners, and provided no benefit whatsoever to our national security.  \nThe Administration continues to believe that restricting the transfer of detainees to the custody of \nforeign countries in the context of an ongoing armed conflict interferes with the Executive's ability \nto make important foreign policy and national security determinations, and would in certain \ncircumstances violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  The Administration also \ncontinues to oppose the prohibition on funding to construct, acquire or modify a detention facility in \nthe United States to house any individual detained at Guantanamo, which shortsightedly constrains \nthe options available to military and counterterrorism professionals to address evolving threats.  The \nrestrictions carried forward by section 1031 were misguided when they were enacted and should not \nbe renewed.   \n \nTRICARE Fees and Co-Payments:  The Administration strongly encourages the Senate to adopt its \nrequested TRICARE fee initiatives that seek to control the spiraling DOD health care costs while \nkeeping retired beneficiaries' share of these costs well below the levels experienced when the  TRICARE program was implemented in the mid-1990s.  The projected TRICARE savings of $1.8 \nbillion in FY 2013 and $12.9 billion through FY 2017 are essential for DOD to successfully address \nrising personnel costs.  DOD needs these savings to balance and maintain investments for key \ndefense priorities.   \n \nStructure of the Air Force:  The Administration strongly objects to Title XVII, which would place \nlimitations on funding to be used to divest, retire, or transfer units of the Air National Guard or Air \nForce Reserve, in addition to creating a commission to study the appropriate makeup of the Air \nForce.  These provisions would force DOD to operate, sustain, and maintain aircraft that are in \nexcess to national security requirements, as defined by the new defense strategy, and are not \naffordable in an austere budget environment. They also would impair the ability of the Secretary to \nmanage the Department and, by retaining large numbers of under-resourced aircraft in the fleet in \ntoday's fiscally constrained environment, could contribute to a hollow force. \n \nReductions in Civilian and Contractor Workforce:  The Administration objects to section 341, \nwhich would reduce funding for the civilian and contractor workforce by a rate that is at least equal \nto the percentage of funding saved from the planned reductions in military personnel end strength.  \nThis would require savings in the civilian and service contractor workforces in excess of $5 billion \nover planned savings through FY 2017.  The Administration believes the size of the civilian \nworkforce should be determined based on workload and funding, not on arbitrary comparisons to \nthe military.  To comply with this legislation, the Department would need to significantly divest \nworkload and impose workforce caps. \n \nAlternative Fuels:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 313 and 2823, which would limit \nDOD's ability to procure alternative fuels for military applications.  Section 313 is overly broad and \nhas the potential to restrict investments by making price the sole factor in determining if DOD could \nuse an alternative fuel, without any consideration of military capability, mission, or circumstances \ncontributing to long-term energy security.  Section 2823 would limit DOD's ability to contribute to \nthe development of a domestic capability to produce cost-competitive advanced drop-in biofuels at \na commercial scale.  Such a capability, pursued in collaboration with the Departments of \nAgriculture and Energy, would help insulate the Nation, as well as the military, against potential \nsupply disruptions.  \n \nMedium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS):  The Administration strongly objects to section \n236, which would prohibit the use of funds for the MEADS program.  If the Congress does not \nappropriate FY 2013 funding, there is a high likelihood that this action would be perceived by our \npartners, Italy and Germany, as breaking our commitment under the Memorandum of \nUnderstanding.  This could harm our relationship with our allies on a much broader basis, including \nfuture multinational cooperative projects.  It also could prevent the completion of the agreed Proof \nof Concept activities, which would provide data archiving, analysis of testing, and software \ndevelopment necessary to harvest technology from U.S. and partner investments in MEADS. \n \nMissile Defense:  The Administration appreciates the support for DOD's air and missile defense \nprograms as well as support for the Government of Israel's Iron Dome rocket system. \n \nReplacement Project for Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 3111, which would require construction of the Chemistry and Metallurgy \nResearch Replacement (CMRR) facility to begin in 2013.  The Departments of Defense and Energy \nagree that, in light of today's fiscal environment, CMRR can be deferred for at least five years, and \n2  funds reallocated to support higher priority nuclear weapons goals.  An interim strategy will be \nimplemented to provide adequate support to plutonium pit manufacturing and storage needs until a \nlong-term solution can be implemented.  Further, S. 3254 would require funding for the CMRR in \nFY 2013 to be taken from other National Nuclear Security Administration priorities, creating undue \nrisks for other parts of the program, including delays to critical infrastructure modernization, \nunderfunding operations of the nuclear complex, and curtailing science, engineering, and key \nnonproliferation initiatives.  Finally, section 3111 specifies an operational date but caps total \nfunding at the low end of the agency estimate, which may not be achievable.  \n \nLimitation on Reimbursement of the Government of Pakistan:  The Administration strongly objects \nto the certification requirements in section 1216.  These certification requirements \u2013 some of which \nrequire the Secretary of Defense to certify Pakistani cooperation on issues outside of his purview \u2013 \nare proposed at a particularly sensitive time and would severely constrict DOD's ability to respond \nto emergent war-time coalition support requirements, putting at risk the success of our campaign in \nAfghanistan.  \n \nCybersecurity:  The Administration objects to sections 925 and 929.  The provisions significantly \nlimit the Administration's flexibility by specifying technical choices that do not allow the National \nSecurity Agency to most effectively execute its mission and take advantage of the economic and \ntechnological advantages of cloud and next generation technologies.  In particular, section 929 \nwould, in effect, deny the use of an open source project for DOD and establish a dangerous \nprecedent for the use of open source in general. \n \nUnrequested Authorizations:  The Administration objects to the unrequested authorizations for the \nadvance procurement of additional F/A-18E/F Navy fighter aircraft and for unneeded upgrades to \nthe M-1 Abrams tank.  Funding these items in this fiscally-constrained environment would divert \nscarce resources away from more important defense programs. \n \nOffice of Security Cooperation in Iraq (OSC-I):  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \nfull funding for the OSC-I.  However, section 1212 does not include the Administration's requested \nlanguage that authorizes the OSC-I to conduct critical training and assisting activities for Iraqi \nMinistry of Defense and Counter-terrorism Service (CTS) personnel.  This authority is needed to \ncontinue supporting the Government of Iraq's efforts to address Iraqi Ministry of Defense and CTS \ncapability gaps, which was authorized through the Iraqi Security Forces Fund. \n \nRequirements and Limitations for Suspensions and Debarment Officials:  The Administration \nobjects to section 881, which would impose an identical organizational structure and set of duties \nfor each of the suspension and debarment programs operated by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and \nDefense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The proposed restrictions would unnecessarily force DOD to \nmake disruptive and costly changes to its existing programs \u2013 especially at the Army and DLA \u2013that \nalready are among the most active and effective in the Federal government in protecting taxpayers \nfrom fraud, waste, and abuse.  DOD should be allowed to retain the discretion to appropriately tailor \nits suspension and debarment programs so that they may operate in the most efficient and effective \nmanner possible. \n \nMilitary Construction Funding for Guam:  The Administration strongly objects to the limitations \nimposed by section 2208 on the obligation and expenditure of United States and Government of \nJapan funds to implement the realignment of the U.S. Marine Corps units from Okinawa, to which \nthe United States remains steadfastly committed.  The provision would unnecessarily restrict the \n3  ability and flexibility of the President to execute our foreign and defense policies with our ally, \nJapan.  In April 2012, the United States and Japan announced a new plan to implement the \nrealignment of U.S. forces from Okinawa to Guam.  Prohibiting the use of funds could adversely \nimpact the United States' ability to move forward on the new plan.  Additionally and separate from \nthe section 2208 restrictions, the Administration has serious concerns over the lack of authorization \nof appropriations for essential upgrades to the fuel pipeline from Apra Harbor to Andersen AB, \ntheater-wide strategic capability.  The reduction of $233 million would impede the implementation \nof our new defense strategy, which calls for an increased focus on the Asia-Pacific region.   \n \nElectro-Optical Imagery:  The Administration objects to section 930, which would require the \nAdministration to sustain the commercial imagery program through FY 2013 at a funding level that \nis significantly above the President's request.  The plan reflected in the President's Budget results in \nan approximately 50 percent cost reduction while keeping about 75 percent of the planned capacity \ngrowth.  This option represents the best value for the government. \n \nIncremental Funding:  The Administration strongly objects to the use of incremental funding for the \nSpace-Based Infrared System satellites and the VIRGINIA class attack submarine because \nincremental funding undermines program stability and cost discipline.  Although the Administration \nsupports the underlying programs, the requested full funding and advance appropriations is \npreferred. \n \nMilitary Personnel:  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of the requested 1.7 percent \nmilitary pay raise and the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission.   \nHowever, congressional support for the Administration's force management proposals is also \ncritical.  Maintaining readiness, while responsibly reducing our force structure, will be a major \nchallenge in the years ahead.  Enacting the force management proposals, which will provide a key \ntool in achieving the necessary force drawdown, will give DOD flexibility to create a more agile \nforce, ensure DOD retains the right skills, and preserves the morale of the all-volunteer force.  \n \nNational Language Service Corps:  The Administration has concerns with section 941 and looks \nforward to working with the Congress to address those concerns. \n \nMilitary Access to Reproductive Care and Health:  The Administration supports section 711, which \nwould include the rape and incest exception to the general prohibition on using appropriated funds \nto perform abortions under section 1093(a) of Title 10.  The inclusion would make this provision \nconsistent with other major abortion funding restrictions in Federal law.  In addition, the \nAdministration supports the restoration of policy to ensure that servicewomen and military \ndependents \u2013 including servicewomen stationed overseas \u2013 have the ability to obtain abortion \nservices using their own, private funds.  \n \nA number of the bill's provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, including separation of \npowers.  The Administration also looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and \nother concerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n4  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n  June 25, 2012 \n \n(Senate)\nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 1940 \u2013 Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act of 2011 \n(Sen.

By requiring the Federal Emergency Management Agency to move \nto full risk-based premium rates for certain properties, the bill would strengthen the NFIP's \nfinancial position and increase its ability to fund future claims.  The bill would also reduce flood \nrisk and increase the resiliency of communities to flooding.  \nThe Administration is pleased that the bill supports transitioning to actuarially sound rates to \nenable policyholders and communities to adjust to risk-based premiums.  In addition, the \nAdministration supports the bill's measures to strengthen and streamline mitigation programs. \nAs the bill moves through the legislative process, the Administration looks forward to working \nwith the Congress on additional reforms to strengthen the NFIP and help economically distressed \nhomeowners in a manner that is consistent with the President's Budget.  \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n \n  December 1, 2011 \n  (Senate) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nS. 1931 \u2013 Temporary Tax Holiday and Government Reduction Act \n(Sen. Heller, R-Nevada) \n \nIn the American Jobs Act, the President proposed to continue and expand the payroll tax cut in \nplace this year to help provide relief to working families and boost the economy and proposed a \npayroll tax cut for America's small businesses to help them grow.  Passage of S. 1917, the \nMiddle Class Tax Cut Act of 2011, would enact these tax cuts into law and fully pay for them by \nasking the Nation's wealthiest to contribute a small percentage more.  \n \nThe Administration recognizes that S. 1931 would at least continue this year's payroll tax cut.  \nHowever, the Administration opposes S. 1931 because, by contrast to S. 1917, it provides one-\nthird less tax relief for America's workers, does not help America's small businesses, and is paid \nfor by unbalanced cuts that would break a bipartisan deal achieved in August and would \nundermine the Nation's ability to invest in areas that are key to America's future, to maintain core \ngovernment functions, and to defend the United States.     \n \nIf the Congress does nothing, the typical working family earning $50,000 will see its taxes go up \nby $1,000.  Under the American Jobs Act and S. 1917, that family's tax cut would be increased \nfrom $1,000 to over $1,500.  By contrast, S. 1931 does not expand the current payroll tax cut at \nall, thus providing one-third less tax relief to 160 million American workers.  In addition, S. \n1917 offers relief to America's small businesses by cutting their payroll taxes in half and offering \nthem a complete holiday for adding new payroll.  S. 1931 offers none of this relief.   \n \nWhile S. 1917 proposes to fully pay for the tax cuts in a balanced and fair way by asking those \nearning over a million dollars a year to pay their fair share, S. 1931 would almost entirely pay for \nthe payroll tax cuts by breaking the bipartisan deal achieved in the Budget Control Act.  It would \nadd new cuts on top of the $1 trillion in reductions to defense and non-defense spending under \nthe Budget Control Act and the additional $1.2 trillion in cuts that could automatically go into \nplace because of the failure of the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction.  The additional \nspending cuts under S. 1931 would mean further reductions in areas like education and energy, \nreducing core government functions ranging from services for this Nation's veterans to border \nsecurity, and further cutting back spending on the Nation's defense.  \n \nThe President is committed to providing tax relief to America's workers and small businesses \nnext year and fully paying for this relief in a way that is fair.  The Administration strongly \nsupports S. 1917 and opposes S. 1931. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n \nDecember 13, 2011 \n(House) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nH.R. 3630 \u2013 Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2011 \n(Rep.

With only days left before taxes go up for 160 \nmillion hardworking Americans, H.R. 3630 plays politics at the expense of middle-class \nfamilies.  H.R. 3630 breaks the bipartisan agreement on spending cuts that was reached just a \nfew months ago and would inevitably lead to pressure to cut investments in areas like education \nand clean energy.  Furthermore, H.R. 3630 seeks to put the burden of paying for the bill on \nworking families, while giving a free pass to the wealthiest and to big corporations by protecting \ntheir loopholes and subsidies. \n \nInstead of working together to find a balanced approach that will actually pass both Houses of \nthe Congress, H.R. 3630 instead represents a choice to refight old political battles over health \ncare and introduce ideological issues into what should be a simple debate about cutting taxes for \nthe middle class.  \n \nThis debate should not be about scoring political points.

This proposal, which would enable \ngreater flexibility in soliciting relatively small equity investments, grew out of the President\u2019s \nStartup America initiative and has been endorsed by the President\u2019s Council on Jobs and \nCompetitiveness.  H.R. 2930 is broadly consistent with the President\u2019s proposal.  This bill will \nmake it easier for entrepreneurs to raise capital and create jobs.

Pitts, R-PA, and 3 cosponsors) \n \nThe Affordable Care Act made significant improvements to our Nation\u2019s health care system that \nare helping to improve individuals' health and give American families and small business owners \nmore control of their own health care.  These important changes include: ending the worst \npractices of insurance companies; giving uninsured individuals and small business owners the \nsame kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress have; and bringing \ndown the cost of health care for families and businesses while also reducing Federal budget \ndeficits.  \n \nThe Affordable Care Act also created the Prevention and Public Health Fund to assist State and \ncommunity efforts to prevent illness and promote health, so that all Americans can lead longer, \nmore productive lives.  The Fund invests $15 billion over 10 years to help prevent disease, detect \nit early, and manage conditions before they become severe.  By concentrating on the causes of \nchronic disease, the Affordable Care Act helps move the Nation from a focus on sickness and \ndisease to one based on wellness and prevention. \n \nAs the President indicated in the State of the Union, the Administration is eager to work with the \nCongress to improve the Affordable Care Act by making care better and more affordable.  Rather \nthan making refinements to improve the law, H.R. 1217 simply proposes to eliminate the \nPrevention and Public Health Fund and rescind funds.  The bill neither advances the key \nobjectives of the Affordable Care Act of better and more affordable care nor offers alternative \nsolutions for meeting these important objectives.  It instead repeals the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund and could worsen the Nation\u2019s health and increase system costs by defunding \nprevention activities such as programs that promote physical activity, reduce the burden of \nchronic disease, and prevent smoking and other tobacco use.   \n \nThe Administration will continue to work with the Congress to responsibly implement the \nAffordable Care Act.  However, the Administration will strongly oppose legislation that attempts \nto erode the important provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are making health care more \naffordable and accessible for all Americans.

The Administration is committed to ensuring the \nNation lives within its means and reducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the \nglobal economy and win the future.  That is why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal \nframework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, supports economic growth and long-term job \ncreation, protects critical investments, meets the commitments made to provide dignity and \nsecurity to Americans no matter their circumstances, and provides for our national security.  \n \nWhile overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of \nongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional \nleadership on the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, the Administration would like to take this \nopportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill. \n \nOverseas Construction Funding.  The Administration is concerned about the reduction in \nfunding for military construction projects in Bahrain as well as those associated with the \nrelocation of United States Marines to Guam.  Deferring or eliminating these projects could \nsignal that the U.S. does not stand by its allies or its agreements such as the realignment of forces \nfrom Okinawa to Guam. \n \nMilitary Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for critical \nmilitary construction projects but is concerned with the use of incremental funding that would \nnot support usable segments for the following projects:  Aviation Complex, Fort Wainwright, \nAlaska; Mountainview Operations Center, Buckley Air Force Base, Colorado; Ambulatory Care \nCenter, Joint Base Andrews, Maryland; Ambulatory Care Center, Joint Base San Antonio, \nTexas; and Guam Strike Fuel Systems Maintenance Hangar, Joint Region Marianas, Guam.  \nIncremental funding of military construction projects runs counter to sound budgeting principles \nand fiscal discipline. \n \nConstitutional Concerns.  Section 113 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require \nthe Executive Branch, without discretion, to notify the Congress 30 days in advance of certain \nmilitary exercises, which would intrude on the President's discharge of his constitutional \nauthorities and duties to protect national security.

However, the Administration has \nserious concerns with several provisions, including those described below, that would invite conflict \nbetween the branches of government.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to reviewing the updated classified annex accompanying \nH.R. 1892.  In a letter from the Director of National Intelligence dated August 30, 2011, the \nAdministration identified specific provisions in the Senate classified annex that also raised serious \nconcerns.  If H.R. 1892 is presented to the President and includes the issues of concern described \nbelow and includes, but does not adequately address, the specific provisions of the Senate classified \nannex, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend a veto.   \n \nSubmission of Information on Detainees Held at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 307 and 309, which would state that the DNI \nmust provide the Intelligence Committees with each Department of State cable, memorandum, or \nreport containing certain information relating to Guantanamo Bay detainees, as well as government-\nto-government assurances related to the transfer of those detainees.  The Administration believes \nthat such disclosure will have a significant adverse impact on the willingness of foreign partners, \nwho often expressly request this information not be disseminated, to communicate frankly on these \nmatters. \n \nThe cables and other documents at issue \u2013 originated and controlled by the Department of State, not \nthe ODNI \u2013 contain deliberative commentary and sensitive diplomatic discussions and negotiations, \nincluding commitments made by foreign governments relating to the handling of transferred \ndetainees.  The Department of State has accordingly declined to produce these documents to \nCongress or to U.S. federal courts because of the need to protect diplomatic communications in \nconducting effective foreign relations.  The Administration is concerned that these provisions may \nconflict with the Executive Branch's constitutional authority to control the disclosure of information \nwhen necessary to preserve the Executive's ability to perform its constitutional responsibilities.  \n \nConfirmation of Appointment of the Director of the National Security Agency:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 421, which would add a requirement that the person nominated for the \nposition of Director of the National Security Agency be confirmed by the Senate.  The \nAdministration believes that if this provision were to become law, a critical national security \nposition would likely remain unfilled for a significant period of time, adversely impacting the \nmanagement and function of the National Security Agency. \n  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJune 6, 2012 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 436 \u2013 Health Care Cost Reduction Act of 2012 \n(Rep. Paulson, R-Minnesota, and 240 cosponsors) \n \nThe Affordable Care Act made significant improvements to the Nation's health care system that \nare helping to improve individuals' health and give American families and small business owners \nmore control of their own health care.  These important changes include: ending the worst \npractices of insurance companies; giving uninsured individuals and small business owners the \nsame kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress have; and bringing \ndown the cost of health care for families and businesses while also reducing Federal budget \ndeficits. \n \nH.R. 436, which would repeal the medical device excise tax, does not advance these goals.  The \nmedical device industry, like others, will benefit from an additional 30 million potential \nconsumers who will gain health coverage under the Affordable Care Act starting in 2014.  This \nexcise tax is one of several designed so that industries that gain from the coverage expansion will \nhelp offset the cost of that expansion. \n \nThis tax break, as well as other provisions in the legislation relating to tax-favored health \nspending arrangements, would be funded by increased repayments of the Affordable Care Act's \nadvance premium tax credits, which would raise taxes on middle-class and low-income families, \nin many cases totaling thousands of dollars, notwithstanding that they followed the rules.  This \nlegislation would also increase the number of uninsured Americans. \n \nIn sum, H.R. 436 would fund tax breaks for industry by raising taxes on middle-class and low-\nincome families.  Instead of working together to reduce health care costs, H.R. 436 chooses to \nrefight old political battles over health care.

As stated previously, the \nAdministration is committed to cutting spending and reducing the deficit so that current \nGovernment spending does not add to the debt, and has put forward a plan to do just that. \nHowever, the Administration does not support deep cuts that will undermine our ability to out-\neducate, out-build, and out-innovate the rest of the world.  The unbalanced bill would undermine \nthe Nation\u2019s economic recovery and its ability to succeed in a complex global environment.  If \nthe President is presented with a bill that undermines critical priorities or national security \nthrough funding levels or restrictions, contains earmarks, or curtails the drivers of long-term \neconomic growth and job creation while continuing to burden future generations with deficits, \nthe President will veto the bill.  \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the Inouye substitute amendment 149, \nwhich responds to the Administration\u2019s call to meet the House half-way in achieving the $102 \nbillion in reductions that advocates for H.R. 1 have proposed.  The amendment is a fair \ncompromise and, unlike H.R. 1, does not undermine the Nation\u2019s economic recovery and long-\nterm growth. \n \nThe Administration will continue to work with the Congress to reduce spending and do so in a \nmanner that reflects sound economic policy, protects key investments, and allows critical \nGovernment functions to operate without interruption for the remainder of the fiscal year \nunderway.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \nDecember 7, 2011 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1633 \u2013 Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act \n(Rep. Noem, R-SD, and 121 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1633.  As drafted, this bill would create serious \nproblems for implementing Clean Air Act (CAA) public health protections that have been in \nplace for years while adding uncertainty for businesses and States.  The bill therefore, goes far \nbeyond its stated intent of prohibiting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from \ntightening national standards for coarse particles, which the Administration has repeatedly \nexplained that it has no intention of doing.  \n \nThis ambiguously written bill would create high levels of regulatory uncertainty regarding \nemission control requirements that have been in place for years.  Specifically, the bill's exclusion \nfrom the entire CAA of a new class of air pollutants called \"nuisance dust\" (an imprecise and \nscientifically-undefined term) could be used to roll back existing public health protection \nlimiting pollution from mining operations, industrial activities, and possibly other sources.  The \nbill also raises serious issues about whether EPA could continue to implement the existing \nhealth-based fine and coarse particle programs, which play a vital, ongoing role in preventing \nadverse health effects of air pollution including premature deaths, childhood asthma attacks and \nother respiratory problems.  \n \nFurther, this bill is unnecessary, as it purports to address a problem that does not exist.  \nResponding to false claims that EPA intended to tighten regulation of coarse particles EPA has \nrepeatedly explained that it plans to retain the existing coarse particulate standard, which \noriginally went into effect in 1987 and remains adequately protective of public health. \n \nThis Administration remains committed to commonsense approaches to improving air quality \nacross the country and preserving the competitiveness of every economic sector.  Because H.R. \n1633 is not only unnecessary, but also could have significant adverse public health \nconsequences, the Administration strongly opposes the bill.  \n \nIf H.R. 1633 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n  July 25, 2012 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 3412 \u2013 Middle Class Tax Cut Act  \n(Sen. Reid, D-NV) \n  \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3412 to prevent income taxes from \ngoing up at the start of next year on millions of middle-class Americans.   \n \nIf the Congress does not act, a typical middle-class family of four will see its taxes rise next year \nby $2,200 \u2013 a sizable financial hit for middle-class families that could hardly come at a worse \ntime.  By extending middle-class income tax relief for an additional year, S. 3412 will provide \ncertainty to the 98 percent of Americans with incomes of less than $250,000 (for married \ncouples) that their income taxes will not go up next year \u2013 strengthening the recovery by helping \nspur economic growth and job creation.   \n \nExtending middle-class tax cuts means continuing the temporary income tax relief currently \nscheduled to expire at the end of the year for the first $250,000 of income for married couples.  If \nthis temporary tax relief is not extended, over 35 million families will receive a smaller Child \nTax Credit, while millions of low- and moderate-income working families will lose access to the \ncredit altogether; 11 million middle-class families will no longer get help paying for college from \nthe American Opportunity Tax Credit; married couples will see a tax increase of up to $890 from \nthe expiration of the 10 percent tax bracket; and nearly 38 million middle-class couples will lose \nthe temporary relief they are receiving from marriage penalties.  Under the legislation, 97 percent \nof small businesses owners would continue to receive tax cuts on their business income, and \nsmall businesses that are investing in the economy will be able to claim immediate tax \ndeductions for $250,000, rather than just $25,000, of new investments. \n \nWhile preventing any income tax increases on 114 million American families earning less than \n$250,000, acceptable middle-class tax relief would not extend the tax cuts on income above that \namount.  But households at all income levels would benefit from middle-class tax relief.  S. 3412 \nis similar to the President's proposal to extend the middle-class tax relief.  Under the President\u2019s \nproposal, even households with incomes over $1 million will continue to receive tax cuts \naveraging more than $10,000 from lower tax rates on their first $250,000 of income.  In contrast, \nif all of the tax cuts were extended, including those that go only to the top 2 percent of \nhouseholds, tax cuts for households with incomes over $1 million would average about \n$160,000. \n \nRather than continuing the unaffordable and unneeded tax cuts for the highest-income 2 percent \nof Americans, middle-class tax relief, such as S. 3412, asks the best off to contribute to deficit \nreduction by paying income taxes at the same rates as during the 1990s, when the economy  created nearly 23 million new jobs and the largest budget surplus in American history.  Relative \nto S. 3412, continuing all of the income tax cuts for the top 2 percent of households for just one \nmore year would add about $50 billion to the deficit.  Making the high-income tax cuts \npermanent would add about $850 billion to deficits over the next 10 years, or nearly $1 trillion if \nthe cost of proposed estate tax cuts is included as well.  Allowing these tax cuts to expire is an \nessential component of the President's plan for balanced deficit reduction. \n \nThe Administration believes that the Nation's prosperity has always come from an economy that \nis built on a strong and growing middle class.  All sides agree on the need to extend the tax cuts \nfor the middle class \u2013 this legislation reflects that consensus, and should not be held hostage \nwhile debating the merits of another tax cut for the wealthy. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nFebruary 27, 2012 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n  H.R. 2117 \u2013 Protecting Academic Freedom in Higher Education Act \n  (Rep.

Rogers, R-KY)  \n \nThe Administration has serious concerns about the content of H.R. 2112, making appropriations \nfor Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \nprograms for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012, and for other purposes.  The \nAdministration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means and reducing the \ndeficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  That is why the \nPresident put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, \nsupports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, and meets \nthe commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their \ncircumstances.   \n \nWhile overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of \nongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional \nleadership on the Nation\u2019s long-term fiscal picture, the bill provides insufficient funding for a \nnumber of programs in a way that undermines core government functions and investments key to \neconomic growth and job creation.  Programs adversely affected by the bill include:  \n \nFood and Nutrition Service (FNS).  The Administration strongly objects to the level of funding \nprovided for nutrition programs that are critical to the health of nutritionally at-risk women, \ninfants, children, and elderly adults.  The proposed funding levels would lead to hundreds of \nthousands of participants being cut from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for \nWomen, Infants and Children (WIC) and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and \nreduce Federal support for food banks.  These cuts would undermine efforts to prevent hunger \nand support sound nutrition for some of the most vulnerable members of our society. \n \nFood Safety.  The Administration is concerned with the funding provided in the bill for the \nDepartment of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA\u2019s) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) which will \nsignificantly hamper USDA\u2019s ability to inspect food processing plants and prevent food borne \nillnesses and disease such as E. coli and Salmonella from contaminating America\u2019s food supply.  \nThe Committee\u2019s recommendation may require the agency to furlough employees including \nfrontline inspectors which make up over 80 percent of FSIS staff.   By reducing FSIS \ninspections, food processing plants may be forced to reduce line speeds, which could lead to \ndecreasing product output and profits, as well as plant closures.    \n \nHealthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI).  The Administration is concerned that the bill does \nnot support HFFI, which is a key initiative to combat childhood obesity.  HFFI will expand \nUSDA\u2019s activities to bring healthy foods to low-income Americans and increase the availability \nof affordable, healthy foods in underserved urban and rural communities by bringing grocery  stores and other fresh food retailers to \u201cfood desert\u201d communities where there is little or no \naccess to healthy food.  \n \nResearch.  The bill provides insufficient funds for USDA research programs, which are needed \nto help solve food production, safety, quality, energy and environmental problems.  By reducing \nfunding for the Agricultural Research Service to its lowest level since 2004 as well as \ninadequately funding the Nation\u2019s competitive grant program, the bill will hinder the \nDepartment\u2019s ability to develop solutions to address current as well as impending critical \nnational and international challenges.  \n \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Administration is concerned that the funding level in \nthe bill and resulting staff reductions will severely limit the FDA\u2019s ability to protect the public\u2019s \nhealth, assure the American consumer that food and medical products are safe, and improve \nAmericans\u2019 access to safe and less costly generic drugs and biologics.  \n \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The Administration strongly objects to the \nfunding level for CFTC, as it would cause a cut in staffing levels and seriously undermine \nCFTC\u2019s ability to protect investors and consumers by effectively policing the futures and swaps \nmarketplace through its current market oversight and enforcement functions.  Moreover, the \nfunding level would significantly curtail the timely, effective implementation of the Dodd-Frank \nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, including new CFTC responsibilities to \nregulate the $300 trillion swaps derivatives market. \n \nInternational Food Aid.  The Administration opposes the level of funding provided for the Food \nfor Peace Title II international food aid program as it would severely limit the United States\u2019 \nability to provide food assistance in response to emergencies and disasters around the world.  \nGiven a statutory floor on non-emergency development food aid, a reduction would be borne \nentirely by the emergency component of the program, and would prevent distribution of \nemergency food aid to over 11 million beneficiaries.  \n \nIn addition, the bill includes the following problematic policy and language issues:  \n \nRestrictions on Finalizing USDA Regulations.  The Administration opposes the inclusion of \nsection 721 of the bill, which effectively prevents USDA\u2019s Grain Inspection, Packers and \nStockyards Administration from finalizing a rule on conduct that would violate the Packers and \nStockyards Act of 1921.  The final rule has not yet been published and any concerns about the \nrule are better addressed through the standard rulemaking process than through an appropriations \nrider.  \n \nRestrictions on FDA Regulations and Guidance.  The Administration strongly opposes section \n740 of the bill, which would undermine or nullify FDA statutory standards that have been in \nplace for decades and that are essential to protect the health of Americans.  The provision would \nunduly limit the factors that FDA considers in determining the best ways to protect the public \nfrom unsafe foods; protect the safety of the blood supply from HIV, West Nile Virus, and other \ninfections; ensure the safety of infant formula; protect patients from drugs and medical devices \nthat have not been shown to be safe and effective; assure that food labeling and health claims on \nfoods are accurate; and reduce youth use of tobacco products and otherwise reduce illness and \ndeath caused by tobacco use.  \n \n2  WTO Trade Dispute.  The Administration is concerned by a provision in section 743 that would \neliminate payments that are being made as part of the mutually agreed settlement of a World \nTrade Organization (WTO) dispute regarding U.S. domestic cotton supports and the export credit \nguarantee program.  The framework serves as a basis to avoid trade-related countermeasures by \nBrazil that are authorized by the WTO until the enactment of successor legislation to the current \nFarm Bill.  Under the agreement, the United States is committed to fund technical assistance and \ncapacity-building support for Brazil\u2019s cotton sector.  The bill\u2019s provision preempts the resolution \nprocess and would open the door to retaliation negatively affecting U.S. exports and interests.  \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are \nbeyond the scope of funding legislation.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations process moves forward to ensure the Administration can support enactment of the \nlegislation. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nOctober 17, 2011 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2112 \u2014 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 2012 \n(Sen.

A strong agricultural sector requires \ninvestment in innovation and clean energy technologies, access to health care and healthy food, \nand support for job creating measures like increased agricultural exports.   \n \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) \n \nFood and Nutrition Service.  The Administration strongly supports funding for nutrition \nprograms that are critical to the health of nutritionally at-risk women, infants, children, and \nelderly adults.  The funding provided for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for \nWomen, Infants, and Children could constrain some of the important services and activities \ncurrently supported by the program, and might require the Administration to use contingency \nfunds to cover regular program costs.  The Administration encourages the Senate to fund the \ncontingency fund for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at the President's \nFY 2011 Budget level of $5 billion.  The SNAP contingency fund typically holds in reserve \nabout three to four weeks' worth of benefits to cover unforeseen events, such as disasters and \nfluctuations in food prices. \n \nFood Safety and Inspection Service.  The Administration appreciates the funding provided for \nUSDA's meat and poultry inspection activities, which will maintain current agency operations \nand continue to ensure the safety of the Nation's meat and poultry supply. \n \nCombatting Food Deserts.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide funding for the \nHealthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI), which is a key component of the Administration's  efforts to combat childhood obesity.  HFFI will expand USDA's activities to bring healthy foods \nto low-income Americans and increase the availability of affordable, healthy foods in \nunderserved urban and rural communities by bringing grocery stores and other fresh food \nretailers to \"food desert\" communities where there is little or no access to healthy food. \n \nInternational Food Assistance.  The Administration supports the Senate bill's level of over $1.56 \nbillion for Food for Peace Title II international food aid.  This level allows the Administration to \nrespond to major emergencies, including the current famine in the Horn of Africa, which \nhighlights the critical importance of these funds. \n \nProgram Terminations and Reductions. The Administration urges the Senate to accept additional \nsavings from terminations and reductions proposed in the President's Budget for USDA, \nincluding termination of Rural Housing Services small loan and grant programs and reductions \nin single family housing direct loans and housing repair grants. Adopting these terminations and \nreductions will free up scarce resources for higher-priority needs and more effective programs \nsuch as food safety. \n \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) \n \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Administration strongly supports robust funding for \nFDA to continue implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act, which includes \nestablishing science-based prevention standards, conducting increased and more effective \ninspections, improving oversight of imports, and investing in the development of medical \nproducts, including countermeasures for biodefense threats.  The Administration requested a \n$287 million increase in budget authority for FDA above FY 2011 enacted levels, and the Senate \nbill provides a $49 million increase.  The Administration strongly urges the Senate to provide no \nless than the $2.5 billion currently in the Senate bill.  In FY 2012, FDA must have sufficient \nresources to achieve its essential mission of protecting the public's health, assuring that food and \nmedical products are safe, and improving Americans' access to safe and less costly generic drugs \nand biologics. \n \nDivision 2 \u2013 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \n \nThe Administration urges the Senate to ensure that the Congress is adequately investing in \ninnovation and job creation, community safety, and cutting-edge science and technology, which are \ncritical to our economic growth, security, and global competitiveness.  Research and education \ngrants, space technology, and satellite coverage are all central to this achieving these goals.   \n \nDepartment of Commerce (DOC) \n \nJoint Polar Satellite System (JPSS).  The Administration appreciates the significant increase \nprovided by the Senate, but notes that the bill falls short of the funding needed to maintain the \ncurrent estimated launch date in FY 2017.  The Administration encourages the Senate to provide \nfunding for JPSS at no less than the current Senate level; without sufficient funding for JPSS the \nNation faces a significant risk of a gap in satellite coverage that will result in degraded weather \nforecasts and, in turn, potential negative impacts on public safety and weather-sensitive sectors \nsuch as agriculture and transportation. \n \nCensus Bureau.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide no less than $690 million for \nPeriodic Censuses and Programs.  This funding is needed to initiate the 2012 Economic Census, \n2  which is a critical program that provides benchmarks for Gross Domestic Product estimates. \n \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The Administration urges the Senate to \nprovide strong funding for NIST's intramural research programs, to support current innovation \nactivities and cybersecurity initiatives.  NIST programs provide vital contributions to advancing \nthe Nation's innovation and competitiveness, funding crucial research in areas such as advanced \nmanufacturing and nanotechnology.  The Administration also urges the Senate to support the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership and AMTech programs to help revitalize America's \nmanufacturing sector. \n \nInternational Trade Administration (ITA).  The Administration urges the Senate to provide $451 \nmillion to adequately fund ITA.  The export promotion and trade enforcement activities \nsupported by ITA's components of the National Export Initiative will help American businesses \ngenerate sales abroad and create jobs. \n \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Service.  The \nAdministration appreciates the Senate bill's support for a Climate Service line office, and urges \nthe Senate to approve this realignment of existing NOAA programs.  A Climate Service will \nimprove the performance of roughly $340 million in related programs that are currently spread \nacross three NOAA line offices.  The Administration also supports the Senate bill's overall \nfunding level for NOAA's research efforts. \n \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) \n \nState and Local Assistance.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide the FY 2011 \nenacted level of $245 million to the Community Oriented Policing Services' Hiring Grants \nProgram to hire and retain State and local police officers.  The funding level in the Senate bill \nwould only support about 1,400 jobs whereas funding at the FY 2011 enacted level would \nsupport 1,900 jobs.  The Administration also urges the Senate to restore funding for Second \nChance Act programs to aid the successful reentry of returning prisoners.  In addition, the \nAdministration supports adequate funding for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants program \n(including Criminal Justice Innovation) to support law enforcement. \n \nFederal Prison System.  The Administration supports the level of funding in the Senate bill for \nthe Federal Prison System, which will provide sufficient resources to keep pace with the \ncontinued growth in the inmate population and inflationary increases including inmate medical \nand food costs.  Additionally, the Bureau of Prisons would be able to staff and begin operating \nseveral prisons that have been or will be fully constructed. \n \nGeneral Legal Activities and Administrative Review and Appeals (GLA and ARA).  The \nAdministration urges the Senate to provide $899 million for GLA, $53 million above the \nCommittee bill, and $318 million for ARA, $24 million above the Committee bill, to ensure full-\nyear funding for immigration judges and the new attorneys recently added for high-priority work, \nsuch as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and civil rights enforcement.  Much of the Executive \nOffice for Immigration Review's (EOIR) workload is tied directly to Department of Homeland \nSecurity enforcement efforts, with EOIR caseload reaching over 400,000 in FY 2011 and \ncontinuing to grow.  GLA's civil rights work includes important initiatives such as prosecuting \nhate crimes and enforcing the voting rights of members of the Armed Services. \n \nProgram Terminations and Reductions.  The Administration urges the Senate to adopt the \n3  President's proposed terminations and reductions, including the $137 million reduction to the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program, which would free up scarce resources that could be \nredirected toward higher priority needs and programs that have a greater potential for results. \n \nAsset Forfeiture Fund.  The Administration encourages the Senate to rescind a total of $675 \nmillion from the Asset Forfeiture Fund, which is $55 million more than the rescission in the \nCommittee bill.  Recent deposits into the Fund resulting from fraud and other investigations \njustify the higher rescission amount. \n \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) \n \nThe Administration urges the Senate to maintain the current bill level of $6 million.  This \nfunding will enable OSTP to continue leading interagency efforts to develop and implement \nsound science and technology policies. \n \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \n \nSpace Launch System and Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle.  The Administration appreciates the \nSenate bill's support for the Space Launch System and Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle programs.  \nThese systems are key elements of America's future human space exploration efforts. \n \nCommercial Crew Program.  The Administration encourages the Senate to provide sufficient \nfunding for the Commercial Crew Program to avoid delaying the development of U.S. crew \ntransport capabilities and lengthening the period during which the United States will need to pay \nRussia to transport crew to the International Space Station. \n \nJames Webb Space Telescope.  The Administration appreciates the Senate's support for this \nproject, which will advance our understanding of the universe and was given high priority by the \nastronomy and astrophysics community.  \n \nSpace Technology.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide NASA the level of funding \nincluded in the Senate Committee bill.  NASA's ability to create an effective space technology \ndevelopment pipeline is key to making America's future missions to deep space affordable and \nachievable and to strengthening the Nation's space industry and capabilities.   \n \nNational Science Foundation (NSF) \n \nThe Administration supports strong funding for NSF, and appreciates the flexibility provided in \nthe bill to transfer funding between accounts.  NSF's grants are critical to America's scientific \nleadership and its competitiveness.   \n \nUnited States Trade Representatives (USTR) \n \nThe Administration urges the Senate to provide $51.3 million for USTR.  The funding in the \nSenate bill would undermine USTR's ability to pursue trade enforcement cases and participate in \ntrade negotiations like the Trans Pacific Partnership.  USTR is critical to our goal of increasing \nAmerican exports. \n \nLegal Services Corporation (LSC)  \n \n4  The Administration strongly supports the Senate bill's level of $396 million and the language in \nthe bill to lift restrictions on the use of non-LSC funds by LSC grantees. \n \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) \n \nThe Administration supports maintaining funding for the EEOC to help the agency fulfill its \ncritical mission of enforcing antidiscrimination laws.  Funding reductions could lead to growth in \nEEOC's private sector charge backlog, leaving those who have suffered discrimination waiting \nlonger to seek legal relief. \n \nBill-Wide Provision \n \nFighting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.  While section 527 of the bill aims to serve the important \ngoal of combatting waste, fraud, and abuse, as written the provision would deny agencies the \nability to make informed decisions about contracts, grants, and other Federal assistance.  It thus \nrisks causing unintended consequences that could translate into unwarranted penalties on \nbusinesses and unjustified costs on taxpayers.   \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSeveral provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  Sections 113(a), 510, 522, and 528 of \nthe bill would effectively direct the manner or substance of the Executive's international \nnegotiations, where the President's constitutional authority is exclusive.  The Administration \nlooks forward to working with the Senate to address these concerns.  In addition, the \nAdministration objects to and has constitutional concerns about section 532 of the bill.  This \nprovision's restrictions on the transfer of detainees to the United States and to the custody or \neffective control of foreign countries or entities in the context of an ongoing armed conflict may \ninterfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees \nand to make important foreign policy and national security determinations regarding whether and \nunder what circumstances such transfers should occur.  Such restrictions or interferences would, \nin certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles. \n \nDivision 3 \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \n \nThe Administration urges the Senate to provide the resources necessary to continue to invest in \ninfrastructure, housing and community development programs that are critical to the Nation's \neconomic recovery and long-term competitiveness.   \n \nDepartment of Transportation \n \nSurface Transportation Obligation Limitations.  The Administration supports the Senate's \napproach of funding highway, highway safety, and mass transit obligation limitations at baseline \nlevels.  The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to pass:  1) the American \nJobs Act, which includes $50 billion in transportation investments to improve the Nation's \ntransportation system and create and maintain jobs; 2) a long-term reauthorization bill that \ncontinues those critical investments and ensures Highway Trust Fund solvency; and 3) \nInfrastructure Bank legislation, which would leverage private and public capital to invest in a \nbroad range of infrastructure projects of national and regional significance. \n \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The Administration supports funding for FAA's \n5  operations and urges the Senate to fully fund FAA's collectively-bargained personnel expenses.  \nThe Administration also urges the Senate to provide $950 million for NextGen, FAA's air traffic \nmodernization effort, so FAA can continue to make progress in transforming the radar based air \ntraffic control system to a more efficient satellite based system. \n \nAmtrak.  The Administration strongly supports the Senate bill's level for Amtrak, which carried \nmore passengers in fiscal year 2011 than any year since its creation in 1971.  Among those lines \nseeing ridership increases are the State-supported routes; fifteen States have partnered with \nAmtrak to provide improved passenger rail service, resulting in 150 daily trains that carry about \none-third of Amtrak's total ridership.  The Senate proposed levels will ensure these \nimprovements are sustained. \n \nHigh Speed Rail.  The Administration believes that the development of high speed rail corridors \nin the Nation's most densely populated regions, along with improved existing intercity rail \nservice, is critical to having a balanced, well-functioning national transportation network.  The \nAdministration appreciates that the bill includes $100 million for high speed rail projects, and \nsupports funding to continue the progress made over the past three years to improve the Nation's \nintercity passenger rail system. \n \nTIGER Grants.  The Administration supports the Senate bill's level of $550 million for TIGER \ngrants, which are awarded through a competitive selection process to innovative, multi-modal \ntransportation projects, often with substantial State and local co-investment. \n \nEnvironmental Waivers.  The Administration strongly opposes section 128 of the bill that \nincludes exemptions from seven specific statutes, an Executive Order, and any law intended to \nensure adequate protection of wetlands.  The regulations and requirements cited have been in \nplace for decades and there are processes in place that allow for expedited action in the event of \nnatural disasters. \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nRental Assistance Programs.  The Administration appreciates the Senate bill's support for HUD's \ntwo largest rental assistance programs \u2013 Housing Choice Vouchers and Project-Based Rental \nAssistance.  The funding provided for these programs is sufficient to maintain rental assistance \nto current low-income residents.  The Administration also appreciates the Senate's support for \nthe Rental Assistance Demonstration. \n \nPublic Housing Capital Fund.  The Administration urges the Senate to fund the Public Housing \nCapital Fund at no less than the FY 2011 enacted level of $2 billion.  Given a capital needs \nbacklog that exceeds $20 billion, maintaining at least level funding is essential for the \npreservation of critical affordable rental units. \n \nHomeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide additional funds \nfor Homeless Assistance Grants.  Funding provided by the bill would meet the renewal needs for \nContinuum of Care programs and Emergency Solution Grants, but would not enable progress on \nimplementing the HEARTH Act and the Federal Strategic Plan to End Homelessness.  Without \nadditional funding, HUD will be unable to provide rapid housing interventions to nearly 8,400 \ndisabled homeless persons and families, as well as approximately 16,500 households. \n \nPlace-Based Initiatives.  The Administration strongly supports the Senate bill's funding levels for \n6  Choice Neighborhoods and Sustainable Communities.  These initiatives are critical components \nof the Administration place-based efforts to fight concentrated poverty and fund strategic plans \nto integrate housing and transportation investments to expand economic opportunities.  While the \nAdministration appreciates the Senate's support for funding the Strong Cities, Strong \nCommunities (SC2) initiative within HUD's Transformation Initiative (TI) account, the \nAdministration urges the Senate to provide HUD with full discretion to allocate funds to SC2 \nand other TI projects as needed to improve State and local governments' development capacities \nand meet Departmental priorities. \n \nHousing Counseling.  The Administration appreciates the Senate bill's support of Housing \nCounseling at $60 million.  The lack of funding for this program in FY 2011 and the state of the \nhousing market makes it essential to restore base funding for this program.  This funding will \nsupport personal counseling and education to families, largely of moderate or low income, and \nassist them with responses to foreclosure or help them secure affordable housing. \n \nCommunity Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME.  The Administration urges the \nSenate to provide additional funds for the CDBG and the HOME Investment Partnership \nProgram.  The Senate bill's substantial reductions to these two programs would significantly \ndelay\u2014and in some cases stop\u2014infrastructure investments, including affordable housing \ndevelopment, and would have detrimental effects on State and local governments across the \ncountry. \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nInteragency Council on Homelessness.  The Administration supports the level of Senate bill's \nfunding for the Interagency Council on the Homelessness and urges the Senate to provide \npermanent authorization for the agency.  The Interagency Council has been a crucial part of this \nAdministration's goal of ending homelessness in America as laid out in the Federal Strategic \nPlan. \n \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n7  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMay 17, 2011 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 953 \u2013 Offshore Production and Safety Act of 2011  \n(Sen. McConnell, R-KY, and 17 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas \nproduction as part of a broad energy strategy that will protect consumers and reduce our \ndependence on oil.  Safety and environmental reforms that the Administration implemented in \nresponse to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill are critical to achieving those objectives.  These \nreforms strengthen requirements for issues ranging from well design to workplace safety to \ncorporate accountability, and they require operators to show that they can contain a subsea oil \nspill like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  S. 953 generally would undercut these critical \nreforms; therefore, the Administration opposes S. 953.  \n \nS. 953 would undermine the Administration's work to ensure that environmental analysis \nrequired by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is conducted in a rigorous manner.  \nS. 953 would hastily open areas of the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and the Atlantic to leasing, and \nrequire the Department of the Interior (DOI) to hold multiple lease sales in the Gulf and Alaska \nusing outdated NEPA analysis that was conducted before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The \nAdministration has strengthened NEPA analysis in light of lessons learned from the spill and is \ncommitted to responsible development in the Gulf and the Arctic.  DOI intends to hold the Gulf \nlease sales referenced in the bill by mid-2012.  With respect to Alaska, DOI has committed to \nholding annual lease sales in the National Petroleum Reserve while respecting sensitive areas, \nencouraging development of existing leases by establishing a high-level interagency working \ngroup to coordinate the permitting process (including necessary environmental and safety \nreviews), and extending certain offshore leases.   \n \nS. 953 would constrain the ability of DOI to ensure that permits meet safety standards by \nrequiring permitting decisions to be made within 30 days of receiving an application, thereby \ncurtailing the review period.  Two 15-day extensions would be possible, though DOI would be \nrequired to submit burdensome justifications.  The bill would grant permits automatically at the \nend of this 60-day window, regardless of whether the applicant satisfied safety standards.  These \nconcerns also arise over environmental safeguards and reviews.  The Administration believes \nthese statutory time constraints are unwarranted.  Fifty-three new shallow water permits have \nbeen issued since the Administration's stronger safety standards were put in place, and deepwater \npermit applications also are being processed in a timely manner.  Since the end of February, \nwhen industry first demonstrated to safety regulators the capability to contain a subsea spill, \nfourteen deepwater wells have been permitted. \n \nS. 953 also would require the Secretary of the Interior to grant an automatic one-year suspension \nof leases (effectively extending the term of the leases) in the Gulf.  The Administration fully \nsupports suspensions for Gulf leaseholders directly impacted by the drilling moratorium.  Ten \nsuch suspensions have already been granted using administrative procedures to leaseholders who  demonstrated that they were affected by the moratoria. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \nDecember 6, 2011 \n            (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 10 \u2013 Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2011 \n(Rep. Davis, R-Kentucky, and 204 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, and \ntailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner.  Accordingly, \nthe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 10, the Regulations From the \nExecutive in Need of Scrutiny Act, which would impose an unprecedented requirement that a \njoint resolution of approval be enacted by the Congress before any major rule of Executive \nBranch agencies could have force or effect.  This radical departure from the longstanding \nseparation of powers between the Executive and Legislative branches would delay and, in many \ncases, thwart implementation of statutory mandates and execution of duly enacted laws, increase \nbusiness uncertainty, undermine much-needed protections of the American public, and create \nunnecessary confusion. \n \nThere is no justification for such an unprecedented requirement.  When a Federal agency \npromulgates a major rule, it must already adhere to the particular requirements of the statute that \nit is implementing and to the constraints imposed by other Federal statutes and the \nConstitution.  Indeed, in many cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the \nparticular rule.  The agency must also comply with the rulemaking requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551, et seq.).  When it issues a major rule, the agency \nmust perform analyses of benefits and costs that typically are required by one or more statutes \n(such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork \nReduction Act) as well as by Executive Order 12866. \n \nIn addition, this Administration has already taken numerous steps to reduce regulatory costs and \nto ensure that all major regulations are designed to maximize net benefits to society.  Most \nrecently, Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased public \nparticipation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a \nregulatory retrospective review.  Finally, agency rules are subject to Federal courts. \n \nMoreover, for the past 15 years, the Congress itself has had the opportunity, under the \nCongressional Review Act of 1996 (CRA), to review on an individual basis the rules \u2013 both \nmajor and non-major \u2013 that Federal agencies have issued.  \n \nBy replacing this well established framework with a blanket requirement of Congressional \napproval, H.R. 10 would throw all major regulations into a months-long limbo, fostering \nuncertainty and impeding business investment that is vital to economic growth.  Maintaining an \nappropriate allocation of responsibility between the two branches is essential to ensuring that the \nNation's regulatory system effectively protects public health, welfare, safety, and our  environment, while also promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job \ncreation.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 10, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMay 23, 2011 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 1038 \u2013 PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011  \n(Sen.

These authorities, which expire after May 26, 2011 absent \nextension, are:  (1) section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority for roving \nsurveillance of targets who take steps that may thwart Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n(FISA) surveillance; (2) section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority to \ncompel production of business records and other tangible things with the approval of the FISA \ncourt; and (3) section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which \nprovides authority under FISA to target non-U.S. persons who engage in international terrorism \nor activities in preparation therefor, but are not necessarily associated with an identified terrorist \ngroup (the so-called \"lone wolf\" provision).

The Senate amendment will \nprovide the necessary resources to continue ongoing response and recovery efforts, while helping \nimpacted communities effectively mitigate future risk of disaster to prevent losses of this \nmagnitude from recurring.  \n \nThe amendment ensures urgent and essential needs are being met, while recognizing the need to \nprevent losses of this magnitude from future disasters.

Stabenow, D-MI) \nThe Administration supports Senate passage of S. 3240, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs \nAct of 2012, and looks forward to working with the Congress to address the important concerns \ndescribed below prior to final passage. \nThe Administration greatly appreciates the Senate's bipartisan efforts to enact a farm bill.  With \nauthorization for farm- and food-related programs set to expire this year, it is critical that the \nCongress pass legislation that provides certainty for rural America and includes needed reforms \nand savings.  The new farm bill should promote rural development, preserve a farm safety net, \nmaintain strong nutrition programs, enhance conservation, honor our World Trade Organization \ncommitments, and advance agricultural research.  In light of the Nation's long-term fiscal \nchallenge, the legislation should also contribute significantly to deficit reduction.    \nThe Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, S. 3240, makes meaningful progress \ntoward the Administration's goals.  Notable reforms include eliminating the direct payment \nsystem; tightening payment and eligibility requirements; strengthening access to healthy, \naffordable food; protecting emergency food aid programs and authorities; and increasing \nflexibility in the delivery of international food aid.  The Administration supports the Senate's \nefforts to consolidate and streamline conservation assistance, which will reduce administrative \nburdens on farmers and ranchers and improve environmental outcomes.  The bill's funding for \nbioenergy programs will enhance our energy security while supporting innovation and growth in \nrural economies.   \n \nConsistent with the President's Budget, the Administration looks forward to working with the \nCongress to achieve crop insurance and commodity program savings that are not contained in S. \n3240, while at the same time strengthening the farm safety net in times of need and supporting \nthe next generation of farmers.  The Administration also strongly supports the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a cornerstone of our Nation's food assistance safety net, \nwhich is why it was not subject to cuts in the President's Budget.  SNAP helps families put food \non the table, while also benefitting farm and rural economies.  The Administration also looks \nforward to working with the Congress to structure reporting requirements and the proposed \nResearch Foundation in ways that will maximize and facilitate agricultural research. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nOctober 25, 2011 \n                                                            (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 674 \u2013 Repeal of the Three Percent Withholding on Government Vendors \n(Rep. Herger, R-CA, and 269 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration supports passage of H.R. 674, which would repeal a three percent \nwithholding on certain payments made to private contractors by Federal, State, and local \ngovernment entities.   \n \nThe repeal of the withholding requirement in H.R. 674 would reduce a burden on government \ncontractors who otherwise comply with their tax obligations, particularly small businesses.  As \nevidenced in the President\u2019s proposed American Jobs Act, released September 12, 2011, the \nAdministration has supported alleviating this burden, which was originally enacted into law on \nMay 17, 2006.  The Administration also believes it is important to ensure that Federal \ncontractors are compliant with tax laws and supports more targeted efforts that prevent persons \nwith outstanding tax debts from receiving Federal contracts.  The effect of the repeal of the \nwithholding requirement would be to avoid a decrease in cash flow to these contractors, which \nwould allow them to retain these funds and use them to create jobs and pay suppliers.  This \nwould complement the Administration\u2019s other efforts to help small businesses.  Repeal of the \nwithholding requirement would also reduce implementation costs borne by Federal and other \ngovernmental agencies.  The Administration would be willing to work with the Congress to \nidentify acceptable offsets for the budgetary costs associated with the repeal, which could \ninclude but are not limited to ones that are in the President\u2019s detailed blueprint outlined to the \nCongress on September 19, 2011.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n  July 21, 2011 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2584 \u2014 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct, 2012 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2584, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2012.  The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means and \nreducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  That \nis why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 \ntrillion, supports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, meets \nthe commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their circumstances, \nand provides for our national security.   \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes a number of provisions in this bill, including ideological and \npolitical provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the President is presented \nwith a bill that undermines ongoing conservation, public health, and environmental protection \nefforts through funding limits or restrictions, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill. \n \nWhile overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of \nongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership \non the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, the Administration has concerns regarding the level of \nresources the bill would provide for a number of programs in a way that undermines core \ngovernment functions, investments key to economic growth and job creation, as well as protection \nof public health and the environment and preservation of our Nation's natural resource heritage, \nincluding, but not limited to: \n \nDepartment of the Interior (DOI) \n \nFish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Conservation Grants.  The level of funding provided to the North \nAmerican Wetlands Conservation Act and State and Tribal Wildlife grants, as well as the \ntermination of Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act grants, would threaten the ability of \nStates and private organizations to conserve and provide access to habitat, undermining the \nconservation of game and non-game species.  \n \nSafety Inspection Fees.  The bill does not include user fees to cover inspections of oil and gas \nproduction facilities offshore and onshore.  Without these fees, taxpayers, rather than industry, \nwould have to shoulder the cost of these operations, which are critical to ensuring safe and \nresponsible energy development. \n \nFWS Operations.  The funding provided for operations would seriously degrade the ability of FWS \nto maintain the network of National Wildlife Refuges and fulfill other statutory responsibilities.  \nThis would result in delays in environmental compliance reviews, which could impede major  infrastructure projects, including road construction, water delivery, and other federally funded \nprojects that directly benefit State and local governments. \n \nLandsat.  The bill does not provide funding to begin the acquisition of the next Landsat satellite, \nending a 40-year stream of data that is used by Federal, State, local and Tribal governments and the \nprivate sector to make informed land and resource management decisions and to assess the impacts \nof those decisions over time. \n \nDOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service \n \nLand and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).  The funding in the bill for LWCF programs would \ndeny willing sellers the opportunity to sell land holdings, and severely impair the ability of Federal, \nState, and local officials, as well as private landowners, to preserve and manage areas important to \nwildlife, recreationalists, and sportsmen and women. \n \nWildland Fire Suppression.  The bill's funding for suppression is substantially below the 10-year \naverage, which is the accepted method for calculating suppression requirements.  While the bill \ndirects DOI and the Forest Service to use emergency fire suppression balances to make up the \nshortfall, this strategy carries high risk given the high fire activity to date and the cancellation of \nbalances in FY 2011 appropriations. \n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n \nEPA Operating Budget.  At the funding level provided, EPA will be unable to implement its core \nmission of protecting human health and the environment.  Research necessary to support this \nmission will be curtailed, and restoration of key ecosystems such as the Great Lakes and the \nChesapeake Bay will be delayed. \n \nState Revolving Funds (SRFs).  The level of funding provided in the bill would result in \napproximately 400 fewer wastewater and drinking water projects, and impede EPA's ability to reach \nthe long-term goal of providing approximately 5 percent of total water infrastructure funding \nannually. \n \nState Categorical Grants.  The funding provided in the bill for grants to States would impede States' \nability to carry out critical public health and environmental activities such as air quality monitoring \nand water quality permitting.  This would greatly reduce core high-priority State environmental \nprograms at a time of declining State budgets. \n \nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Programs.  The reductions in funding for GHG programs and regulations \nseverely limit actions the Administration could take under current law to permit, control, and \nmonitor greenhouse gases and would block EPA's efforts to reduce GHG emissions from vehicles \nand large stationary sources. \n \nGreat Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI).  The level of resources for the GLRI would reduce the \nability of Federal agencies and their partners to clean up contaminated sediments, fight invasive \nspecies, restore habitat, and improve water quality in this critical ecosystem. \n \nHigh Priority Ecosystems Funding.  The level of funding provided for the Chesapeake Bay would \njeopardize the successful clean-up of the Nation's largest estuary. \n \n2  Responsible Energy Development and Oil Spill Response.  The level of resources in the bill would \neliminate efforts to increase the frequency of environmental compliance inspections at oil facilities.  \nIn addition, the bill does not include emergency transfer authority necessary to improve the \nGovernment's ability to prevent and respond to oil spills. \n \nSmart Growth.  The bill terminates funding for EPA's Smart Growth program, which contributes to \nefforts to assist communities in coordinating infrastructure investments and minimizing \nenvironmental impact of development. \n \nNational Endowment for the Arts (NEA).   \n \nThe funding in the bill for the NEA, which is the largest national funder of the arts in the United \nStates, would cut support for arts organizations across the country during a time when private and \nState arts funding is also highly constrained.  \n \nCouncil on Environmental Quality.   \n \nThe Administration's ability to guide the Executive Branch's environmental policies and programs \nwill be substantially reduced at the funding level in the bill.   \n \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language issues that are beyond the \nscope of funding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill: \n \nRestrictions on Implementing the Endangered Species Act.  Preventing FWS from implementing \nkey provisions of the Endangered Species Act will only result in increased costs and delays in the \nfuture. \n \nMountain Top Mining Reform.  Preventing the Office of Surface Mining from developing or \nimplementing the stream buffer zone rule could increase the risk of litigation and potentially delay \nsustainable coal mining.  \n \nMineral Withdrawal Prohibition.  Prohibiting DOI from restricting new mining claims on \napproximately 1 million acres of Federal lands near the Grand Canyon will reverse a temporary \nmoratorium on new uranium and other mining claims.  The Secretary of the Interior is currently \nassessing the impact to water quality in Grand Canyon National Park to ensure that any future \nuranium or other mining activity in the area does not lead to the human health and environmental \nimpacts seen from previous mining-caused contamination of ground water and drinking water \nsupplies. \n \nGray Wolves.  The Endangered Species Act expressly gives the public the right to challenge listing \ndecisions.  Restricting judicial review of any published final rule to delist gray wolves in Wyoming \nor the Great Lakes region from the Endangered Species Act would deny the public an opportunity \nto make sure that a future listing decision on gray wolves is based on science. \n \nProtecting Wilderness Characteristics Secretarial Order.  Prohibiting the Bureau of Land \nManagement (BLM) from implementing Secretarial Order 3310, which directs BLM to use the \npublic resource management planning process to designate certain lands with wilderness \ncharacteristics as \"Wild Lands\" is unnecessary given the Department's policy that includes \ncollaboration with stakeholders to identify public lands that may be appropriate candidates for \n3  congressional designation under the Wilderness Act. \n \nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Stationary Sources.  Preventing EPA from regulating GHG \nemissions from stationary sources would prevent the Agency from proposing or finalizing new \nregulations to control GHG emissions from power plants and petroleum refineries, increasing the \nrisk of long-term environmental consequences from GHG emissions.  EPA is under two settlement \nagreements to complete these rules in 2012. \n \nClean Air Act Permitting.  Section 431(a)(2-4) of the bill effectively overrides Federal and State-\nissued permits for emissions from industrial facilities that are very large emitters of greenhouse \ngases by stating that the Clean Air Act's requirement to obtain a permit has no legal effect and that \nno lawsuits may be brought against a facility due to uncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions.   \n \nLight-Duty Greenhouse Gas Standards.  Section 453 of the bill undermines Executive Branch \nefforts to set standards that will save consumers money at the pump and reduce GHG emissions \nthrough increased vehicle fuel efficiency on Model Year 2017-2025 Light-Duty Vehicles. \n \nUtility Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT)/Transport Rule.  Section 462 of the bill \nblocks EPA from implementing its utility MACT rule to control air toxics emissions, as well as the \nCross-State Air Pollution Rule controlling interstate transport of nitrogen oxides and particulate \nmatter emissions from power plants.  This provision interferes with the long-delayed \nimplementation of major air pollution rules covering pollution from power plants.  \n \nMountaintop Mining Coordination and Guidance.  Section 433 of the bill prohibits implementing or \nenforcing an EPA/Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)/Office of Surface Mining coordination \nMemorandum of Understanding and EPA guidance on the Clean Water Act/National Environmental \nPolicy Act and mountaintop mining.  This issue is currently undergoing judicial review and should \nbe allowed to conclude without congressional intervention.   \n \nClean Water Act.  Section 435 of the bill would stop an important Administration effort to provide \nclarity around which water bodies are covered by the Clean Water Act.  The Administration's work \nin this area will help to protect the public health and economic benefits provided to the American \npublic by clean water, while also bringing greater certainty to business planning and investment and \nreducing an ongoing loss of wetlands and other sensitive aquatic resources.  The existing \nregulations were the subject of two recent Supreme Court cases, in which the Court itself indicated \nthe need for greater regulatory clarity regarding the appropriate scope of the Clean Water Act \njurisdiction.  \n \nOuter Continental Shelf Drilling.  Section 443 of the bill limits EPA's Clean Air Act permitting \nauthority for Outer Continental Shelf drilling and would eliminate the Agency's discretion in \nconsidering human health and environmental protections when issuing these permits.   \n \nIntegrated Risk Information System.  Section 444 of the bill withholds funding for EPA to take \nadministrative action following its assessment of risk for certain chemicals.  This provision would \ndelay scientific assessment of environmental contaminants and could delay regulatory or other \nAgency actions designed to protect public health.   \n \nLimiting Compliance of the Endangered Species Act.  Section 447 of the bill would prevent EPA \nfrom implementing a biological opinion related to pesticides if the opinion identifies modifying, \ncanceling, or suspending registration of a pesticide registered under FIFRA.  This could undermine \n4  efforts to protect species from being put into jeopardy from a Federal project and could stop \ndevelopment and delay issuance of permits. \n \nLead Renovation and Repair Rule.  Section 450 of the bill prohibits funding for EPA to implement \nthe 2008 Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) rule, as amended, until after industry \ndevelops and EPA approves different lead paint test kits.  This would undermine efforts to protect \nsensitive populations from exposure to lead, a known toxin to children and developing fetuses, \nduring home renovation projects. The currently available test kits allow renovators to comply with \nthe 2008 rule.    \n \nReducing Emissions from Cement Facilities.  The language would prevent common sense \ndeployment of technology that has been around for decades that will improve public health by \nreducing emissions of pollutants, including known carcinogens such as dioxin, from cement \nfacilities. \n \nFighting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.  Sections 449 and 451 of the bill fall short of their intended \npurposes of protecting the interest of the Nation's taxpayers.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress to achieve the common goal of fighting fraud, waste, and abuse in \nFederal contracts, grants, and other Federal assistance. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations process moves forward to ensure the Administration can support enactment of the \nlegislation. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n5  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMarch 8, 2011 \n (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 836 \u2013 Emergency Mortgage Relief Program Termination Act \n(Rep.

The Administration is committed to helping struggling American homeowners stay in \ntheir homes, and has taken many steps over the last two years to stabilize what was a rapidly-\ndeclining housing market.  Over the next 30 months, the EHLP would provide loan assistance to \nas many as 30,000 distressed American homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to involuntary \nunemployment, underemployment, or a medical condition.

Mica, R-Florida, and Rep. Duncan, R-Tennessee) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes the Rules Committee Print of H.R. 7, which includes H.R. \n3408, the Protecting Investment in Oil Shale the Next Generation of Environmental, Energy, and \nResource Security (PIONEERS Act) and H.R. 3813, the Securing Annuities for Federal \nEmployees Act of 2012.  H.R. 7 does not reflect the historically bipartisan nature of the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee. The Administration has serious concerns with \nprovisions in the bill that would make America\u2019s roads, rails, and transit systems less safe, \nreduce the transportation options available to America\u2019s traveling public, short circuit local \ndecision-making, and turn back the clock on environmental and labor protections. \n \nThis bill would reduce safety throughout the Nation\u2019s transportation system by failing to make \nnecessary investments in roads and bridges, limiting funding to State and local governments for \nhighway safety, and repealing requirements that help ensure the safe handling of hazardous \nmaterials by railroads.  The bill also fails to adequately improve transit safety in accordance with \nrecommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board and legislation submitted by the \nAdministration in December 2009.   \n \nH.R. 7 eliminates programs that ensure the Nation\u2019s metropolitan areas have sufficient resources \nto provide multiple transportation options to help reduce congestion.  H.R. 7 also eliminates a \nthirty-year legacy of dedicated transit funding from the Highway Trust Fund.  The bill allocates \nFederal funding for transit in a manner that undermines local decision making regarding the \noperation of local transit systems.  This bill also reduces authorized funding levels for Amtrak \nand loosens the requirements on loan programs, putting taxpayer dollars at risk.  In addition, the \nbill inappropriately targets funding towards systems that carry only a small number of the \nNation's bus passengers.  Finally, while the Administration appreciates that the bill does not \ncontain earmarks, H.R. 7 eliminates funding for a number of discretionary grant programs, \nmissing an opportunity to promote competition and innovation. \n \nH.R. 7 would also significantly weaken environmental protections for transportation projects and \nundermine civic engagement in the decision-making process.  The bill includes arbitrary \ntimelines that deem an environmental and substantive review satisfactory regardless of a \nproject\u2019s complexity and impact. The bill also limits judicial recourse of parties affected by \ntransportation projects in a manner that undermines well-established judicial principles.  \n \nThe Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas \nproduction as part of a broad energy strategy that will protect consumers and reduce the Nation\u2019s \ndependence on foreign oil.  Unfortunately, the bill includes pay-fors that open up pristine natural \nhabitats not suitable for resource extraction and undermine prudent development of the Nation\u2019s \noil and natural gas resources by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to industrial  development, mandating lease sales in new offshore areas with no Secretarial discretion for \ndetermining which areas are appropriate and safe for such exploration and development, and \npreempting a Bureau of Land Management environmental impact statement on oil shale \nextraction.  Further, this bill seeks to circumvent a longstanding process for determining whether \ncross-border pipelines are in the national interest by mandating the permitting of the Keystone \nXL pipeline project despite the fact that the pipeline route has yet to be identified and there is no \ncomplete assessment of its potential impacts, including impacts on health and safety, the \neconomy, foreign policy, energy security, and the environment. \n \nThe Administration is committed to working on a bipartisan basis on a surface transportation \nreauthorization bill that provides the necessary funding to modernize the Nation\u2019s surface \ntransportation infrastructure, increase transportation options, maintain and create good paying \njobs, and ensure lasting economic competitiveness.  Because this bill jeopardizes safety, weakens \nenvironmental and labor protections, and fails to make the investments needed to strengthen the \nNation\u2019s roads, bridges, rail, and transit systems, the President\u2019s senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto this legislation. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \nJuly 13, 2011 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2434 \u2013 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2012 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY)  \n \nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on H.R. 2434, making \nappropriations for financial services and general government programs for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2012.  The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means \nand reducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  \nThat is why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 \ntrillion, supports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, and \nmeets the commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their \ncircumstances.   \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes a number of provisions in this bill.  If the President is \npresented with a bill that undermines either the Affordable Care Act or the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act through funding limits or other restrictions, or reverses \ncurrent policies on Cuba, his senior advisors would recommend a veto. \n \nWhile overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of \nongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership \non the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, the Administration has concerns regarding the level of \nresources the bill would provide for a number of programs in a way that undermines core \ngovernment functions, investments key to economic growth and job creation, as well as national \nsecurity, including: \n \nDepartment of the Treasury \n \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS).  The level of funding provided for the IRS would seriously degrade \nthe quality of services provided to taxpayers and would increase the deficit.  Tax enforcement and \ncompliance activities typically return $7 or more on each taxpayer dollar spent.  The bill would \nerode taxpayer service to the extent that only one out of every two taxpayers would be able to reach \nan IRS customer service representative, and would lead to over 4,200 full-time staff reductions and \nreduce overall revenue collections by $4 billion annually, costing taxpayers far more than the near-\nterm savings generated. \n \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The level of funding provided in the \nbill would reduce the Treasury Department's capacity to provide credit, capital, and financial \nservices to low and moderate-income persons and small businesses in underserved communities.  \nThe bill also includes language that could bar CDFI funds from being used for programs such as the \nHealthy Food Financing Initiative, designed to increase the availability of affordable, healthy food \noutlets in underserved urban and rural communities where there is little or no access to healthy \nfood. \n  Financial Research Fund (FRF).  The Administration objects to the funding level for the FRF, as it \nwould compromise oversight and analyses of financial market risks by restricting its independent \nfunding.  FRF supports the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of \nFinancial Research (OFR), as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act; undercutting FSOC and OFR resources would impede their ability to identify risks \nto the financial stability of the Nation, promote market discipline, and respond to emerging threats \nto the U.S. financial system's stability. \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The Administration opposes the alteration of \nCFPB's mandatory funding structure as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act, which would compromise the Bureau's independence, as well as \nlimitations on the Bureau's expenditures to levels that would severely undercut the agency's \nstatutory responsibility to oversee consumer financial products such as mortgages and credit cards.  \nNot only would the bill's funding limitation severely curtail hiring and start-up investments that are \nalready underway, but it would also impede supervision, limit the Bureau's consumer response \nservices, prevent the ramping up of citizen financial literacy improvements, and delay the \nimplementation of financial protection programs for older Americans.  \n \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Administration opposes the funding level for the \nSEC, which would compromise the Commission's current market oversight and enforcement \nactivities, including policing the securities and derivatives marketplace; undermine the SEC's ability \nto effectively carry out responsibilities authorized under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act; and severely compromise critical information technology investments \nthat would prevent fraudulent investment schemes.  Limiting SEC's expenditures does not result in \nany budgetary savings, since SEC is fully funded by fees on financial transactions and the overall \nfee level is by statute set to equal the spending level appropriated.  In addition, section 623 of the \nbill, which bars the SEC from using amounts in its Reserve Fund as authorized by the Dodd-Frank \nAct, is problematic because it would significantly undermine SEC's ability to fund long-term \nprojects that improve the Commission's efficiency and effectiveness.  \n \nElection Assistance Commission (EAC).  The bill would limit EAC's activities to protect the \nintegrity of elections and undermine the agency's role as part of the Nation's election system \ninfrastructure.  Not only would the level of resources provided in the bill require a 50-percent \nreduction in staff, it would also limit the agency's ability to perform its statutorily required duties, \nincluding the certification of voting systems and the maintenance of a clearinghouse of election \nadministration information.   \n \nFederal Communications Commission (FCC).  The funding level for FCC would make it \nincreasingly difficult to manage its expanded responsibilities, such as auctioning additional \nspectrum, overseeing mergers, and reforming the Universal Service Fund.  Because FCC is fully \nfunded by fees, this reduction would not save taxpayer dollars. \n \nNational Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  The bill provides inadequate funding for \nNARA to effectively perform its core operations, including providing Federal agencies and the \npublic with access to Federal Government records in paper, electronic, and other forms. \n \n \n \n2  Executive Office of the President (EOP) \n \nEOP Funding.  The level of resources provided in the bill would significantly impact the EOP's role \nin assisting the President in carrying out his constitutional duties as head of the Executive Branch, \nincluding protecting national security interests, developing policies to address the challenges facing \nthe Nation, reducing the deficit and spending taxpayer dollars more cost-effectively, and managing \nthe Federal agencies.  \n \nGeneral Services Administration (GSA) \n \nFederal Buildings Fund.  The bill provides insufficient resources to operate the existing GSA \nbuildings portfolio, including lease payments to private lessors, utility payments, and janitorial \nservices.  The bill also provides no resources for high priority capital projects including several \nmodernization projects that would increase efficiency and reduce costs. \n \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) \n \nOPM's New Statutory Responsibilities.  The funding level provided by the bill would limit OPM's \nability to implement and administer new statutory responsibilities.  \n \nThe bill includes the following problematic policy and language issues that are beyond the scope of \nfunding legislation:  \n \nDepartment of the Treasury.  The Administration opposes sections 107 and 108 of the bill, which \nwould place significant restrictions on the Department's ability to adequately implement the \nAffordable Care Act, and would delay the planning and construction of a system to administer the \ncritical premium assistance tax credit and the ability to reconcile it with IRS's core systems.  These \nsections would prevent both appropriated and transferred funds from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services from being used by the Department to administer the law. \n \nOffice of Financial Stability (OFS).  Section 127 of the bill would set an unprecedented limit on \nappropriated expenditure by OFS, which would severely limit OFS's ability to effectively and \nefficiently administer the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), including protecting taxpayer \ninvestments held by TARP and providing housing program support. \n \nHome Affordable Modification Program (HAMP).  Section 129 of the bill would terminate HAMP \nand thereby increase the number of avoidable foreclosures, as many struggling homeowners would \nno longer have an opportunity to reduce their mortgage payments to a sustainable level through the \nprogram.  HAMP has greatly contributed to standardizing the treatment of millions of delinquent \nhome loans, bringing greater certainty to struggling homeowners.  It is a key tool to stabilizing the \nhousing market by preventing avoidable foreclosures, protecting home values, and preserving \nhomeownership. \n \nPresidential Election Campaign Fund.  Section 620 of the bill would effectively terminate the \nNation's Presidential election public financing system, expanding the power of corporations and \nspecial interests in the Nation's elections.  This language would force many candidates into an \nendless cycle of fundraising at the expense of engagement with voters on the issues, and would \nplace a premium on access to large donor or special interest support, narrowing the field of \notherwise worthy candidates.  \n \n3  Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  Section 621 of the bill would prohibit the FCC from \npromoting open Internet practices that prevent unnecessary discrimination across content carried by \nInternet service providers.  The FCC has carefully crafted rules to promote competition while \nbalancing the technical needs of Internet providers. \n \nDistrict of Columbia Needle Exchange Restriction.  Section 807 of the bill restricts the use of \nFederal funds for the District's needle exchange programs.  This is contrary to current practice and \nthe Administration\u2019s policy to allow funds to be used in locations where local authorities deem \nneedle exchange programs to be effective and appropriate. \n \nDistrict of Columbia Abortion Restriction.  Section 810 of the bill prevents the District of Columbia \nfrom using its own funds for abortions, which undermines the principle of states' rights and of D.C. \nhome rule.  Longstanding Federal policy already prohibits Federal funds from being used for \nabortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered. \n \nConsumer Product Safety Commission's (CPSC's) Product Safety Database.  Section 622 of the bill \nprohibits the use of funds for CPSC's public product safety database, SaferProducts.gov.  This \nwebsite allows the public to submit and review reports of harm or risk of harm related to the use of \nconsumer products, and it also allows manufacturers to respond directly to each report. The funding \nrestriction, which will eliminate the database, is inconsistent with the Administration's transparency \ngoals, limiting the information available to consumers and manufacturers about hazardous or \npotentially hazardous products.  \n \nFighting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.  The Administration is concerned with sections 740 and 741 of \nthe bill and looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve the intended purpose of \nprotecting the interest of the Nation's taxpayers, which is consistent with the Administration's \nefforts to fight fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal contracts, grants, and other Federal assistance. \n \nCuban Family Travel and Remittances.  The Administration opposes section 901 of the bill, which \nwould reverse the President's policy on family travel and remittances to Cuba.  This section would \nundo the President's efforts to increase contact between divided Cuban families, undermine the \nenhancement of the Cuban people's economic independence and support for private sector activity \nin Cuba that come from increased remittances from family members, and therefore isolate the \nCuban people and make them more dependent on Cuban authorities. \n \nConstitutional Concerns.  Multiple provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  Section 203 \nwould prohibit the use of funds for officers or employees of the Executive Office of the President \n\"to prepare, sign, or approve statements abrogating legislation passed by the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate and signed by the President.\"  Contrary to the implication of section \n203, Presidential signing statements do not abrogate legislation.  They indicate how the Executive \nBranch will apply acts of the Congress to ensure faithful execution of the laws.  To the extent \nsection 203 purports to prevent the President from making use of his immediate aides in the \nExecutive Office of the President to prepare any statement articulating the conclusion that a \nparticular provision of law is unconstitutional and therefore will not be executed, in whole or in \npart, this provision would impermissibly encroach upon the President's constitutional authority to \nexecute and interpret Federal laws, including the Constitution.  Section 632 would prohibit the use \nof funds for several positions that involve providing advice directly to the President. It also would \ndeny funding for any \"substantially similar positions.\"  As the President indicated in an April 15, \n2011 statement regarding virtually identical provisions in prior legislation, the President has well-\nestablished authority to supervise and oversee the Executive Branch, and to obtain advice in \n4  furtherance of this supervisory authority.  The President also has the prerogative to obtain advice \nthat will assist him in carrying out his constitutional responsibilities, and do so not only from \nExecutive Branch officials and employees outside the White House, but also from advisors within \nit.  Finally, Section 713 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive \nBranch to disclose, without discretion, certain classified and other privileged information, in which \ncase it would intrude on the President's discharge of his constitutional authorities.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations process moves forward to ensure the Administration can support enactment of the \nlegislation. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n5  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \nMay 31, 2012 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5325 \u2013 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2013 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5325, making appropriations for \nenergy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, \n2013, and for other purposes.   \n \nLast summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on a \nsustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  The BCA created a \nframework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that would \nbring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national priorities.  \nDeparting from the bipartisan agreement reached in the BCA and departing from these caps, the \nHouse of Representatives put forward a topline discretionary funding level for FY 2013 that, for \nexample, would cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially seniors, veterans, and children \u2013 \nas well as degrade many of the basic Government services on which the American people rely, such \nas air traffic control and law enforcement.  In addition, these cuts were made in the context of a \nbudget that fails the test of balance, fairness, and shared responsibility by giving millionaires and \nbillionaires a tax cut and paying for it through deep cuts, including to discretionary programs. \n \nTaking this into account, passing H.R. 5325 at its current funding level would mean that when the \nCongress constructs other appropriations bills, it would necessitate significant and harmful cuts to \ncritical national priorities such as education, research and development, job training, and health \ncare.  Furthermore, this bill undermines key investments in clean energy and scientific research and \ndevelopment, building blocks of our Nation's future economy.  Investing in these areas is critical to \nthe Nation's economic growth, security, and global competitiveness.  The Administration also \nstrongly objects to the inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of \nfunding legislation.  \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5325, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) \n \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA\u2013E).  The Administration strongly opposes the  reduction in funding for ARPA\u2013E.  The bill provides $200 million for the program, which is $150 \nmillion below the FY 2013 Budget request and $75 million below the FY 2012 enacted level.  \nARPA\u2013E funds early stage, transformative energy technology research that industry, by itself, is \nunlikely to support.  Investments in ARPA\u2013E are aimed at ensuring that the Nation remains at the \nforefront of new energy technology development to ensure the United States remains a lead \ncompetitor in this area. \n \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  The Administration strongly opposes \nthe level of funding provided for EERE, which is $886 million below the FY 2013 Budget request \nand $428 million less than the FY 2012 enacted level. The current funding in the bill would be the \nlowest level of funding for EERE since FY 2006, leaving U.S. competitiveness at risk in new \nmarkets and clean energy industries such as advanced vehicles, advanced manufacturing, energy \nefficiency for homes and businesses, and domestic renewable energy such as wind, solar, and \nbiomass.  This level cuts funding for solar energy and for building energy efficiency nearly in half \nfrom the FY 2012 enacted level. \n \nOffice of Science.  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding in the bill for the \nOffice of Science, which is $191 million below the FY 2013 Budget request and $73 million below \nthe FY 2012 enacted level. The funding provided would hinder important research underpinning \nU.S. innovation in clean energy technologies and applications.  The Office of Science also funds \nbasic research across a broad spectrum of physical, biological, and environmental sciences.  \nReductions in support for these areas may lead to a loss of U.S. leadership in many areas of science.  \n \nEnergy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration urges the House to fully fund EIA, \nwhich will allow the agency to continue to provide independent and rigorous analysis of America's \nenergy markets, including important national energy consumption and production data.  This level \nis also necessary to improve the security of procedures and data delivery methods for reports, such \nas weekly oil stock reports, that can move market prices. The bill currently provides $100 million, \nwhich is $16 million below the FY 2013 Budget request and $5 million less than the FY 2012 \nenacted level. \n \nNational Nuclear Security Administration.  The Administration greatly appreciates the Committee's \nsupport for Presidential initiatives to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and to maintain a robust \ndeterrent.  This support will help continue efforts to secure nuclear materials in four years, maintain \na safe, secure, and effective nuclear stockpile through stockpile stewardship and life extensions, \nrecapitalize the aging infrastructure of the nuclear enterprise, and develop a reactor for the Ohio \nClass replacement submarine. \n \nStatutory by Reference Provision.  The Administration urges the House to remove section 301(c) of \nthe bill, which incorporates the text as well as the specific funding directions of the House report \ninto the statute by reference.  There are multiple provisions in the report language that could be \nproblematic or otherwise counter to the specific activities laid out in the FY 2013 Budget.  In \naddition, enactment of this provision would limit flexibility and efficiency in execution.  \n \nArmy Corps of Engineers (Corps) \n \nOverall Funding and New Starts.  The Administration urges the House to reduce the overall level of \n2  funding to that requested in the FY 2013 Budget, and to reallocate funds to restore funding \nrequested for several priority programs and initiatives.  These priority programs include the start of \nconstruction work on an important new program to reverse damage to the coastal Louisiana \necosystem and other priority new construction starts; a study requested by the Congress to examine \nflood risks nationwide to improve existing programs; and the restoration of $15 million to the \nCorps' regulatory program, so it can process permit applications in a timely manner. \n \nInland Waterways.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued strong support for \ncost-sharing of inland waterways capital investments.  The Administration also urges the House to \ninclude the general provision proposed in the FY 2013 Budget to increase the total authorized cost \nfor the Olmsted Locks and Dam project. \n \nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation \n \nSan Joaquin River Restoration.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's elimination \nof funding for this program, which would undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's \ngoals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts. \n \nPolicy Riders \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders including, but not \nlimited to, the following provisions in this bill: \n \nYucca Mountain.  Section 508 of the bill would prohibit using funds made available by the bill for \nany actions related to the Administration's plan for Yucca Mountain, such as closing the application \nprocess. \n \nDOE Weatherization Assistance Program.  Section 307 of the bill permanently blocks existing \nWeatherization Assistance Program authorizations, reducing the efficiency of the program by \nlowering the maximum income level for retrofit assistance eligibility, the maximum financial \nassistance per weatherized home, and the maximum allocation allowed for Training and Technical \nAssistance from current levels. \n \nFossil-fuel generated energy consumption reduction.  Section 311 would prevent funding for the \ndevelopment and implementation of a rule to improve energy efficiency and reduce reliance on \nfossil fuels in Federal buildings, and would hinder the Administration's ability to improve the \nefficiency of Federal buildings and reduce harmful greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions. \n \nClean Water Act (CWA).  Section 110 of the bill would stop an Administration effort to provide \nclarity on which water bodies are covered by CWA.  The existing regulations were the subject of \ntwo Supreme Court cases in 2001 and 2006, in which the Court indicated the need for greater \nregulatory clarity on the scope of CWA jurisdiction. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations \nprocess moves forward.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \nMay 17, 2012 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 3187 \u2013 Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act \n(Sen.

The biosimilar approval pathway was created by the Affordable Care \nAct, and the generic drug user fee program was proposed in the 2013 President's Budget to help \nincrease patient access to affordable medicines.   \n \nS. 3187 also enhances the tools available to the Food and Drug Administration to address drug \nshortages by requiring additional early notification of potential shortages, an action the \nAdministration called for in the 2011 Executive Order on drug shortages.

Increasing the Federal debt limit, which is needed to avoid a Federal government \ndefault on its obligations and a severe blow to the economy, should not be conditioned on taking \nthese actions.  Instead of pursuing an empty political statement and unrealistic policy goals, it is \nnecessary to move beyond politics as usual and find bipartisan common ground. \n \nThe bill would undercut the Federal Government\u2019s ability to meet its core commitments to seniors, \nmiddle-class families and the most vulnerable, while reducing our ability to invest in our future.  H. \nR. 2560 would set unrealistic spending caps that could result in significant cuts to education, \nresearch and development, and other programs critical to growing our economy and winning the \nfuture.  It could also lead to severe cuts in Medicare and Social Security, which are growing to \naccommodate the retirement of the baby boomers, and put at risk the retirement security for tens of \nmillions of Americans. \n \nFurthermore, H. R. 2560 could require even deeper cuts, since it conditions an increase in the \nFederal debt limit on Congressional passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment.  H. R. 2560 sets out \na false and unacceptable choice between the Federal Government defaulting on its obligations now \nor, alternatively, passing a Balanced Budget Amendment that, in the years ahead, will likely leave \nthe Nation unable to meet its core commitment of ensuring dignity in retirement. \n \nThe President has proposed a comprehensive and balanced framework that ensures we live within \nour means and reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, while supporting economic growth and long-term \njob creation, protecting critical investments, and meeting the commitments made to provide \neconomic security to Americans no matter their circumstances.  H.R. 2560 is inconsistent with this \nresponsible framework to restore fiscal responsibility and is not an appropriate method of reducing \nthe Nation\u2019s deficits and debt.

On July 1st, absent \nCongressional action that the Administration can support, the interest rate on new subsidized \nFederal Direct Stafford Loans for undergraduate students is set to double, from 3.4 percent to 6.8 \npercent.

Hastings, R-WA, and 70 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas \nproduction as part of a broad energy strategy that will protect consumers and reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.  Safety and environmental reforms that the Administration \nimplemented in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill are critical to achieving those \nobjectives.  These reforms strengthen requirements for issues ranging from well design to \nworkplace safety to corporate accountability, and they require operators to show that they can \ncontain a subsea oil spill like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The Administration opposes         \nH.R. 1230 and H.R. 1229, as reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources, both of \nwhich would undercut these critical reforms.  \n \nH.R. 1230 would undermine the Administration's work to ensure that environmental analysis \nrequired by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is conducted in a rigorous manner.  \nH.R. 1230 would hastily open areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic to leasing, including \nrequiring the Department of the Interior (DOI) to hold three lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico \nusing outdated NEPA analysis that was conducted before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The \nAdministration has strengthened NEPA analysis in light of lessons learned from the spill.  DOI \nintends to hold all three Gulf of Mexico lease sales referenced in the bill by mid-2012.     \n \nH.R. 1229 would constrain the ability of DOI to ensure that permits meet safety standards by \nrequiring permitting decisions to be made within 30 days of receiving an application \u2013 thereby \ncurtailing the review period.  Two 15 day extensions would be possible, though DOI would be \nrequired to submit burdensome justifications.  The bill would grant permits automatically at the \nend of this 60 day window, regardless of whether the applicant satisfied safety standards.  The \nAdministration believes these statutory time constraints are unwarranted.  Fifty-one new shallow \nwater permits have been issued since the Administration\u2019s stronger safety standards were put in \nplace, and deepwater permit applications also are being processed in a timely manner.  Since the \nend of February, when industry first demonstrated to safety regulators the capability to contain a \nsubsea spill, twelve deepwater wells have been permitted. \n \nH.R. 1229 would also require the Secretary of the Interior to grant an automatic one-year \nsuspension of leases (effectively extending the term of the lease) in the Gulf of Mexico.  The \nAdministration fully supports suspensions for Gulf of Mexico leaseholders directly impacted by \nthe drilling moratorium.  Ten such suspensions have already been granted using administrative \nprocedures to leaseholders who demonstrated that they were affected by the moratoria. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \nMay 15, 2012 \n \n(House Rules)\nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \n  H.R. 4310 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013 \n  (Rep. McKeon, R-CA, and 1 cosponsor) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee's continued support of our \nnational defense and supports a number of the provisions in H.R. 4310, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.  In particular, the Administration appreciates the support of \nthe Committee for authorities that assist the ability of the warfighter to operate in unconventional \nand irregular warfare, counter unconventional threats, or support contingency or stability \noperations.  The Administration is disappointed, however, with the many provisions in this bill that \nimpede the ability of the Secretary of Defense to carry out the 2012 defense strategic guidance.  \n \nWhile there are a number of areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration has serious \nconcerns with provisions that:  (1) depart from the President's fiscal year (FY) 2013 Budget request \n\u2013 in particular, increases to the topline request for the base budget; (2) constrain the ability of the \nArmed Forces to carry out their missions consistent with the new defense strategy; or (3) impede \nthe ability of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy to make and implement \nmanagement decisions that eliminate unnecessary overhead or programs to ensure scarce resources \nare directed to the highest priorities for the national security.  The overall funding level supported \nby H.R. 4310 would violate the Budget Control Act of 2011, the bipartisan agreement reached \nbetween the Congress and the President to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal course.  If the \ncumulative effects of the bill impede the ability of the Administration to execute the new defense \nstrategy and to properly direct scarce resources, the President's senior advisors would recommend to \nthe President that he veto the bill.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.  As well, the Administration looks \nforward to reviewing a classified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns on \nclassified programs. \n \nLimitations on Nuclear Force Reductions and Nuclear Employment Strategy:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to sections 1053-1059, which would impinge on the President's ability to \nimplement the New START Treaty and to set U.S. nuclear weapons policy.  In particular, sections \n1053 and 1055 would set onerous conditions on the Administration's ability to implement the \nTreaty, and section 1058 would set onerous conditions on the President's ability to retire, dismantle, \nor eliminate non-deployed nuclear weapons.  Further, section 1054 raises constitutional concerns as \nit appears to encroach on the President's authority as Commander in Chief to set nuclear \nemployment policy \u2013 a right exercised by every president in the nuclear age from both parties.  If \nthe final bill presented to the President includes these provisions, the President's senior advisors \nwould recommend that he veto the bill. \n \nDetainee Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1035-1043, which would  continue and in some cases expand unwise restrictions that would constrain the flexibility that our \nNation's armed forces and counterterrorism professionals need to deal with evolving \nthreats.  Section 1035, which would prohibit any detainee who has been repatriated to Micronesia, \nthe Marshall Islands, or the Republic of Palau from traveling to the U.S., is unnecessary and could \nundermine our relations with a friendly government whose citizens may serve in the U.S. \nmilitary.  Sections 1036, 1037, 1038, and 1043 unnecessarily renew, supplement, or enhance the \nrestrictions on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States or a foreign \ncountry.  The Administration continues to strongly oppose these provisions, which intrude upon the \nExecutive branch\u2019s ability to carry out its military, national security, and foreign relations activities \nand to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees.  Likewise, the \nAdministration opposes the notice and reporting requirements in sections 1040, 1041, and 1042, \nwhich would unnecessarily complicate and potentially compromise military operations and \ndetention practices \u2013 including aboard naval vessels at sea.  These sections, like section 1039, \nwould also greatly add to the military\u2019s administrative burden.  Section 1041 is an unprecedented, \nunwarranted, and misguided intrusion into the military\u2019s detention operations in a foreign combat \ntheater during an active armed conflict.  The reporting requirements seek to micromanage the \ndecisions of experienced military commanders and diplomats, threaten to compromise the \nExecutive\u2019s ability to act swiftly and flexibly during a critical time for transition in Afghanistan, \nand could deter or jeopardize the success of effective foreign prosecutions.  Sections 1036, 1037, \nand 1041, moreover, would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers \nprinciples.  If the final bill presented to the President includes provisions that challenge critical \nexecutive branch authority, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  \n \nTRICARE Fees and Co-Payments:  The Administration agrees that retirees deserve a quality health \ncare benefit.  For this very reason, the Administration strongly supports its requested TRICARE fee \ninitiatives that seek to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense (DOD) \nwhile keeping retired beneficiaries' share of these costs well below the levels experienced when the \nTRICARE program was implemented in the mid-1990s.  The projected FY 2013 TRICARE savings \nof $1.8 billion and $12.9 billion through FY 2017 are essential for DOD to successfully address \nrising personnel costs.  DOD needs these savings to balance and maintain investments for key \ndefense priorities.  The Administration is very disappointed that the Committee did not support the \nproposed TRICARE fee increases and included section 718, which, while supporting some fee \nincreases, caps them at levels below those allowed under current law and below the requested \nauthorization.  If section 718 remains in the bill, it would only provide five year savings of $2.6 \nbillion. \n \nLimitations on Retirement of Weapon Systems:  The Administration strongly objects to provisions \nthat would restrict retirements of C-27J, C-23, C-130, and other aircraft and the RQ-4 Global Hawk \nBlock 30.  These provisions would force DOD to operate, sustain, and maintain aircraft that are in \nexcess of national requirements and are not affordable in an austere budget environment.  Retaining \nlarge numbers of under-resourced aircraft in the fleet in today's fiscally constrained environment \nwould significantly increase the risk of a hollow force.  The Administration also objects to \nprovisions that would restrict retirements of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines and \ncertain Ticonderoga Class Cruisers (CGs) and Dock Landing Ships (LSDs).  The requirement to \nmaintain a minimum of 12 ballistic missile submarines in the fleet would limit the Secretary of the \nNavy's ability to manage Naval strategic forces to balance risk across the total Naval battle force, \nand to ensure scarce resources are directed to the highest priorities of the Combatant Commanders.  \nThe requirement to retain CGs and LSDs without associated funding for manning, repair, \nmaintenance, and modernization over the remainder of their service lives places the Navy at greater \n2  risk of hollowing out the fleet.  Finally, the Administration objects to section 1076, which would \nprevent the retirement of the C-23 aircraft in FY 2013.  As of January 27, 2012, when the Army \ntransferred the mission to conduct time sensitive/mission critical cargo and personnel to the Air \nForce, the Army no longer has a mission for a fixed wing cargo aircraft.  Delaying the divestment of \nthe C-23 aircraft into FY 2016 and beyond would cost $343.5 million for modernization and service \nlife extension on the aircraft.  In the current constrained budget environment, a congressional \nrequirement to maintain systems that are outside the scope of the Nation's security requirements is \nirresponsible. \n \nLimitations on End-Strength Reductions for the Army and Marine Corps:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 403, which would limit active duty end-strength reductions for the Army \nand Marine Corps in FYs 2014-2017 to 15,000 and 5,000 per year, respectively, and would require \nDOD to fund all Army and Marine Corps active duty end strength in the base budget and not \nthrough emergency, supplemental, or overseas contingency operations (OCO) funds.  The timing \nand pace of the planned reductions to the Army and Marine Corps are tied to anticipated changes in \noperational demand based on the Nation's current commitments as well as the new defense strategy, \nwhich emphasizes a smaller and leaner force.  Limiting the Army's budgeted end-strength \nreductions to 15,000 per year is estimated to increase military personnel and health care costs by \nover $500 million in FY 2014 and $1.9 billion through FY 2017.  Where non-enduring end strength \nabove 490,000 for the Army and 182,100 for the Marine Corps is maintained between FY 2014 and \nFY 2017, it is because of current contingency operations and, therefore, appropriately funded in the \nOCO portion of the DOD budget request.  The Administration also strongly opposes provisions \nmandating an end strength for the Army at 552,000 in FY 2013 and excluding Service members in \nthe Integrated Disability Evaluation Systems from FY 2013 active duty end-strength authorized \nlevels.  To comply with this legislation, the Army would need to significantly increase accessions \nand retention far beyond what is currently planned to meet the minimum end strength.  \n \nBase Realignment and Closure (BRAC):  The Administration strongly objects to section 2713, \nwhich would prohibit DOD from spending any funds to propose or plan for additional rounds of \nBRAC, and sections 2712, 2867, and 2868, which seek to freeze certain Air Force command \nstructures, capabilities, and functions as they existed in  2011.  Together, these sections appear to \nimpinge on Executive branch prerogatives to plan for contingencies or make other needed \nadjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration is \nconcerned that the House has not authorized additional BRAC rounds so that DOD may properly \nalign the military's infrastructure with the needs of our evolving force structure, which is critical to \nensuring that limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and the \nnational security.  \n \nProtection of Certain Religious and Moral Beliefs:  The Administration strongly objects to sections \n536 and 537 because those provisions adopt unnecessary and ill-advised policies that would inhibit \nthe ability of same-sex couples to marry or enter a recognized relationship under State law.  Section \n536 would prohibit all personnel-related actions based on certain religious and moral beliefs, which, \nin its overbroad terms, is potentially harmful to good order and discipline.  Section 537 would \nobligate DOD to deny Service members, retirees, and their family members access to facilities for \nreligious ceremonies on the basis of sexual orientation, a troublesome and potentially \nunconstitutional limitation on religious liberty.  \n \nMissile Defense:  The Administration appreciates the support for DOD's air and missile defense \nprograms, as well as the support for the Government of Israel to purchase additional Iron Dome \n3  missile systems.  However, the Administration strongly objects to sections 223, 230, 1236, 2204(b), \nand 2403(b), as well as the Committee's $75 million reduction to the authorization of appropriation \nin section 4601 for the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System Complex, respectively.  These \nprovisions would jeopardize the implementation of the European Phased Adaptive Approach \n(EPAA) to missile defense and limit the ability to protect the United States, deployed U.S. Forces, \nallies, and partners.  Section 223, which would require a missile defense site on the East Coast of \nthe United States, is premature because the Administration has not identified a requirement for a \nthird U.S.-based missile defense site, nor assessed the feasibility or cost in a cost-constrained \nenvironment.  This section also would mandate the inclusion of a plan to deploy an appropriate \nmissile defense interceptor for such a site in the budget request for FY 2014, an unwarranted \nintrusion on Executive branch decision making.  Sections 230, 2204(b), and 2403(b) would limit \nfunding for missile defense equipment and construction supporting the EPAA \u2013 the U.S. voluntary \nnational contribution to NATO missile defense \u2013 thereby hindering its implementation and limiting \nprotection of U.S. Forces, allies, and partners in NATO Europe.  Finally, section 1236 would \nunnecessarily impede the President's exclusive authority to conduct discussions with the Russian \nFederation on cooperative missile defense matters both bilaterally and in the NATO context, would \nlimit the reciprocal exchange of data that could benefit U.S. and allied security, and would be \nimpractical to implement. \n \nMedium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS):  The Administration strongly objects to section \n229, which would prohibit the use of funds for the MEADS program.  If the Congress does not \nappropriate FY 2013 funding, there is a high likelihood that this action would be perceived by our \npartners Italy and Germany as breaking our commitment under the Memorandum of Understanding, \nand could harm our relationship with our Allies on a much broader basis, including future \nmultinational cooperative projects.  It also could prevent the completion of the agreed Proof of \nConcept activities, which would provide data archiving, analysis of testing, and software \ndevelopment necessary to harvest technology from U.S. and partner investments in MEADS. \n \nExtended Deterrent in Europe:  The Administration strongly objects, including on constitutional \ngrounds, to the elements of section 1060 that would limit the President\u2019s ability to determine U.S. \nmilitary requirements in Europe, negotiate treaties and otherwise conduct diplomacy, and maintain \nthe confidentiality of sensitive diplomatic communications.  This section would inhibit our ability to \nfunction within NATO.  The Administration also objects to this section\u2019s limitation on \nAdministration efforts to address tactical (non-strategic) nuclear weapons, a step called for in the \nSenate's Resolution of Ratification of the New START Treaty and a priority of U.S. arms control \npolicy.  \n \nMilitary Operations:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1221 and 1222, which would \nrequire DOD to prepare and submit a plan to augment the presence of the U.S. Fifth Fleet in the \nMiddle East and to conduct military activities in that region.  Taken together, these provisions \nwould infringe upon the President's prerogative to plan for military activities, including the \ndeployment of U.S. Forces.  Section 1221 also purports to declare U.S. policy toward Iran, \nchallenging the President's well-established constitutional prerogatives with respect to U.S. foreign \npolicy.  The Administration also objects to section 1222, which would micromanage the President's \ndecisions as Commander-in-Chief regarding the deployment of U.S. Forces. \n \nMilitary Activities in Cyberspace:  The Administration agrees that appropriate military operations \nin cyberspace are a vital component of national security, but objects to section 941, which seeks to \nclarify military authority to conduct clandestine cyber operations.  The Administration has concerns \n4  about this provision and wants to work with the Congress to ensure that any such legislation adds \nclarity and value to our efforts in cyberspace. \n \nProhibition on Use of Funds to Implement International Agreement on Space Activities that Have \nNot Been Ratified by the Senate or Authorized by Statute:  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 913, which prohibits the expenditure of funds by the Secretary of Defense or the Director of \nNational Intelligence to implement or comply with an international agreement concerning outer \nspace activities unless such agreement is ratified by the Senate or authorized by statute.  The \nAdministration is participating in the development of a non-legally binding International Code of \nConduct for Outer Space Activities (Code), which is not an international agreement concerning \nouter space activities.  The Code would not impose any legal obligations on the United States, nor \nwould it restrict the exercise of the U.S.'s rights of individual and collective self-defense.  Instead, it \nwould enhance U.S. national security by encouraging responsible space behavior and singling out \nthose who act otherwise, reducing the risk of misunderstanding and misconduct in space.  The \nAdministration is concerned that this provision would create confusion about the legal status of the \nCode and lead our international partners to conclude that the U.S. will treat the Code as an \ninternational agreement, greatly complicating negotiations.  Furthermore, section 913 encroaches on \nthe Executive's exclusive authority to conduct foreign relations and could severely hamper U.S. \nability to conduct bilateral space cooperation activities with key allies.   \n \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) and Contractor Management Relationships:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to elements of sections 1061 and 1062 and certain provisions of Title 31 that \nchange the responsibilities, authorities, and reporting requirements between and among DOE, the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), contractors managing and operating the national \nlaboratories, the President, and the Congress.  Some of these changes fundamentally alter the \nrelationship between DOE and NNSA by restricting the authority of the Secretary of Energy and \ntransferring responsibilities from DOE to NNSA.  The bill also:  (1) legislates the establishment of a \ncouncil of the national laboratory contractors with the authority to make unrestricted \nrecommendations to NNSA, which then mandate a response by NNSA; (2) takes authority for final \napproval of the NNSA budget submission away from the President;  (3) requires NNSA to submit a \ncost-benefit analysis to the Congress before competing a management and operating contract, which \nwould undermine a long-standing and bipartisan effort to increase competition in government \ncontracting; and (4) authorizes unrestricted access for the contractors to report to the Congress on \nAdministration activities. \n \nHealth and Safety at DOE and NNSA:  The Administration strongly opposes sections 3202, 3115, \n3113, and 3151.  These provisions severely hamper external, independent oversight by the Defense \nNuclear Facilities Safety Board; move regulatory authority from independent offices and agencies \nto the NNSA Administrator; require a weaker standard of contractor governance, management, and \noversight; and eliminate DOE's flexibility to determine the appropriate means of assessing the \nunique risks that it confronts in its facilities.  By lowering safety standards for the nuclear weapons \ncomplex and reducing requested funding for health, safety, and security, these provisions would \nweaken protections for workers and the general public.   \n \nNNSA Staffing:  Section 3111 would direct the Administration to make large reductions within the \nNNSA in its number of Federal employees.  The NNSA is undertaking major, complex efforts to \nmove to a more efficient and effective management of the nuclear security complex while \nmaintaining the safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear arsenal.  The Administration \nbelieves that the NNSA is best positioned to prescribe the proper level of staffing to fulfill those \n5  missions effectively within the budget appropriated by the Congress. \n \nUnwarranted Disclosure of Internal Executive Branch Information:  The Administration objects to \nsection 953, which would require DOD to provide to the Congress the Administration's internal \nplanning and guidance information, and section 1077, which could be construed to interfere with \nDOD's ability to control the release of information related to internal deliberations on matters such \nas budget and program decisions and treaty negotiations. \n \nIncremental Funding:  The bill would provide incremental funding for major programs rather than \nthe full funding and advance appropriations that the Administration requested.  Although the \nAdministration supports the underlying programs, the Administration strongly opposes the use of \nincremental funding for the VIRGINIA class attack submarine and the Space-Based Infrared \nSystem satellites because incremental funding undermines program stability and cost discipline.   \n \nUnified Medical Command:  The Administration strongly objects to section 711, which would \nrequire the President to create a new unified combatant command for medical operations of the \nmilitary health system.  DOD completed a study on how to best deliver high-quality medical care to \nService members and their families in an effective and cost-efficient manner.  The study, submitted \nto the Congress, was reviewed in detail by the most senior civilian and military leaders of the \nDepartment, who determined that a Unified Medical Command was not the proper course of action \nfor DOD.  Section 711 would preclude DOD from properly structuring itself to accomplish the most \nefficient and effective improvement to the current Military Health System.  The Administration also \nobjects to section 719, which would require DOD to implement as-yet-unknown recommendations \nfrom a report by the U.S. Comptroller General prior to making changes to the structure of the \nMilitary Health System. \n \nRequirements to Develop or Maintain Unnecessary Capabilities:  The Administration objects to \nsection 352, which would require the Secretary of the Air Force to maintain operational capabilities \nat 18 aerospace control alert sites.  After an extensive analysis, DOD determined that it was possible \nto reduce the routine aerospace control alert posture at two sites without exposing the United States \nto undue risk based on the current threat.  The Administration also objects to section 211, which \nwould require the Long Range Strike Bomber to be certified to use strategic nuclear weapons as a \nprecondition for declaring initial operational capability (IOC).  This requirement would \nunnecessarily delay conventional weapons IOC.   \n \nLimitation on Reimbursement of the Government of Pakistan:  The Administration strongly objects \nto the restriction in reimbursement for Pakistan from Coalition Support Funds and the associated \ncertification requirements in section 1211.  Taken together, the reimbursement restriction and the \ncertification restrictions - some of which require the Secretary of Defense to certify Pakistani \ncooperation on issues outside of his purview - are proposed at a particularly sensitive time and \nwould severely constrict DOD's ability to respond to emergent war-time coalition support \nrequirements, putting at risk the success of our campaign in Afghanistan, and increasing the risk \nthat al-Qaida and its associates would be able to again enjoy a safe haven in Pakistan. \n \nUse of Private Security Contractors:  The Administration understands the aims of the provision, but \nstrongly objects to section 1214, which would limit the Secretary of Defense's options to provide \nsecurity for members of the Armed Forces and military installations and facilities in Afghanistan \nand would undermine the coalition's efforts to encourage Afghan assumption of sovereign duties.  If \nenacted, this section will require either additional troops to perform security functions or a reduction \n6  in combat missions that current force levels perform.  It could also undermine civilian-military \ncoordination and increase risk for certain development projects that are critical to ensuring a stable \nAfghanistan through the transition period to 2014. \n \nExtension and Expansion of Authority to Acquire Products and Services Produced in Countries \nAlong a Major Route of Supply to Afghanistan:  The Administration objects to language included in \nsection 821, which would limit the use of expanded procurement authority to only those Northern \nDistribution Network (NDN) countries that agree to permit the transport of coalition personnel, \nequipment, and supplies.  This restriction would hamper DOD's attempts at local procurement along \nthe NDN and would impact transit agreements that the United States already has negotiated with \nseveral countries along the NDN. \n \nAlternative Fuels:  The Administration objects to sections 313 and 314, which would affect DOD's \nability to procure alternative fuels and would further increase American reliance on fossil fuels, \nthereby contributing to geopolitical instability and endangering our interests abroad.   \n \nAbrams/Bradley Upgrades:  The Administration objects to $321 million of unrequested \nauthorization in section 4101, lines 005 and 012 for unneeded upgrades to the M-1 Abrams tank and \nM-2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles in a fiscally-constrained environment.  \n \nPurple Hearts for Fort Hood and Little Rock Victims:  The Administration objects to section 552, \nwhich would grant Purple Hearts to the victims of the shooting incidents in Fort Hood, Texas, and \nLittle Rock, Arkansas.  The criminal acts that occurred in Little Rock were tried by the State of \nArkansas as violations of the State criminal code rather than as acts of terrorism; as a result, this \nprovision could create appellate issues. \n \nVeterans Memorial Object Transfer:  The Administration objects to section 355, which would \nprohibit the return of veterans' memorial objects without specific authorization in law.  This \nprovision would restrict the President's ability to take actions to demonstrate goodwill toward \nforeign allies and partners by lending or giving historical artifacts in instances where doing so \nwould serve the national security interests of the United States. \n \nRetroactive Liability for Closed Non-BRAC DOD Installations:  The Administration objects to \nsection 2813, which would mandate DOD to indemnify anyone who acquired ownership or control \nof DOD property at any military installation closed outside the BRAC process after October 24, \n1988 against costs or claims arising from environmental conditions.  The provision would \nretroactively expose DOD to new and costly claims and undermine the equity to the United States \nof the terms and conditions negotiated in good faith with purchasers when the property was \noriginally conveyed.  Property transferees are already protected by the deed covenants DOD is \nrequired to provide under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \nLiability Act. \n \nNational Guard Center of Excellence:  The Administration opposes section 334, which would create \na Center of Excellence (COE) for the National Guard State Partnership Program to provide training \nto units and members of the active and reserve components to implement the State Partnership \nProgram.  This provision would create a duplicative training program, as it would authorize training \nwithin the core competencies of the National Guard, which already occurs within existing DOD \norganizations.  In addition, the provision would require additional resources to fund the full-time \npersonnel to command and administer the COE, provide the training, and fund the partnerships with \n7  universities and other institutions where some of the training would take place. \n \nSmall Business Contracting:  The Administration strongly supports efforts to increase Federal \ncontracting with small businesses, but opposes section 1631, which would establish a laudable but \noverly ambitious government-wide small business procurement goal and unrealistic individual \nagency goals that could undermine the goals process and take away the Government\u2019s ability to \nfocus its efforts where opportunities for small business contractors are greatest.  In addition, the \nAdministration objects to the level of complexity that section 1671 would add to the process for \nevaluating contract bundling, which will encourage a needless increase in litigation and place \nunnecessary constraints on agencies in making determinations that bundling is necessary and \njustified. \n \nOther Provisions Authorizing Activities with Partner Nations:  The Administration objects to \nsection 1532, which would limit activities of the Task Force on Business and Stability Operations \n(TFBSO) to only mining and natural resources industry development and reduces funding to $50 \nmillion.  The TFBSO has developed a unique capability to foster and expand business opportunities \nwithin Afghanistan.  The limited authority in Section 1532 and the reduction in funds would not \nallow TFBSO to continue its mission, particularly in mining and natural resources.  The \nAdministration supports continuing the authorities provided to the TFSBO in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. \n \nConstitutional Concerns:  A number of the bill's provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, \nincluding encroachment on the President's exclusive authorities related to international negotiations.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n \n8  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  October 12, 2011 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2273 \u2013 Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act \n  (Rep. McKinley, R-WV, and 32 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration opposes H.R. 2273, as reported by Committee, which is insufficient to \naddress the risks associated with coal ash disposal and management, and undermines the Federal \ngovernment\u2019s ability to ensure that requirements for management and disposal of coal \ncombustion residuals are protective of human health and the environment. \n \nThe 2008 failure of a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, which spilled more than \nfive million cubic yards of coal ash and will require approximately $1.2 billion for clean-up, is a \nstark reminder of the need for safe disposal and management of coal ash to protect public health \nand the environment.  The Administration has assessed structural stability at active coal ash \nimpoundments and has identified 49 units in 12 states as having a \u201chigh hazard potential\u201d rating \nshould they fail. \n  \nThe Administration supports the development, implementation, and enforcement of appropriate \nstandards for facilities managing coal ash, while encouraging the beneficial use of this \neconomically important material.  Any approach to managing coal ash would need to \ninclude:  (1) clear requirements that address the risks associated with the coal ash disposal and \nmanagement; (2) consideration of the best science and data available; (3) adequate evaluation of \nstructural integrity; (4) protective solutions for existing as well as new facilities; and (5) \nappropriate public information and comment. \n \nBecause H.R. 2273 is deficient in these areas and would replace existing authorities with \ninadequate and inappropriate minimum requirements, the Administration opposes the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \nJuly 9, 2012 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 6079 \u2013 Repealing the Affordable Care Act \n(Rep. Cantor, R-VA) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 6079 because it would cost millions of \nhard-working middle class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve.  It \nwould increase the deficit and detract from the work the Congress needs to do to focus on the economy \nand create jobs.   \n \nRepealing the Affordable Care Act would mean that marketplaces where Americans could compare \nprivate insurance plans and get tax credits to purchase them would not open.  Tax credits for small \nbusiness owners who cover their employees would be eliminated.  States would lose substantial \nFederal assistance under Medicaid to provide coverage for the neediest Americans.   \n \nBut repealing the health care law would have implications far beyond the estimated 30 million \nAmericans without insurance who would lose the health coverage they were going to receive.   \n \nMore than 250 million Americans with insurance \u2013 private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid \u2013 would \nlose the benefits and protections they receive under the health care law.  Insurance companies would \nbe able to go back to some of their worst practices.  They would no longer have to cover as dependents \nthe 6.6 million young adults who have been able to sign up on their parents' plans.  They would be able \nto impose lifetime limits and restrictive annual limits on coverage.  They could go back to denying \ncoverage to children with preexisting conditions.  And, they would likely turn away the nearly 70,000 \nAmericans who had gained insurance through Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plans, which would \nhave to shut down.  Insurance companies would no longer be held accountable for double-digit \npremium increases.  Strict rules that prevent insurance companies from spending too much on \nadministrative costs or CEO bonuses would be erased. \n \nReforms that strengthen Medicare's long-term finances would also be repealed.  Seniors would lose the \nmore generous prescription drug coverage provided under the health care law, as well as free \npreventive care.  And Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would become insolvent up to eight \nyears earlier. \n \nEstimates from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that repealing the health care law would add \nmore than $100 billion to the deficit over the next decade, and more than $1 trillion in the following \ndecade. \n \nThe last thing the Congress should do is refight old political battles and take a massive step backward \nby repealing basic protections that provide security for the middle class.  Right now, the Congress  needs to work together to focus on the economy and creating jobs.  Congress should act on the \nPresident's concrete plans to create an economy built to last by reducing the deficit in a balanced way \nand investing in education, clean energy, innovation, and infrastructure. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 6079, he would veto it. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n2  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  May 17, 2011 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 940 \u2013 Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act   \n (Sen. Menendez, D-New Jersey, and 28 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 940, which would repeal tens of \nbillions of dollars in special tax breaks for oil and gas companies over the next decade. \n \nWhile there is no single solution to addressing the effect of rising gas prices on American \nfamilies in the short term, the Administration has put forth a long-term plan to cut the Nation\u2019s \noil imports by one-third by 2025.  The plan includes increasing domestic production in the short \nterm, while investing in domestic alternative fuels, and increasing efficiency in the vehicles \nAmericans drive.  It is also clear that there are much more responsible ways to utilize the billions \nin taxpayer dollars provided to oil and gas companies through unwarranted tax breaks. \n \nThe Nation\u2019s outdated tax laws currently provide the oil and gas industry billions of dollars per \nyear in these subsidies, even though oil and gas prices are high and the industry is reporting \noutsized profits.  Furthermore, heads of the major oil and gas companies have in the past made it \nclear that high oil prices provide more than enough profit motive to invest in domestic \nexploration and production without special tax breaks.   \n \nThe Administration believes that, at a time when it is working with the Congress on proposals to \nreduce Federal deficits, the Nation cannot afford to maintain these wasteful subsidies.  The \nPresident proposed eliminating these subsidies in his FY 2010, FY 2011, and FY 2012 Budgets.  \nThe Administration believes these resources are better used for efforts that will help the \nAmerican people, such as deficit reduction or investments in clean home-grown sources of \nenergy.  The Administration considers this bill to be an important step toward more responsible \nfiscal and energy policies and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to end \nthese subsidies. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  November 10, 2011 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 674 \u2013Three Percent Withholding Repeal and Job Creation Act \n(Rep. Herger, R-CA, and 269 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 674 and an amendment offered by Senator \nTester that together will reduce unemployment and ensure that our veterans leave the military \nwith the tools they need to succeed in the civilian workforce.    \n \nH.R. 674 would repeal a three percent withholding on certain payments made to private \ncontractors by Federal, State, and local government entities.  The repeal of the withholding \nrequirement in H.R. 674 would reduce a burden on government contractors who otherwise \ncomply with their tax obligations, particularly small businesses.  As evidenced in the President's \nproposed American Jobs Act, released September 12, 2011, the Administration has supported \nalleviating this burden, which was originally enacted into law on May 17, 2006.  The \nAdministration also believes it is important to ensure that Federal contractors are compliant with \ntax laws and supports more targeted efforts that prevent persons with outstanding tax debts from \nreceiving Federal contracts.  The effect of the repeal of the withholding requirement would be to \navoid a decrease in cash flow to these contractors, which would allow them to retain these funds \nand use them to create jobs and pay suppliers.  This would complement the Administration's \nother efforts to help small businesses.  Repeal of the withholding requirement would also reduce \nimplementation costs borne by Federal and other governmental agencies. \n \nH.R. 674, as amended by Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011, contains the Returning Heroes and \nWounded Warrior tax credits for firms that hire unemployed veterans that the President proposed \nto the Congress as part of the American Jobs Act, as well as other reforms to ensure that the men \nand women who serve are able to navigate this labor market upon exiting the military. \n \nHaving served and defended the Nation, our veterans are well-trained, highly skilled and will add \nvalue to any company.   But today's veterans face unique challenges.  As of last month, over \n850,000 veterans were unemployed, and the jobless rate for post-9/11 veterans was 12.1 \npercent.   As we end the war in Iraq and wind down the war in Afghanistan, over one million \nservicemembers are projected to leave the military between 2011 and 2016.   We have an \nobligation to ensure that these men and women who have risked their lives to fight for our \ncountry do not have to fight for jobs when they return home.  \n \nThe Vow to Hire Heroes Act provides a new Returning Heroes Tax Credit for firms that hire \nunemployed veterans.   Firms that hire those veterans who have been unemployed at least 4 \nweeks will be eligible for a tax credit up to $2,400 per employee, while firms that hire veterans \nwho are long-term unemployed (looking for work for over 6 months) will be eligible for a tax \ncredit up to $5,600.  H.R. 674, as amended, also provides a Wounded Warriors Tax Credit of up \nto $9,600 that doubles the existing tax credit for firms that hire long-term unemployed veterans \nwith service-connected disabilities.  Together, these tax credits will create a powerful incentive \nfor firms to hire veterans and will help lower the veteran unemployment rate.   \nAs amended by the Vow to Hire Heroes Act, H.R. 674 further provides a number of additional \ntools to help veterans successfully transition to the civilian workforce.  The Administration has \nbeen strongly supportive of improving the Transition Assistance Program.  The amended H.R. \n674 builds on these steps and would make TAP mandatory for most servicemembers \ntransitioning to civilian status.    \n \nH.R. 674, as amended, also expands career counseling, educational, and training options for \nunemployed servicemembers, facilitates federal hiring of veterans, and tasks the Department of \nLabor to develop new tools to help translate military experience to the civilian sector.   All of \nthese reforms are consistent with the Presiden's direction on August 5, 2011, to the Department \nof Veteran Affairs and the Department of Defense to lead an interagency Task Force to ensure \nthat every member of the service receives the training, education, and credentials they need to \ntransition to the civilian workforce or to pursue higher education.  The Administration already \nmade substantial progress on these proposals.  The amended H.R. 674 will aid the Task Force's \nwork and ensure that our veterans have the support they need to transition to civilian life. \n \nFinally, H.R 674 as amended changes the calculation of modified adjusted gross income, as \ndefined in section 1401 of the Affordable Care Act, to include both taxable and non-taxable \nSocial Security benefits.  Beginning in 2014, this income definition will be used to determine \nfinancial eligibility for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and for \npremium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions available through Affordable Insurance \nExchanges.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n \nDecember 1, 2011 \n(House) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nH.R. 3463 \u2013 Termination of Taxpayer Financing of Presidential Election Campaigns and \nTermination of the Election Assistance Commission \n(Rep.

The bill would force \nmany candidates into an endless cycle of fundraising at the expense of engagement with voters \non the issues, and would place a premium on access to large donor or special interest support, \nnarrowing the field of otherwise worthy candidates. \n \nIn addition, H.R. 3463 would terminate the EAC, which was established after the 2000 \nPresidential election to improve the administration of elections.  The EAC continues to perform \ncrucial statutory responsibilities by serving as a national clearing house of information for \nelection officials and the public.  In addition, EAC continues to administer Federal grants to the \nStates that support necessary investments in reliable voting and elections equipment, issues and \nperiodically reviews Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, accredits voting system test labs, \ncertifies voting equipment, establishes best practices and guidelines on election administration \nfor State and local election officials, and aids implementation of the National Voter Registration \nAct (NVRA) and other Federal voting rights statutes.  The EAC has further demonstrated its \nvalue with accomplishments such as aiding in the implementation of access programs for \ndisabled voters.  As the only Federal entity charged principally with improving the \nadministration of elections, the EAC helps to protect voters' rights and the integrity of elections \nand plays an important role as part of the Nation's election system infrastructure.

Reid, D-Nevada) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports prompt and favorable action by the Congress on the \nAmerican Jobs Act of 2011, which will create jobs and get the economy moving.  S. 1660 \ncontains all of the jobs measures that were submitted to the Congress by the President last \nmonth.  These are the kinds of proposals supported by both Republicans and Democrats.  S. 1660 \nwill put more people back to work and put more money in the pockets of working Americans, \nand it will do so without adding a dime to the deficit. \n \nFirst, the American Jobs Act of 2011 provides tax cuts for small businesses and puts more \nmoney in the pockets of working and middle class Americans by cutting in half the payroll tax \nthat comes out of the paycheck of every worker.  Second, S. 1660 puts Americans back to work, \nincluding teachers, first responders, veterans, and construction workers.  Third, the American \nJobs Act of 2011 helps out-of-work Americans by extending unemployment benefits and \nreforming the system to help people get back to work.  It also supports training and \nunemployment programs to help the unemployed build key skills and connect to real jobs.  The \nbill also bans employers from discriminating against the unemployed when hiring and expands \njob opportunities for low-income youth and adults.   \n \nS. 1660 is fully paid for through a surtax on those making over $1 million per year.  The \nAdministration submitted an alternative set of offsets that would have cut back unjustified tax \nexpenditures and loopholes.  However, what is most important is putting Americans back to \nwork right now and making sure  the debt is not increased over time\u2014and doing so in a way that \nis fair.  S. 1660 meets that test.  Moreover, this surtax could ultimately be replaced by a broader \ntax reform consistent with the President\u2019s principles of cutting rates, cutting spending through \nthe tax code, cutting the deficit, increasing economic growth, and increasing fairness by ensuring \nthat no household making over $1 million should pay a smaller share of its income in taxes than \nmiddle-class families pay. \n \nThe American people understand that the economic crisis and the deep recession were not \ncreated overnight and will not be solved overnight.  The economic security of the middle class \nhas been under attack for decades.  The Administration believes that the Nation needs not only to \nrecover from this economic crisis, but to rebuild the economy the American way, based on \nbalance, fairness, and the same set of rules for everyone from Wall Street to Main Street.  By \nenacting S. 1660, the Congress and the President can work together to create the jobs of the \nfuture by helping small business entrepreneurs, working and middle-class Americans, and the \nunemployed Americans searching for work, and by investing in the Nation\u2019s education and \ninfrastructure. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nFebruary 15, 2011 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1 \u2013 Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 \n(Rep.

The Administration is committed to \ncutting spending and reducing the deficit so that current government spending does not add to \nthe debt and has put forward a plan to do just that.  However, the Administration does not \nsupport deep cuts that will undermine our ability to out-educate, out-build, and out-innovate the \nrest of the world.  The bill proposes cuts that would sharply undermine core government \nfunctions and investments key to economic growth and job creation, and would reduce funding \nfor the Department of Defense to a level that would leave the Department without the resources \nand flexibility needed to meet vital military requirements.  If the President is presented with a \nbill that undermines critical priorities or national security through funding levels or restrictions, \ncontains earmarks, or curtails the drivers of long-term economic growth and job creation while \ncontinuing to burden future generations with deficits, the President will veto the bill. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to refine the legislation to allow \ncritical government functions to operate without interruption for the remainder of the fiscal year \nunderway.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", " \n  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMarch 8, 2011 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 830 \u2013 FHA Refinance Program Termination Act \n(Rep.

This \nprogram offers a cost effective approach to assisting underwater borrowers and will lead to \nsustainable long term homeownership.  The Administration is committed to helping struggling \nAmerican homeowners stay in their homes, and has taken many steps over the last two years to \nstabilize what was a rapidly-declining housing market.  As nearly one quarter of American \nhomeowners are currently underwater on their mortgages, the Administration believes that \ncontinuation of the FHA refinancing programs is vital to the Nation\u2019s sustained economic \nrecovery. \n \nIf the President is presented with H.R. 830, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nNovember 28, 2012 \n                    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 6429 \u2013 STEM Jobs Act of 2012 \n (Rep.

This legislation, if enacted, would allocate immigrant \nvisas for advanced graduates of a limited set of STEM degree programs, would offer a limited \nnumber of visas for families through the \"V\" nonimmigrant visa program, and would eliminate \nthe long-standing Diversity Visa program that makes immigrant visas available to certain \nindividuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.    \n \nThe Administration is deeply committed to building a 21st-century immigration system that \nmeets the Nation's economic and security needs through common-sense, comprehensive \nimmigration reform.  As a part of immigration reform, the Administration strongly supports \nlegislation to attract and retain foreign students who graduate with advanced STEM degrees, to \nestablish a start-up visa for foreign-born entrepreneurs to start businesses and create jobs, and to \nreform the employment-based immigration system to better meet the needs of the U.S. economy.  \nHowever, the Administration does not support narrowly tailored proposals that do not meet the \nPresident's long-term objectives with respect to comprehensive immigration reform. \n \nThe Administration is encouraged that the Congress appears to be ready to begin serious debate \non the need to fix our broken immigration system and looks forward to working with both \nDemocrats and Republicans to enact a common-sense approach that includes reforms to the legal \nimmigration system.  Such an approach must provide for attracting and retaining highly skilled \nimmigrants and uniting Americans with their family members more quickly, as well as other \nimportant priorities such as establishing a pathway for undocumented individuals to earn their \ncitizenship, holding employers accountable for breaking the law, and continuing efforts to \nstrengthen the Nation's robust enforcement system. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nNovember 10, 2011 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2354 \u2013 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies  \nAppropriations Act, 2012 \n(Sen. Inouye, D-HI)  \n \nThe health of the Nation's economy depends on taking action now to create the conditions for the \neconomy to grow, businesses to hire, and the middle class to feel secure.  In the long run, the \nNation's prosperity also depends on the ability of the Congress to put the Nation on a sustainable \nfiscal course while making the investments the Nation needs to compete and win in the global \neconomy.  That is why the President has put forward a balanced plan to jumpstart economic \ngrowth and job creation now \u2013 and to lay the foundation for continued growth by achieving more \nthan $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years.  This bill invests in areas important to \nthe Nation's ability to grow and compete in the global economy while broadly sharing sacrifices \nto reduce the deficit. \n \nDivision 1 \u2013 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \n \nThe Administration urges the Senate to ensure that United States has the resources necessary to \nhelp the Nation thrive and compete in the future.  A strong energy sector requires investment in \ninnovation and clean energy technologies, access to clean water and outdoor recreational \nopportunities, and support for job creating measures like renewable energy projects and \ntechnologies. \n \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) \n \nClean Energy Research and Development (R&D).  The Administration strongly urges the \nSenate to provide $1.95 billion for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs and at \nleast $300 million for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, both of which are \ncritical to implementing the Administration's goals of transforming the Nation's economy to \nsupport clean energy jobs and improving U.S. energy security.  These investments will help \nimprove U.S. competitiveness in advanced manufacturing and in emerging technologies such as \nelectric vehicles and batteries, biofuels, energy efficient systems for buildings, solar energy, and \noffshore wind power. \n \nInnovation and R&D.  The Administration strongly urges the Senate to provide $4.95 billion for \nthe Office of Science to maintain its critical investment in America's innovation \nfuture.  Inadequate funding places fundamental research at risk in areas of science that underpin \nclean energy technologies and can spur innovation.  Inadequate funding levels will not allow \noptimum utilization of DOE research assets, hampering the development of the next generation \nof technologies and manufacturing for use in the automobile, semiconductor, pharmaceutical, \nand numerous other industries. \n \nEnergy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration appreciates Senate support and  urges the Senate to provide at least $105 million so that EIA can continue to provide independent \nand rigorous analysis of America's energy needs. \n \nLoan Guarantee Program.  The Administration appreciates that the Senate bill supports the loan \nguarantee program.  The Senate level of $200 million would support an estimated $1 billion to \n$2 billion in loan guarantees for innovative renewable energy and energy efficiency \nprojects.  The Administration urges the Senate to include funds for a new Better Building Pilot \nLoan Guarantee Program proposed in the President's FY 2012 Budget and additional loan \nvolume authority for nuclear power projects.  These programs are an important part of the \nNation's efforts to deploy innovative clean energy technologies. \n \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) \n \nWeapons Activities and Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation.  The Administration urges the Senate \nto support robust funding for NNSA to continue the commitment to modernize the nuclear \nweapons complex and upgrade the stockpile set forth in the Nuclear Posture Review and \nreaffirmed as part of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ratification process.  In addition, \nat a time when a grave danger is posed by the proliferation of nuclear materials that can fall into \nthe hands of terrorist organizations, the Administration appreciates Senate support for highly \nenriched uranium (HEU) reactor conversions and increased security for HEU and plutonium as \nhigh-priority elements of the global effort to lock down nuclear materials. \n \nCorps of Engineers (Corps) \n \nCorps Funding.  The Administration is concerned with the Senate funding level for the Corps, \nwhich is $233 million above the President's FY 2012 Budget.  The additional funding could be \nredirected toward higher-priority needs and programs that have a greater potential for results in a \ntime of scarce resources.  In addition, the Administration is concerned that in the allocation of \nfunds, the bill would preclude funding for the limited number of priority new starts in the \nPresident's FY 2012 Budget, including an important new program to reverse damage to the \ncoastal Louisiana ecosystem and a study called for by the Congress to examine flood risks \nnationwide in order to improve existing programs. \n \nDisaster Relief Funding.  Consistent with past practice, the Administration supports providing \nadditional funding to repair Federal flood control and other infrastructure damaged by natural \ndisasters.  The Administration will work with the Congress as the Corps verifies the funding \nlevel that is necessary to accomplish this work and that is appropriately designated for a disaster \nrelief cap adjustment under section 251 of the Budget Control Act. \n \nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation \n \nOverall Bureau of Reclamation Funding.  The Administration believes the $20 million in \nfunding above the President's FY 2012 Budget is unnecessary.  These funds could be redirected \ntoward higher priority needs and programs that have a greater potential for results in a time of \nscarce resources. \n \nDivision 2 \u2013 Financial Services and General Government \n \nThe Administration urges the Senate to provide the resources necessary to fund core Government \nfunctions as well as implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \n2  Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  Through reforms to cut waste, reduce errors, and boost \nquality, the ACA will reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars, while ensuring that \nquality, affordable coverage is available for all Americans.  The Dodd-Frank Act contains \nessential measures to crack down on abuses in the mortgage industry, make financial contracts \nsimpler, end hidden fees, and provide clear and concise information to borrowers about the \nobligations they are undertaking. \n \nDepartment of the Treasury \n \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS)\u2013Tax Enforcement.  The Administration strongly supports \nincreased funding for IRS tax enforcement, compliance, and service activities above the Senate \nbill level.  The reductions in the Senate bill will lead to the loss of at least $3.5 billion in Federal \nrevenue, as well as reductions of approximately 4,000 in staff.  The Administration strongly \nencourages the Senate to adopt the Administration's proposed IRS program integrity allocation \nadjustment in the bill or find another means to support increased IRS funding.  Tax enforcement \nand compliance activities typically return $7 or more on each taxpayer dollar spent. \n \nIRS\u2013Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The Administration strongly supports full funding for the IRS \nto meet its ACA implementation responsibilities, including standing up critical systems to \nsupport Affordable Insurance Exchanges. \n \nDepartmental Operations.  The Administration supports the Senate funding level of $306 \nmillion for Departmental Offices (DO), including its retention of Terrorism and Financial \nIntelligence program funding within the DO account.  The overall DO funding level supports \nthe Department of the Treasury's ability to implement priority programs, including tax and \nregulatory reform. \n \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The Administration appreciates \nthe $200 million for CDFI, including the support for Administration initiatives, such as the \nHealthy Food Financing Initiative that will increase the availability of affordable, healthy food \noutlets in underserved urban and rural communities that lack adequate access to healthy food. \n \nOffice of Personnel and Management (OPM) \n \nNew Statutory Responsibilities.  The funding level provided by the bill would limit OPM's \nability to implement and administer new statutory responsibilities. \n \nExecutive Office of the President \n \nPartnership Fund for Program Integrity Innovation.  The Administration urges the Senate to \nsustain the Partnership Fund for Program Integrity Innovation by extending the period of \navailability for the existing program funds.  This extension would enable continued \ncollaboration with States and other stakeholders to launch additional pilots designed to find \npromising ways to save taxpayer funds across Government programs by cutting improper \npayments and streamlining program administration. \n \nIntegrated, Efficient, and Effective Uses of Information Technology (IEEUIT).  The \nAdministration urges the Senate to provide additional funding for this initiative.  IEEUIT will \nincrease the potential for future savings achievable through broader support to agency plans for \ncloud computing and data center consolidation, and a more rigorous IT investment oversight \n3  process. \n \nGeneral Services Administration \n \nFederal Buildings Fund (FBF).  The Administration commends the Senate for fully funding \nFBF operating costs \u2013 including rental of space, buildings operations, and installment \nacquisition.  While the Administration appreciates Senate funding of $65 million for capital \ninvestment, the Administration is concerned that the bill would, for the second year in a row, \nprovide insufficient resources to address needed repairs and alterations, and urges the Senate \nto include additional funding for these purposes. \n \nIntegrated Acquisition Environment.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide funding \nfor the Integrated Acquisition Environment, which would increase procurement data quality \nand system functionality while reducing costs and burden for both the Federal Government \nand businesses working with or seeking to work with the Federal Government. \n \nElectronic Government.  The Administration recommends that the Senate not combine the E-\nGovernment and the Federal Citizen Services Fund and that the Senate provide adequate funding \nto continue with initiatives that enhance transparency and oversight into Government spending, \nand yield a high return on investment through cost saving efficiencies.  The E-Government Fund \nhas yielded billions in cost savings and cost avoidance over the last two years.  Combining the E-\nGovernment and Federal Citizen Services funds would introduce a level of uncertainty around \nhow the funds would be allocated given the differing mandates of the funds.  Furthermore, a new \nfund would not be subject to the Electronic Government Act of 2002. \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Administration strongly supports funding for \nthe SEC at the Senate bill level of $1.4 billion, which will enable the SEC to carry out without \ndelay its increased responsibilities for registration, oversight, and enforcement within the \nsecurities marketplace. \n \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The Administration strongly supports the \nSenate level of $240 million for CFTC.  This funding level will better enable CFTC to provide \nthe necessary oversight of the futures and swaps marketplace in a timely and effective \nmanner.  Moreover, the Administration strongly supports the Senate bill's provision of $66 \nmillion for major IT system investments, which are essential to CFTC's oversight and clearing \nresponsibilities as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. \n \nFederal Communications Commission (FCC).  The Administration supports the Senate funding \nlevel and terms provided to the FCC, which would be fully paid for through fee collections and \nwill allow the FCC to protect an open Internet and fulfill its other missions.  The Administration \nsupports a free and open Internet that fosters investment, innovation, consumer choice and free \nspeech, and is committed to ensuring that the Internet continues as an open platform for \nproductivity, growth, and innovation. \n \nSmall Business Administration (SBA).  The Administration urges the Senate to provide funding \nfor SBA's Emerging Leaders Program and Entrepreneurial Development Initiative to support \nwell-targeted business-led economic growth and job creation. \n \n4  Election Assistance Commission (EAC).  The Administration supports funding EAC at the \nrequested level of $14 million to maintain the Commission's ability to fulfill its statutorily \nrequired duties and protect the integrity of elections. \n \nBill-Wide Provisions \n \nCuba.  The Administration opposes, as written, section 624 in the Senate Committee bill, but \nsupports its intent to reduce financial fees that may currently be assessed on transactions related \nto U.S. exports of goods pursuant to the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act \nof 2000.  The Administration would not oppose section 624 if certain technical corrections are \nmade. \n \nTransfers for E-Government Initiatives.  The Administration supports amending section 732 of \nthe Senate bill to allow inter-agency transfers of funds for E-Government initiatives 15 days after \nnotification of House and Senate Appropriations Committees for continuing initiatives (30 days \nafter notification for new E-Government initiatives), without the requirement for prior approval \nof the appropriations committees.  The business process for E-Government initiatives would be \nfacilitated by allowing individual appropriations bills to address this issue where it may be a \nconcern, without imposing conditions for prior approval across all Executive Branch agencies. \n \nContracting Closely Associated Government Functions.  The Administration opposes section \n741 of the Senate bill, which would require civilian agencies to ensure, to the maximum extent \npracticable, that contracts do not include functions that are closely associated with inherently \ngovernmental functions.  Agencies should not be expected to stop using contractors to perform \nthese functions, as long as the agency is giving adequate management attention to ensure \ncontractors are not impinging on the agency's inherently governmental responsibilities.  The \nproposed requirement to collect \"cost data\" should also be stricken as it would be unnecessarily \nburdensome on contractors without commensurate benefit. \n \nDivision 3 \u2013 State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs \n \nThe Senate bill for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs supports vital, \nbipartisan efforts aimed at the root causes of instability and insecurity in fragile and failing \ncountries around the world.  It protects key priorities while making difficult choices, such as \nadopting proposals in the President's FY 2012 Budget to reduce assistance to countries in Europe \nand Central Asia with lesser need.  By contrast, the Administration would strongly oppose \nmeasures that undermine needed funding for civilian engagement in support of critical U.S. \ninterests around the world. \n \n \nOverseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Administration appreciates the support for \nOCO funding in the Senate bill, which is essential to achieving the Administration's foreign \npolicy and national security priorities in the frontline states.  While funding for these programs \nis increasing at the Department of State, the increases are more than offset by over $40 billion \nin decreases to Department of Defense OCO, as operations transition from military to civilian \nleadership.  The Senate is urged to adequately fund both base and OCO funding for the \nmissions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. \n \nIraq.  While the Administration appreciates congressional support for assistance and operations \nin Iraq, the Administration is concerned about the reductions to the request for Department of \n5  State operations and assistance programs in the Senate bill.  The Administration's request for \neconomic and security assistance is necessary to sustain the Administration's transition plans, \nand reductions will slow needed capacity-building programs for Iraqi Ministries, particularly for \ntraining programs for the Iraq police.  The Administration is also concerned about the $570 \nmillion combined OCO and base reduction (minus 15 percent) for Diplomatic and Consular \nPrograms in the Senate bill.  A reduction of this magnitude would eliminate the flexibility \nnecessary during a key transition period for the U.S. presence in Iraq. \n \nGlobal Health, Food Security, and Global Climate Change Initiatives.  The Administration \ncommends the Senate bill's essential provisions for global health, food security, and climate \nchange. \n \nEconomic Support Fund (ESF).  The Administration is concerned that the $388 million \nprovided by the Senate could result in dramatic reductions to country assistance levels.  In \naddition, the Administration opposes the Senate rescission of $150 million of unexpended \nbalances.  Following the $120 million rescission in FY 2011, an additional rescission could \nrequire deobligating funds committed to countries and programs, harming the Government's \nobjectives in and relations with those countries.  In particular, at a time when ESF funds are \ncentral to the U.S. response to the Arab Awakening, these cuts and rescissions will impact State \nand United States Agency for International Development's ability to respond to rapid \ndevelopments in the Middle East. \n \nEmergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) Fund.  The Administration opposes the \nSenate bill's elimination of a separate appropriation to support the ERMA Fund.  The Fund \nprovides the President with a flexible tool to meet unexpected urgent refugee and migration \nneeds on such terms and conditions as the President may determine.  Action by the President \nto utilize ERMA funds can leverage other donations on behalf of humanitarian emergencies by \nproviding a separate funding mechanism used only to respond to emergent crises. \n \nTreasury Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs).  The Administration appreciates the Senate \nCommittee bill's $2.1 billion for MDBs, fully funding three of four General Capital Increase \n(GCI) installments and U.S. commitments to multilateral debt relief, while meeting a sizable \nportion of replenishment commitments to the concessional windows.  The Administration also \nappreciates the Senate bill's inclusion of needed authorization language for all requested GCIs \nand replenishments. However, the Administration is concerned about funding shortfalls for the \nAfrican Development Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank and would like to work \nwith the Committees to find a solution.  \n \nLanguage Provisions.  The Administration appreciates that the Senate bill includes \nappropriations language that is needed to carry out key foreign policy objectives.  This includes \nauthority to support the Arab Awakening, which would authorize Egyptian debt swaps, Tunisian \nloan guarantees, and new enterprise funds.  The Senate bill also authorizes critically needed \ngeneral capital increases for three multilateral development banks and lifting the cap on U.S. \ncontributions to United Nations peacekeeping, consistent with the contribution level in prior \nyears.  Further, the Senate bill includes language relating to State Department management that \nwould allow a new maintenance cost sharing program to address the Department's large overseas \nmaintenance backlog and continue collection of fees under the Western Hemisphere Travel \nInitiative.  All of these provisions need to be included in a final bill. \n \nHowever, the Administration opposes several significant changes in the bill's certification and \n6  reporting requirements and requests a more workable solution to these requirements.  The \nAdministration will also work with the Congress to explore opportunities where increased \ntransfer authority will provide flexibility to manage this constrained resource level. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nNumerous provisions of the Senate bill, including sections 7013, 7029, 7032, 7035, 7039, 7047, \n7048, 7061, 7062, 7065, 7069, 7070, and 7073, could infringe upon the President's constitutional \nauthority over foreign affairs by interfering with his conduct of foreign diplomacy and \ninteractions with foreign diplomats.  In addition, section 7046(a) of the Senate bill would \ninfringe upon the President's authority as Commander in Chief and over the conduct of foreign \ndiplomacy by restricting his ability to place U.S. forces under the command of a foreign national \nin certain circumstances.  The Administration urges that these provisions be made advisory \nrather than mandatory.  Section 7093(c)(3) of the Senate bill also raises constitutional concerns \nby potentially requiring the disclosure to the Congress of diplomatic communications and other \nsensitive information relating to national security and foreign affairs.  If any of the provisions \ndiscussed above are enacted in their present form, the Administration will apply them in a \nmanner consistent with the President's constitutional authorities. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n7  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n  July 10, 2012 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 2237 \u2013 Small Business Jobs and Tax Relief Act \n(Sen. Reid, D-NV, and 6 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2237 to give small businesses a tax break \nfor increasing wages, creating new jobs, and making new investments.  By providing targeted tax relief \nto the businesses that are expanding their workforce and making new investments in capital, S. 2237 \nwill help spur economic growth and job creation and strengthen the recovery.  Targeted tax relief for \nsmall businesses is one of the five to-do items the President has called on the Congress to pass as part \nof a concrete plan that creates jobs and helps restore middle class security. \n \nUnder S. 2237, nearly two million companies that make new hires or increase wages would receive a \n10 percent income tax credit on their new payroll, encouraging over $200 billion in new hiring and pay \nraises.  Because the credit is limited to $5 million in new wages (for a credit of up to $500,000 per \nfirm), S. 2237 is particularly beneficial to small businesses.  S. 2237 is also focused on middle class \nworkers.  Because the credit is based on the Social Security wage base, companies would receive no \ncredit for increasing wages above $110,100.  The Congressional Budget Office recently found this type \nof targeted tax relief to be the single most effective business tax option for boosting hiring and spurring \neconomic growth.  \n \nS. 2237 would also put an additional $50 billion in the hands of businesses over this year and the next \nby extending the 100 percent expensing provision that the President signed into law in December 2010, \nwhich rewards firms for making new investments by allowing them to immediately deduct the full \nvalue of those investments in calculating their taxable earnings.  S. 2237 provides a direct incentive for \ncompanies to hire workers and make the sorts of investments that will boost economic growth.  In \naddition, this legislation ensures that companies that are actively cutting their workforce or that offer \nraises only to already well-paid executives would be ineligible for the tax relief.   \n \nThe President believes that entrepreneurs and small businesses are engines of innovation and economic \ngrowth and are currently at the forefront of the Nation's economic recovery.  The proposals in S. 2237 \nbuild on the 18 small business tax cuts that the President has already signed into law, ranging from the \nsmall business health tax credit to the temporary tax exclusion of capital gains from key small business \ninvestments.  Congress should act now to help American small businesses hire and grow with targeted \ntax relief designed to boost jobs, rather than enacting additional costly tax cuts for the most fortunate.    \n \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nJanuary 7, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 30 \u2013 Save American Workers Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Young, R-Indiana) \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 30, the Save American \nWorkers Act, because it would significantly increase the deficit, reduce the number of \nAmericans with employer-based health insurance coverage, and create incentives for employers \nto shift their employees to part-time work \u2013 causing the problem it intends to solve.  Rather than \nattempting once again to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act, which the House has tried \nto do over 50 times, it is time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the \nPresident in forwarding an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and \nsecurity for middle class families and all those working to be a part of the middle class. \nThis legislation would weaken a provision of the Affordable Care Act designed to maintain \nemployer-based health insurance coverage, protect their employees, and prevent employers\u2019 \nhealth-benefit costs from being shifted to taxpayers.  According to the July estimates from the \nCongressional Budget Office, it would increase the budget deficit by $45.7 billion over the 2015 \nto 2024 period, reduce the number of people receiving employer-based health insurance \ncoverage, and increase the number of individuals who are uninsured.  While the Administration \nappreciates the concerns that result from the current 30-hour definition of full-time work, there is \nno evidence that this has caused a broad shift to part-time work to date. According to data from \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, since the Affordable Care Act became law, more than 90 percent \nof the increase in employment has been in full-time jobs, and over that time, the economy has \nadded 10.8 million private-sector jobs.  Furthermore, by moving the threshold to 40 hours, this \nlegislation could cause the problem it claims to solve by greatly increasing the number of \nworkers for whom employers may have an incentive to reduce hours to avoid the requirement. \nThe Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care.  Since 2013, \nestimates show that about 10 million Americans have gained health coverage.  Nearly 6.5 million \nhave renewed or newly signed up for health insurance coverage through the Federally-facilitated \nHealth Insurance Marketplaces to date, and open enrollment continues through \nFebruary 15.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, Americans who have previously been denied \ncoverage due to a pre-existing medical condition now have access to coverage.  Additionally, the \nlaw allows millions of young Americans to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26, and provides \naccess to free preventive care like cancer screenings that can catch illness early on.

After more than five years under this law, 16.4 million Americans have \ngained health coverage.  Up to 129 million people who could have otherwise been denied or \nfaced discrimination now have access to coverage.  And, health care prices have risen at the \nslowest rate in nearly 50 years.  As we work to make the system even better, we are open to ideas \nthat improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of health care, and help middle-class \nAmericans.   \n \nH.R. 160, which would provide a large tax break to profitable corporations by repealing the \nmedical device excise tax, does not advance these goals.  The medical device industry, like \nothers, will benefit from millions of new consumers who are gaining health coverage under the \nAffordable Care Act.  This excise tax is one of several designed so that industries that gain from \nthe coverage expansion will help offset the cost of that expansion.  Its repeal would take away a \nfunding source for financial assistance that is working to improve coverage and affordability and \nwould increase the Federal deficit by $24.4 billion over 10 years.   \n \nIn sum, H.R. 160 would increase the deficit to finance a permanent and costly tax break for \nindustry without improving the health system or helping middle-class Americans.

The bill's \nrequirements could force agencies to make decisions based on incomplete information or \ninformation that may not be available, including potential environmental and community impacts \nof the proposed pipelines, within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise \nwould have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time.

Whitehouse, D-RI, and 42 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to addressing the opioid epidemic through enhanced \nprevention, treatment, and recovery efforts.  New data from the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention show that opioids\u2014a class of drugs that includes prescription pain medications and \nheroin\u2014were involved in 28,648 deaths in 2014.  Prescription pain medication deaths remain far \ntoo high, and 2014 marked a sharp increase in heroin-involved deaths and an increase in deaths \ninvolving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.  In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for \nprescription opioids, which is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of \npills.  Four in five new heroin users started out by misusing prescription drugs.  Policies aimed at \npreventing, responding to, and treating opioid use disorders are essential to turning the tide on \nthis epidemic. \n \nS. 524 includes important objectives such as: increasing education and awareness about the \nmisuse of prescription opioids; expanding the availability of medication-assisted treatment, \nincluding in criminal justice settings; supporting treatment as an alternative to incarceration; \ntraining and equipping first responders on the use of the opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone; \nsupporting emergency services in rural areas; and providing recovery support services. \n \nHowever, while S. 524 identifies several steps needed to respond to the opioid epidemic, the \nAdministration is concerned that the bill does not include the funding necessary to implement \nthese steps\u2014and until that funding is provided by the Congress, these steps would do little to \naddress the epidemic.  Moreover, rather than accelerate important policies like training health \ncare providers about appropriate opioid prescribing, the bill includes an unnecessary feasibility \nstudy on the issue that would delay action.   \n \nThe President's Fiscal Year 2017 Budget includes $1 billion in new mandatory funding to \nexpand access to treatment and recovery services for opioid use disorders, support the placement \nof substance use disorder treatment providers in the communities most in need of behavioral \nhealth providers, and continue to build the evidence base for effective treatment programs.  This \nfunding will boost efforts to help individuals with an opioid use disorder to seek treatment, \nsuccessfully complete treatment, and sustain recovery.  The Budget also includes more than $90 \nmillion in additional  discretionary funding that builds on current efforts across the Departments \nof Justice and Health and Human Services to expand state-level prescription drug overdose \nprevention strategies, expand access to medication assisted treatment, improve access to the \noverdose-reversal drug naloxone, and support targeted enforcement activities. \n \n \n \n  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on securing funding to provide \nfamilies and communities with the support they need for opioid abuse prevention and to ensure \nthat treatment is available for those who seek it. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nApril 29, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 1732 \u2013 Regulatory Integrity Protection Act  \n(Rep. Shuster (R-PA) and 70 co-sponsors)  \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1732, which would require the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army (Army) to withdraw and re-propose \nspecified draft regulations needed to clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act \n(CWA).  The agencies' rulemaking, grounded in science, is essential to ensure clean water for \nfuture generations, and is responsive to calls for rulemaking from Congress, industry, and \ncommunity stakeholders as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The proposed rule has \nbeen through an extensive public engagement process.  \nClean water is vital for the success of the Nation's businesses, agriculture, energy development, \nand the health of our communities.  More than one in three Americans get their drinking water \nfrom rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that are at risk of pollution from upstream sources.  The \nprotection of wetlands is vital for hunting and fishing.  When Congress passed the CWA in 1972, \nto restore the Nation's waters, it recognized that to have healthy communities downstream, we \nneed to protect the smaller streams and wetlands upstream.   \nClarifying the scope of the CWA helps to protect clean water, safeguard public health, and \nstrengthen the economy.  Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 focused on specific \njurisdictional determinations and rejected the analytical approach that the Army Corps of \nEngineers was using for those determinations, but did not invalidate the underlying regulation.  \nThis has created ongoing questions and uncertainty about how the regulation is applied \nconsistent with the Court's decisions.  The proposed rule would address this uncertainty. \nIf enacted, H.R. 1732 would derail current efforts to clarify the scope of the CWA, hamstring \nfuture regulatory efforts, and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty needed \nto invest in projects that rely on clean water.  H.R. 1732 also would delay by a number of years \nany action to clarify the scope of the CWA, because it would:  (1) require the agencies to re-\npropose a rule that has already gone through an extensive public comment process; and (2) create \na burdensome advisory process that would complicate the agencies' rulemaking and potentially \nconstrain their discretion.  The agencies have already conducted an extensive and lengthy \noutreach to a broad range of stakeholders who will continue to be engaged in the current process. \nDuplicative outreach and consultation would impose unnecessary burdens and excessive costs on \nall parties.     \nThe final rule should be allowed to proceed.  EPA and Army have sought the views of and \nlistened carefully to the public throughout the extensive public engagement process for this rule.  \nIt would be imprudent to dismiss the years of work that have already occurred and no value \nwould be added.  The agencies need to be able to finish their work. \nIn the end, H.R. 1732, like its predecessors, would sow more confusion and invite more conflict  at a time when our communities and businesses need clarity and certainty around clean water \nregulation.  Simply put, this bill is not an act of good government; rather, it would hinder the \nongoing rulemaking process and the agencies' ability to respond to the public as well as two \nSupreme Court rulings. \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 1732, his senior advisors would recommend that \nhe veto the bill. \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nMay 16, 2016 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nSenate Amendment to H.R. 2577 \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 \n(Sen. Cochran, R-MS) \n \nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2577, \ncontaining the text of the bills making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and \nHousing and Urban Development, and for military construction, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other \npurposes.  \n \nThe Administration welcomes the bill's investments in military infrastructure, housing, services \nfor men and women in our armed forces and their families, rental assistance for low-income \nfamilies, the elderly, and the disabled, as well as its investments in programs that reduce lead-\nbased paint hazards for low-income families with children.  The Administration also appreciates \nthe Committee's commitment to fund the benefits and services our veterans have earned, help \nreduce the claims backlog, support medical and prosthetic research, and provide the requested \nadvanced appropriations.  In addition, the Administration appreciates the bill's support of surface \ntransportation priorities, including TIGER grants, Transit New Starts and Amtrak and passenger \nrail service.  Furthermore, the Administration welcomes the bill's support of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, including the Next Generation Air Transportation System initiative, as well as \nkey functions in the Office of the Secretary initiated in the FAST ACT.    \n \nHowever, the Administration is concerned that the bill underfunds critical investments in ending \nhomelessness and revitalizing distressed communities, leaving over 40,000 chronically homeless \nindividuals and homeless families with children unserved, and failing to address the widening \nopportunity gap confronting the Nation's poorest neighborhoods.  Additionally, the bill does not \nsupport the President's full vision for a 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan that expands \ntransportation options for American families, while reducing carbon emissions, cutting oil \nconsumption, and creating new jobs.  Further, the Administration is concerned that the bill \nincludes provisions that would undermine the safety of the Nation's highway system and includes \nunwarranted restrictions on the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the \nUnited States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, as these \nrestrictions further impede the Executive Branch's efforts to responsibly close the facility. \n \nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated \nfor FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense \nspending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class \nfamilies, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that \nagreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.   However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological \nprovisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the final bill that is presented to \nthe President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n   \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDivision A \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \n \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) \n \n21st Century Clean Transportation Plan.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not \nsupport the President's vision for a 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan that expands \ntransportation options for American families while reducing carbon emissions, cutting oil \nconsumption, and creating new jobs.  The Administration urges the Congress to consider strategic \nopportunities to enhance revenue and investments to support a new, clean, sustainable \ntransportation system and increase the competitiveness and productivity of the economy. \n \nFederal Transit Administration (FTA) New Starts Capital Investment.  The Administration \nappreciates the support provided in the bill for this program but is disappointed that the bill does \nnot provide the $3.5 billion requested as part of the Clean Transportation Plan.  Such funding \nwould increase the capacity of the Nation's transit network and help meet ridership demands in \nmany communities. \n \nAmtrak and Passenger Rail.  The Administration appreciates funding provided in the bill for \nAmtrak, rail safety and improvement programs but urges the Congress to support the FY 2017 \nBudget request of over $2 billion to support and improve our Nation's passenger rail service. \n \nTransportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.  The \nAdministration appreciates the Committee's continued support for the TIGER program but is \ndisappointed that the bill does not provide the full FY 2017 Budget request of $1.25 billion to \nfund infrastructure projects of national and regional significance.  Demand for TIGER has been \noverwhelming, with over $134 billion requested in more than 6,700 applications to date. \n \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided \nfor FAA, but is concerned with provisions that undermine FAA's ability to optimize certain \nservices.  The bill also misses an opportunity to improve airport infrastructure by focusing \nFederal grants to support smaller commercial and general aviation airports that do not have \naccess to additional revenue while increasing the Passenger Facility Charge for all commercial \nairports. \n \nHighway Safety.  The Administration is concerned about provisions in the bill that have the \npotential to undercut public safety, including section 131 of the bill regarding DOT's \"Hours of \nService\" regulation addressing driver fatigue. \n \nOther Reforms.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for other reforms \nincluding providing $3 million in funding for the National Surface Transportation and Innovative \n2  Finance Bureau and $3 million for the new Interagency Infrastructure Permitting Improvement \nCenter. \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the \nCongress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOT to implement the Data Act.  This \nfunding supports the Department's efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, \nsuch as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking \nfinancial and Federal award data with the Award ID. \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 \nBudget request for DOT to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding supports efforts to \nimprove digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses. \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nTenant-Based Rental Assistance.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to fund the \nHousing Choice Voucher Program at the requested level of $20.9 billion.  While the funding level \nis sufficient to provide nearly the same level of assistance to families as in FY 2016, the bill does \nnot fund the requested 10,000 new targeted vouchers necessary to make progress to end \nhomelessness among families by 2020 or the requested $2.1 billion for Administrative Fees to \nimprove mobility and ensure that assisted units are safe and habitable.  However, the \nAdministration appreciates the Committee's support for the Mobility Counseling Program, which \nwould help low-income families access safer neighborhoods, better schools, and areas with more \njob opportunities. \n \nHomeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides only  \n$2.3 billion in funding for the Homeless Assistance Grants program, which is $334 million below \nthe FY 2017 Budget request.  Although the bill provides $40 million for youth homelessness, \nwhich is $15 million above the FY 2017 Budget request, the bill does not provide the requested \nfunds to support the Administration's efforts to end chronic homelessness among individuals or \nfamilies with children. \n \nChoice Neighborhoods.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Choice \nNeighborhoods program, a key part of the President's Promise Zones initiative to accelerate \neconomic mobility and revitalization in high-poverty communities.  The Administration objects \nto the $80 million provided, which is $120 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  This \nwould fund only 2-3 implementation grants in 2017, leaving dozens of distressed communities \nuntouched.  The Administration also opposes the requirement that implementation grants be \nawarded only to prior planning grantees, which would penalize communities that have invested \ntheir own funds in large-scale planning efforts and may be strong candidates for an \nimplementation grant. \n \nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) Administrative Fee.  The Administration urges the \nCongress to adopt the proposed new FHA fee and provide the FY 2017 Budget request of $160 \nmillion for FHA administrative expenses.  The request level would lower taxpayer risks and \nimprove access to mortgage credit for underserved borrowers by enabling FHA to both \nstrengthen and clarify its lender oversight and compliance policies.  \n \n \n3  ConnectHome Initiative.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest of $5 million for the ConnectHome initiative.  The requested funding level would narrow \nthe digital divide by facilitating high-speed internet access and providing digital literacy services \nto students and families in public housing, a population that faces numerous barriers in accessing \nthe resources and skills needed to succeed in the 21st Century. \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 \nBudget request for HUD to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding would support the \nDepartment's efforts to manage and improve the agency's digital services that have the greatest \nimpact on citizens and businesses. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions in the bill, including sections 188, 223, 405, and 406, raise separation of \npowers concerns. \n \nDivision B \u2013 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies \n \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) \n \nMilitary Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for DOD's \nmilitary construction and family housing requirements.  The projects requested in the FY 2017 \nBudget reflect the highest priority projects for DOD.  \n \nDetainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to section 409 of the bill, which prohibits \nthe use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house \nindividuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This provision would constrain the \nflexibility that the Executive Branch needs to be able to determine the appropriate disposition of \ndetainees, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests. \n \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) \n \nVA Funding.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for our Nation's veterans \nand commends the Committee for including general transfer authority language.  This funding \nwould ensure continued benefits and services that our veterans deserve, though the $154 million \nreduction from the FY 2017 Budget request could delay needed repairs to hospitals and clinics. \n \nWhistleblower Complaints.  The Administration objects to section 246 of the bill, which contains \nunnecessary and unworkable language regarding whistleblowers.  VA has in place long-standing \nauthorities, remedies, and programs specifically created to address claims of improper retaliation \nin the workplace, and the Senate is urged to eliminate this section from the bill.  In addition, \nsection 246 could raise constitutional concerns in certain applications. \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration \nappreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for VA to implement \nthe DATA Act.  This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, \nsuch as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking \nfinancial and Federal award data with the Award ID. \n \n4  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the \nFY 2017 Budget request for VA to continue support of a digital service team.  This funding \nwould support efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on veterans, \ncitizens and businesses. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nOther provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 113 and 127 of \nthe bill may interfere with the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n5  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nApril 12, 2016 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3791 \u2013 Raise the Consolidated Assets Threshold under the Small Bank Holding \nCompany Policy Statement \n(Rep. Love, R-UT, and four cosponsors)  \n   \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3791, a bill that seeks to raise the consolidated assets \nthreshold under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $5 \nbillion. \n \nThe primary purpose of the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Policy Statement) \nis to make it easier for small banks to raise capital so they can continue to provide services to \ntheir local communities.  The Policy Statement also ensures that when small, community \ninstitutions are purchased, they are more likely to be purchased by another community institution \nrather than a larger bank.  Less than one year ago, the Congress reached a compromise to raise \nthe Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement threshold from $500 million to $1 billion.  \nThat change was intended to ensure that local communities retain access to the banks that best \nunderstand their needs and can provide personalized services to residents.  Now, less than one \nyear later, this piece of legislation seeks to raise that threshold again \u2013 to $5 billion \u2013 in an \nattempt to allow large banks to evade specific minimum leverage and risk-based capital \nrequirements.  These limitations were put in place to ensure that banks remain sound and able to \nserve their customers.  Community banks with $1 to $5 billion in assets already have sufficient \naccess to capital markets and as a group are exhibiting health and resilience.  Raising the \nthreshold to exempt banks with over $1 billion from important minimum leverage and capital \nrequirements would do little more than encourage banks to take on debt, endangering their \nsoundness and potentially depriving their customers of much needed banking services should the \nbank fail. \n \nSetting the consolidated assets threshold at $1 billion was a bipartisan decision that struck a \nbalance between allowing small banks to access capital to better serve their customers, and \nensuring their safety and soundness.  Raising the threshold to $5 billion less than a year later \nwould be an unnecessary and risky change. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3791, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n) \nJune 23, 2015  \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2042 \u2013 Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Whitfield, R-KY, and 67 co-sponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2042, which would undermine the public health \nprotections of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and threaten to slow or stop U.S. progress in cutting \ndangerous carbon pollution from power plants.  \n \nIn 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that Greenhouse Gas (GHG) \npollution threatens Americans' health and welfare by leading to long-lasting climate changes that \nare already having a range of negative effects on human health and the environment.  Power \nplants account for roughly one-third of all domestic GHG emissions.  While the United States \nlimits emissions of arsenic, mercury, and lead pollution from power plants, there are no national \nlimits on power plant carbon pollution. As part of his Climate Action Plan, the President directed \nEPA to work with States, utilities, and other stakeholders to develop the first ever national \nstandards to address carbon pollution from power plants.  In June 2014, EPA proposed to do just \nthat by issuing the Clean Power Plan proposal for public comment.   \n \nThe bill would give governors unprecedented and broad discretion to avoid compliance with the \nCAA, thereby delaying the delivery of important public health benefits.  The bill\u2019s effects would \nbe felt hardest by those most at risk from the impacts of air pollution and climate change, such as \nthe elderly, the infirm, children, native and tribal groups, and low-income populations.    \n \nIn addition, the bill is premature and unnecessary.  It is premature because the Clean Power Plan \nhas not yet been finalized; it is unnecessary because EPA has made clear its commitment to \naddress concerns raised during the public comment period (including concerns related to cost \nand reliability) when issuing the final Clean Power Plan this summer and working with the States \non the development of the State Plans.  The effect of the bill would therefore be a wholly \nunnecessary postponement of reductions of harmful air pollution.  \n \nThe bill also is unprecedented. The Administration is not aware of any instance when Congress \nhas enacted legislation to stay implementation of a CAA standard during judicial review.  To do \nso here, before the rule is even final, would be an unprecedented interference with EPA's efforts \nto fulfill its duties under the CAA. \n \nSince the CAA was enacted with bipartisan support in 1970, (and amended in 1977 and in 1990), \nthe economy has more than tripled in size while emissions of key pollutants have decreased by  nearly 70 percent.

Kinzinger, R-IL, and 19 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2666, the No Rate Regulation of \nBroadband Internet Access Act, which would undermine key provisions in the Federal \nCommunications Commission's (FCC) Open Internet order and harm the Commission's ability to \nprotect consumers while facilitating innovation and economic growth. \n \nFor almost a century, our laws have recognized that companies that connect Americans to the \nworld have special obligations not to exploit the gatekeeper power they enjoy over access in and \nout of our homes and businesses.  The same philosophy should guide any service that is based on \nthe transmission of information, whether a phone call or a packet of data.  The FCC's rules \u2014 \nissued after a lengthy rulemaking process that garnered an unprecedented amount of public input, \nincluding comments from four million Americans \u2014 recognize that broadband service is of the \nsame importance, and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do.  \nThese carefully-designed rules have already been implemented in large part with little or no \nadverse impact on the telecommunications companies making important investments in our \neconomy. \n \nH.R. 2666 is overly broad and extends far beyond codifying the FCC's forbearance from \napplying provisions of the Communications Act related to tariffs, rate approval, or other forms of \nutility regulation.  Even as amended, H.R. 2666 would restrict the FCC's ability to take \nenforcement actions to protect consumers on issues where the FCC has received numerous \nconsumer complaints.  The bill also would hamstring the FCC's public interest authority to \nreview transactions.  H.R. 2666 also could limit the Commission's ability to address new \npractices and adapt its rules for a dynamic, fast-changing online marketplace. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2666, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n     \n  March 3, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \n  H.R. 1029 \u2013 EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Lucas, R-OK and 24 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1029, which would affect the ability of EPA's Science \nAdvisory Board (SAB) to form panels and perform its essential functions.  The SAB, along with \nother functions, reviews the quality and adequacy of certain scientific and technical information \nused by EPA or proposed as the basis for EPA regulations.  Therefore, it is imperative that the \nSAB be composed of the most knowledgeable scientific and technical experts available.  The \nFederal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which governs Federal advisory committees such as \nthe SAB, provides for balanced panels and subcommittees that include experts with diverse \nbackgrounds who represent wide-ranging perspectives.  \n \nH.R. 1029 would negatively affect the appointment of experts and would weaken the scientific \nindependence and integrity of the SAB.  For example, the bill would impose a hiring quota for \nSAB members based on employment by a State, local, or tribal government as opposed to \nscientific expertise.  The bill would also place limitations on SAB members' participation in \n\"advisory activities that directly or indirectly involve review and evaluation of their own work.\"  \nDetermining the practical meaning of \"indirect\" involvement will be difficult and consequently \nproblematic to implement.  The provisions on appointment of experts to the SAB and various \nother requirements could also preclude the nomination of scientists with significant expertise in \ntheir fields.   \n \nIn addition, H.R. 1029 would add burdensome requirements on the SAB with respect to \nsolicitation of and response to public comments, above and beyond those imposed by FACA.  \nThese new requirements would saddle the SAB with workload that would impair its ability to \ncarry out its mandate.  Further, H.R. 1029 would add an unnecessary, burdensome, and costly \nlayer of requirements for hazard and risk assessments without defining the scope of these \nrequirements and absent recognition that many high profile assessments already are reviewed by \nthe SAB.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 1029, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n            ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nApril 18, 2016              \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4885 \u2013 IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending Act of 2016 \n(Rep. Smith, R-MO, and nine cosponsors)  \n   \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4885, the IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending \nAct of 2016, which would reduce the resources available for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nat a time when the IRS is severely underfunded.  By further constraining IRS resources, \nH.R. 4885 would have detrimental effects on the IRS's ability to provide quality service to \ntaxpayers, administer the tax code, and enforce tax laws.  \n \nH.R. 4885 would repeal the IRS's longstanding legal authority to offset the cost of providing \nservices to taxpayers with user fees.  The IRS has had this authority since 1995, and charges user \nfees for a variety of services.  Repealing this authority would reduce overall IRS resources by \nroughly 4 percent, compounding budget cuts that have left the IRS severely underfunded and \nreversing the limited progress the IRS has been able to make on taxpayer service levels this year \nafter receiving a modest funding increase in fiscal year 2016.  Even with this small increase, the \nIRS budget remains more than $900 million lower than it was in fiscal year 2010, before \nadjusting for inflation.  These cuts cost the Nation billions of dollars each year in lost tax revenue \nand have been enacted despite the IRS's crucial and growing responsibilities to implement new \nmandates and enhance cybersecurity protections.  \n \nThe IRS needs more resources, not fewer, to deter tax cheats, serve honest taxpayers, and protect \ntaxpayer data.  That is why the President's FY 2017 Budget would increase IRS funding by $530 \nmillion above the FY 2016 enacted level to protect the integrity of the tax system, fairly enforce \nthe tax code, and provide adequate levels of taxpayer services.  Unfortunately, H.R. 4885 would \ngo in the opposite direction, further reducing the resources available to the IRS and undermining \nthe fairness and integrity of the tax system in ways that would increase burdens on taxpayers, \nincluding by increasing the deficit. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4885, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nDecember 8, 2015 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2130 \u2013 Red River Private Property Protection Act \n(Rep.

Smith, R-MO, and 9 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, and \ntailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner.  The \nretrospective review of regulations has been an ongoing priority of this Administration.  Starting \nin 2011, the President institutionalized the retrospective review of regulations in Executive \nOrders 13563 and 13610, requiring agencies to report twice a year on the status of their \nefforts.  H.R. 1155, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily \nBurdensome Act, would make the process of retrospective regulatory review less productive.  \nFurther, the bill also would create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty; increase costs for \nbusinesses and State, local and tribal governments; and impede common-sense protections for \nthe American public.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. \n1155 in its current form.  \n \nAlthough outside input and perspective on what rules may be ripe for potential reform or repeal \nis crucial, retrospective review is most effective when led by the agencies.  The bill's creation of \na stand-alone commission to review the entire Code of Federal Regulations is likely to produce a \nhaphazard list of rules that, under the procedures in the bill, must be repealed if approved by a \njoint resolution.  There appears to be no mechanism for making thoughtful and modest \nmodifications to rules to improve their implementation and enforcement, which is often the best \ncourse of action for making regulations work better.  Moreover, the bill's \"cut-go\" approach is \nproblematic:  it would interfere with the ability of agencies to issue regulations that are essential \nfor the protection of public health, safety, and the environment.   \n \nThe Administration recognizes that the applicability of \"cut-go\" in H.R. 1155 is narrower than in \nother bills being considered in the Congress.  Nonetheless, it is essential that agencies have the \nflexibility to promptly issue new, vital rules.  This ability should not be constrained by a \nCommission's recommendation, or Congressional approval of a list of repealable rules.  While \nretrospective review is an Administration priority and an essential tool to relieve unnecessary \nregulatory burden, it is important that retrospective review efforts not unnecessarily constrain an \nagency's ability to provide a timely response to critical public health or safety issues, or constrain \nits ability to implement new statutory provisions. \n \nFor these reasons, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1155 in its current form.

Sensenbrenner, R-WI, and 10 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to addressing the opioid epidemic.  While the Administration \nwelcomes Congressional efforts to elevate the importance of combating the epidemic, the \nAdministration is greatly concerned that, without the resources necessary to prevent opioid \naddiction and increase access to treatment and recovery services, H.R. 4641, H.R. 5046, and \nrelated bills that may be considered simultaneously would do little to help the thousands of \nAmericans struggling with addiction. \n \nEvery day that passes without Congressional action to support the treatment needs of those \nsuffering from opioid use disorder is a missed opportunity to help the many communities facing \nthe prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.  Data from the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention show that opioids \u2013 a class of drugs that includes prescription opioid pain \nmedications and heroin \u2013 were involved in 28,647 deaths in 2014.  In addition to high rates of \nprescription opioid deaths, there have also been alarming increases in deaths from heroin and \nsynthetic opioids such as fentanyl.  In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for \nprescription opioids, which is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of \npills.  Further, four in five new heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioid pain \nmedications.  These trends will not change by simply authorizing new grant programs, studies \nand reports.  Congressional action is needed to fund the tools communities need to confront this \nepidemic and accelerate important policies like training health care providers on appropriate \nopioid prescribing, an essential component of this effort. \n \nIn February, the Administration submitted a robust proposal to the Congress to provide \n$1.1 billion in new funding to address this epidemic and expand access to treatment for \nprescription opioid abuse and heroin use to help individuals with an opioid use disorder seek \ntreatment, successfully complete treatment, and sustain recovery.  This funding also would \nsupport the placement of substance use disorder treatment providers in the communities most in \nneed, and would continue to build effective, evidence-based treatment programs.  The President's \nBudget builds on current efforts to expand prescription drug overdose prevention strategies, \nimprove access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, and support targeted enforcement \nactivities.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to secure the funding necessary \nto ensure that opioid use disorder treatment is available for those who seek it. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nJuly 11, 2016 \n \n(House Rules)\nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5538 \u2013 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  \nAppropriations Act, 2017 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5538, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending \nSeptember 30, 2017, and for other purposes. \n \nThe bill underfunds core Department of the Interior (DOI) programs as well as the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's (EPA) operating budget, which supports nationwide \nprotection of human health, and vital air, water and land resources.  The funding levels in the bill \nwould significantly hamper investments that reduce future costs to taxpayers by facilitating \nincreased energy development, ensuring adequate levels of cybersecurity, and maintaining \noperations, facilities and infrastructure in national parks, refuges, forests, public lands, and \nIndian Country.  These reductions would make it more difficult for States and businesses to plan \nand execute changes that would decrease carbon pollution and address the challenges facing the \nNation from climate change.  They would also reduce support for partnerships and effective \ncollaboration with States, Tribes, local governments, and private entities on efforts to restore and \nconserve natural and cultural resources.  Furthermore, the legislation includes numerous highly \nunacceptable provisions that have no place in funding legislation.  These provisions threaten to \nundermine the most basic protections for America's unique natural treasures and the people and \nwildlife that rely on them, as well as the ability of States and communities to address climate \nchange and protect a resource that is essential to America's health\u2014clean water. \n \nDespite these shortcomings, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in EPA's water \ninfrastructure financing programs, including the State Revolving Funds for clean water and \ndrinking water projects and the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act loan \nprogram.  In addition, the Administration appreciates the Committee's investments in Indian \nCountry, sagebrush ecosystem conservation, and National Park Service operations, though the \nCongress is encouraged to fully fund the requested increases in these areas.   \n \nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated \nfor FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense \nspending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class \nfamilies, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that \nagreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  \nHowever, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological \nprovisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.   \n  If the President were presented with H.R. 5538, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of the Interior (DOI) \n \nIndian Affairs Priorities.  The Administration appreciates the funding level for Indian Affairs \nprograms as a whole.  However, although the bill provides full funding for Contract Support \nCosts, and increases for the Tiwahe Initiative and important Indian Education programs, the bill \ndoes not include funding to address fundamental needs in Indian Country.  The bill fails to \nprovide for much needed basic access to broadband and digital services in Indian schools, \nadequately facilitate access to Federal programs through a Native One-Stop Support Center, or \nstrengthen data quality in Indian Country.  Further, it fails to help tribal communities manage \nnatural resources, prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change, and support \nresolution of tribal land and water claims. \n \nOil and Gas Inspection Fees.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not include \nthe FY 2017 Budget request to institute a new onshore oil and gas inspection fee program.  The \nprogram, which is similar to the program already in place for offshore operations, would cover \nthe cost of onshore inspection activities and reduce by $48 million the net cost to taxpayers of \noperating Bureau of Land Management's oil and gas program.  Failure to adopt the new fees and \nassociated funding would restrict BLM's ability to protect human safety, conserve energy \nresources, facilitate the proper reporting of oil and gas production, and ensure environmental \nrequirements are being followed in all phases of development.  The bill also fails to include a \nproposed change to the Bureau of Safety and Environment Enforcement's inspection fee \nstructure, which is necessary to ensure Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) operations are conducted \nsafely and responsibly.  \n \nPayments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT).  The Administration is disappointed that the bill includes \n$480 million in discretionary resources for PILT, which the FY 2017 Budget request funds \nthrough a separate mandatory appropriation.  Inclusion of these discretionary funds in the bill \ncomes at the expense of all other programs funded by the bill. \n \nRestrictions on the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  The Administration strongly opposes sections \n114, 118, 119, and 445 of the bill, which would undermine the ESA and limit the ability of the \nFish and Wildlife Service to properly protect important species and habitats based on the best \navailable science, including the greater sage grouse, lesser prairie chicken, delta smelt, and \ncertain gray wolf populations.  Notably, the bill would circumvent established law, Federal \nprocess, and in some cases, judicial precedent.  These language provisions would create \nuncertainty and undermine unprecedented efforts to collaboratively conserve landscapes in \nconcert with local ways of life.  Furthermore, the Administration strongly opposes sections 447 \nthrough 451 of the bill regarding management of water flows in California which would undercut \nthe ESA, preempt California water law, fail to address critical elements of California's complex \nwater challenges and impede an effective and timely response to the continuing drought while \nproviding no additional water to hard hit communities.  These provisions could slow decision-\nmaking, generate significant litigation, and limit real-time operational flexibility critical to \nmaximizing water delivery.  As the Administration stated in the past, these provisions were \n2  developed with little input from the public, the Administration, or key stakeholders affected by \nthe drought.  The urgency and seriousness of the California drought requires a balanced and \nflexible approach that promotes water reliability and ecosystem restoration.  \n \nStream Protection Rule.  The Administration strongly opposes section 120 of the bill, which \nwould prohibit the DOI's Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement (OSMRE) \nfrom finalizing or implementing the proposed Stream Protection Rule.  This rule would update \n30-year old stream protection regulations to reflect modern science and technology and better \nprotect people and the environment, provide industry more certainty, and address recent court \ndecisions.  The current stream protection requirements governing surface mining activities rely on \noutdated scientific knowledge and mining and reclamation techniques.  The bill's attempt to block \nmodern, science-based regulations would significantly impair the ability of OSMRE to \naccomplish the mission and responsibilities the Congress laid out in the Surface Mining Control \nand Reclamation Act of 1977, including preserving clean water and protecting human health and \nthe environment.  In addition, the bill would undermine environmental protections, prevent the \nrestoration of hundreds of streams, result in the deterioration of water quality for thousands of \nstream miles, create sustained regulatory uncertainty, and negatively impact public health for \ndownstream communities.  \n \nOil, Gas, and Coal Operations.  The Administration strongly opposes sections 122, 127, 440, \nand 441 of the bill which would undermine BLM's basic administrative authority to effectively \noversee onshore fossil energy production on public lands.  Section 122 of the bill would prohibit \nBLM from regulating flaring, venting and leaks of methane from Federal onshore oil and gas \noperations; this effectively prevents BLM from using Mineral Leasing Act authority to reduce \nwaste and improve fair return to the tax payer.  Section 440 of the bill infringes upon BLM's \nauthority to adjust royalty rates where appropriate.  In addition, section 441 of the bill short-\ncircuits the Administration's recently-announced comprehensive review of the Federal coal \nleasing program, thus impeding the Administration's ability to ensure a fair return to taxpayers \nfrom Federal coal development.  Section 127 of the bill prevents the Bureau of Ocean Energy \nManagement from finalizing a rule on the air quality impacts from OCS oil and gas operations.  \n \nBureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) Offshore Well Control Rule.  The \nAdministration strongly opposes section 124 of the bill, which prohibits BSEE from developing, \nadopting, implementing, administering, or enforcing requirements pertaining to drilling safety \nmargins, which represent a key provision of the BSEE's recently finalized Well Control Rule \naddressing drilling safety on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.  This prohibition would \nfundamentally undermine BSEE's role in overseeing OCS oil and gas operations, including efforts \nto reduce the risk of a catastrophic loss of well control such as the one that led to the 2010 \nDeepwater Horizon oil spill.  In addition, the rescission of BSEE's unobligated balances would \nprevent BSEE from meeting its safety and environmental protection responsibilities on behalf of \nthe American public. \n \nNational Monument Restrictions.  The Administration strongly opposes section 453 of the bill, \nwhich would prohibit the President from exercising his authority under the Antiquities Act to \ndesignate national monuments in certain counties within eight States.  This would debilitate a \nsuccessful program that has been used to protect areas critical to the Nation's natural and cultural \nheritage such as Bandelier National Monument and the Statue of Liberty. \n \nBLM Planning 2.0.  The Administration strongly opposes section 443 of the bill, which would \n3  significantly delay BLM from promulgating, implementing, or enforcing its Planning 2.0 \nrulemaking to improve BLM's land use planning.  This delay would prevent BLM from \nfinalizing a rule that supports Administration goals of facilitating science-based, landscape-level \nplanning with early public involvement. \n \nHunting, Fishing, and Recreational Shooting.  The Administration strongly opposes limits on the \nclosure of land management areas to hunting, which infringe upon the authority of BLM's field \nmanagers and fail to provide the public sufficient time or flexibility to develop effective long-\nterm solutions at the local level to address long-term resource conflicts, resource protection \nneeds, and public safety issues associated with recreational target shooting. \n \nWater Rights.  The Administration strongly opposes section 433 of the bill, which would restrict \nthe use of funds to implement water rights administration and management by the Federal \nGovernment.  This language is unnecessary for its intended purpose, and would preclude land \nmanagement agencies from protecting the public interest.  This provision would eliminate the \nability of land management agencies to maintain sufficient water for other congressionally-\ndesignated purposes and ensure water rights are tied to the activities for which they were \ndeveloped.  These restrictions would also hamper cooperative work with land users to improve \nland conditions, such as range improvements, or conduct habitat mitigation activities as part of \nland use agreements. \n \nNational Historic Preservation Act.  The Administration opposes section 123 of the bill, which \nwould allow Federal agencies to object to a designation of Federal properties for inclusion on the \nNational Register of Historic Places.  Listing a property on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces, or designating it as a National Historic Landmark, does not limit any Federal agency's \ndecision-making authority.  Decisions on how to manage the property, informed by the \nevaluation of its significance and integrity, remain the responsibility of the agency with \njurisdiction over that property.  The Administration is not aware of any specific instance where \nsuch a designation has adversely affected national security.  Enactment of this section could lead \nto a fundamental weakening of highly successful and widely admired programs that recognize \nand protect the Nation's shared heritage. \n \nFederal Acknowledgement of American Indian Tribes Rule.  The Administration opposes section \n125 of the bill, which would block DOI from implementing, administering, or enforcing the final \nFederal acknowledgment rule.  The final rule makes much needed changes to the previous rules \ncriticized by Tribes and the Congress as in need of reform.  These important changes were made \nin consultation with and at the request of Tribes, States, local governments, and the public.  \nBlocking this rule leaves the Federal acknowledgement program without a governing structure, \neffectively halting the Administration's role in the process.  To uphold the principle of tribal \nsovereignty, it is important that the Federal Government have a clear and objective process to \ndetermine which Tribes it recognizes.  Administrative recognition provides an orderly process. \n \nLand into Trust.  The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to address the need to \nclarify and reaffirm the Secretary of the Interior's authority to acquire land in trust under the \nIndian Reorganization Act (IRA).  In Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 397 (2009), the Supreme \nCourt held that the Secretary could acquire land in trust under IRA only for Tribes that were \n\"under Federal jurisdiction\" in 1934.  The Administration continues to support language requested \nin the FY 2017 Budget to extend this authority to all Tribes, whether recognized in 1934 or later.  \nSuch legislation would be consistent with the longstanding policy of assisting Tribes in \n4  establishing and protecting a land base sufficient to allow them to provide for the health, welfare, \nand safety of tribal members, and in treating all Tribes equally for purposes of setting aside lands \nfor tribal communities.  Section 128 of the bill takes a far more limited approach, however, simply \nreaffirming that certain land taken into trust before the Carcieri decision shall continue to be trust \nland. \n \nDOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service \n \nWildland Fire Suppression.  The Administration is deeply disappointed that the Committee did \nnot take a stronger position toward the enactment of a cap adjustment for wildfire suppression in \nthis bill, and instead, focused on the inclusion of a provision that is potentially disruptive of the \nenvironmental analysis required under the National Environmental Policy Act.  The \nAdministration's cap adjustment proposal is a fiscally responsible strategy to provide \ndiscretionary resources for suppression of 98 percent of wildland fires with 70 percent of the 10-\nyear average cost in base appropriations.  This includes a disaster funding cap adjustment to meet \nsuppression needs for the remaining two percent of fires that become catastrophic in size and \ncost and consume 30 percent of suppression resources.  Continued inaction on this proposal, \nwhich has bipartisan support, would increase the likelihood of disruptive fire transfers in future \nyears and harm all other Forest Service Programs.  Passage of the proposal is of paramount \nconcern for the Administration in order to protect programs that pre-emptively reduce fire risk \nand future fire costs by restoring the health of forests and watersheds. \n \nLand and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).  The Administration objects to the drastic reduction \nof $129 million, or 27 percent, from the discretionary funding requested in the FY 2017 Budget \nfor DOI and USDA LWCF programs.  LWCF is a cornerstone of Federal conservation and \nrecreation conservation efforts.  This funding level would severely impede agency capacity to \nfurther protect the Nation's natural heritage.  To date, LWCF has contributed to the protection of \nkey public lands, such as Olympic National Park, Everglades National Park, and important assets \nin the Chesapeake Bay watershed, among others, as well as State and local recreation projects and \nimportant cultural heritage sites. \n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n \nOperating Budget.  The Administration strongly opposes the $399 million reduction of EPA's \noperating budget, or 11 percent, compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  This unacceptable \nreduction in funding would significantly undermine key actions to address climate change and \nimprove air quality.  In particular, the bill would inhibit EPA's ability to implement commonsense \nstandards and voluntary programs, provide timely guidance and technical assistance to State and \ntribal air agencies, improve flexibility and enhance partnership with the States, support \ncommunities in efforts to combat localized effects of air pollution, and continue making progress \ntoward eliminating the State implementation plan backlog.  Further, this funding level would \nsignificantly reduce EPA's ability to enforce and oversee critical environmental protections for air, \nwater, and land, including decreased capacity to find and develop civil and criminal cases against \ncompanies and individuals responsible for contaminating the environment.  The funding level \nwould also severely hinder EPA's work to strengthen environmental planning efforts, educate the \npublic about environmental risks, and address pollution in underserved communities.  These \nreductions would also hamper some of EPA's critical geographic program efforts, including those \nin the Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound, and Southern New England Estuaries.  In addition, \nreductions to EPA's cybersecurity funding would severely impede EPA's ability to take necessary \n5  action to protect, defend, and sustain vital information and records, including personal \ninformation. \n \nState Categorical Grants.  The Administration opposes the $100 million reduction to the State \nand Tribal Categorical Grants account compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  Often, States \nand Tribes implement environmental programs through delegated authorities.  However, the bill \nreduces these grants to States and Tribes, severely limiting their ability to carry out activities \nsuch as water quality permitting, air monitoring, and hazardous waste management programs.  \nFor example, the bill reduces funding for environmental information grants by $16 million, or  \n62 percent, compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduction would hamper system \nmodernizations through the E-Enterprise approach and the efficiencies and long-term cost \nsavings they would bring for many of the tools needed by industry and the States, as well as ease \nof use by the public.  In addition, the bill reduces funding for brownfields projects by $10 million \ncompared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduced level of funding severely restricts \nopportunities for communities to revitalize their contaminated lands to improve environmental \nquality and spark economic redevelopment. \n \ne-Manifest.  The Administration objects to the reduction of funding for e-Manifest development, \nEPA's system for electronically tracking the transport of hazardous waste.  While the \nAdministration acknowledges the concern about the pace of development of e-Manifest, full \nfunding in FY 2017 is essential to finishing the system in time for a planned launch in calendar \nyear 2018. \n \nOil Spill Prevention and Preparedness.  The bill fails to recognize the risks associated with the \nincreased production of domestic oil resources by failing to provide the necessary increases for \ninspections, training, and compliance offered through the Inland Oil Spills Programs Account. \n \nHazardous Substance Superfund.  The Administration objects to the reductions made to the \nHazardous Substance Superfund Account.  These programs ensure that polluters pay for the \ncontamination they caused before that burden is unfairly levied upon the general tax payer, fund \ncleanup activities where no viable responsible party has been identified, and provide oversight \nand assistance to Federal agencies who are actively engaged in cleaning up sites they own or \noperate.  Robust funding within the account is necessary to protect the public and address the \nrelease of hazardous substances.  \n \nGreenhouse Gas Limits for Power Plants.  The Administration strongly objects to section 431 of \nthe bill, which would block the Clean Power Plan as well as carbon pollution standards for power \nplants promulgated under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act.  Although the Clean Power Plan is \ncurrently stayed pending judicial review, this provision seeks to derail this critical component of \nthe Administration's efforts to combat climate change regardless of the outcome of judicial \nreview.  The Administration is confident the Clean Power Plan will be upheld when the courts \naddress its merits because the Plan rests on strong scientific and legal foundations. \n \nClean Water Act (CWA) Jurisdiction.  The Administration believes that the CWA provisions in \nthe bill undermine efforts to protect America's water resources, which are critical to the health of \nAmerican families and businesses.  The Administration strongly objects to section 427 in \nparticular, which would disrupt the Administration's current efforts, and prevent future efforts, to \nclarify the scope of CWA.  This would result in significant ambiguity and regulatory uncertainty \nfor the public. \n6   \nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards Ozone Rule.  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 438 of the bill, which would delay and undermine implementation of the 2015 ozone \nhealth standard.  Ozone pollution, also known as smog, has been linked to a range of adverse \nhealth effects that can lead to missed work and school days, increased hospital admissions, and \npremature deaths from respiratory and cardiovascular causes.  This provision would result in \npeople living in areas with unhealthy ozone levels for additional years, delaying health benefits \nworth billions of dollars for millions of Americans, including the most vulnerable\u2014children, \nolder adults, and people with asthma.  EPA's science-based air standards, which undergo \nrigorous public review and comment, have a proven record of success.  The standards have \nresulted in cleaner air which has helped all Americans live longer, healthier lives in a growing \neconomy. \n \nOil and Gas Methane Emissions Standards.  The Administration strongly objects to section 439 \nof the bill, which would block commonsense standards for sources of emissions of methane, \nvolatile organic compounds, and toxic pollutants in the oil and natural gas industry.  Methane is \n25 times more potent than carbon dioxide, and is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas \nemitted in the United States from human activities.  Not only is reducing these emissions an \nessential component of the Administration's efforts to combat climate change, emission reductions \nwould also have meaningful public health benefits for Americans.  This provision would also \nprevent EPA from providing valuable and much needed technical guidance on emissions control \ntechniques to State, tribal, and local air agencies in moderate or above nonattainment ground-level \nozone areas and the ozone transport region.  It would also prevent EPA from clarifying the scope \nof an emissions source to provide greater certainty for the regulated community, permitting \nauthorities, and the public. \n \nSocial Cost of Carbon (SCC).  The Administration regards the SCC as an essential component of \nthe rulemaking process and opposes the Congress's interference with the Interagency Working \nGroup's (IWG) development of the SCC.  The Administration strongly objects to section 436 of \nthe bill, which would force the IWG to revise the SCC using only a limited set of discount rates \nand \"domestic\" SCC values.  This revision ignores the trans-boundary movement of carbon and \nclimate impacts, fails to capture key costs of carbon emissions, and disrupts upcoming rules that \nwould use the SCC to monetize carbon reduction benefits. \n \nLimitations on Significant New Alternatives Policy under the Clean Air Act.  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 434 of the bill, which would block the finalization, implementation, \nand enforcement of a rule to prohibit certain uses of climate super-pollutants known as \nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).  Domestic action to reduce use of HFCs is consistent with U.S. \nadvocacy for addressing HFCs on a global basis, such as through an amendment to the Montreal \nProtocol. \n \nClassification of Forest Biomass Fuels as Carbon-Neutral.  The Administration recognizes the \nrole that biomass can play in reducing overall net carbon emissions in the United States, \nincluding in the implementation of the Clean Power Plan.  The EPA and its Science Advisory \nBoard are assessing the net biogenic carbon emissions associated with the use of different \nbiomass feedstocks for energy.  The Administration strongly objects to language under the \nheading \"Administrative Provisions\u2014Environmental Protection Agency\" in the bill, which \nwould compel EPA to disregard the scientific recommendations of its own Science Advisory \nBoard and other technical studies. \n7   \nPesticide Worker Protection Information Access.  The Administration strongly objects to section \n437, which would prevent implementation or enforcement of a recently published pesticide \nworker protection regulation, a commonsense measure that allows a worker or handler's \ndesignated representative to access required safety and hazard information for pesticides to \nwhich that worker may have been exposed.  This provision unacceptably reduces at-risk \nindividuals' access to critical job safety information. \n \nAquifer Exemptions.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill under the heading \n\"Administrative Provisions\u2014Environmental Protection Agency,\" which would preclude EPA \nfrom revising its regulatory criteria for aquifer exemptions involving underground injection.  \nThis provision is in conflict with existing EPA regulations and guidance, and would cause results \ninconsistent with the intent of the Safe Drinking Water Act by preventing EPA from being able \nto protect some underground sources of drinking water. \n \nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) \n108(b) Financial Assurance.  The Administration objects to section 430 of the bill, which \nprohibits the use of funds to develop, propose, finalize, and implement financial responsibility \nrequirements under CERCLA 108(b).  This provision severely limits EPA's ability to comply \nwith the court order, abrogates EPA's responsibilities laid out in CERCLA 108(b), and passes the \ncost of future cleanup activities from the polluter to the taxpayer. \n \nLead Test Kits.  The Administration objects to section 429 of the bill, which would potentially \ndisrupt EPA's current activities under the 2008 Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting rule until \neither EPA approves a commercially available \"improved\" lead paint test kit or solicits public \ncomment on alternatives to current testing options.  Children and developing fetuses are \nespecially sensitive to lead exposure, and EPA's efforts to protect vulnerable populations during \nhome renovation projects would be undermined. \n \nDepartment of Health and Human Services \n \nIndian Health Service (IHS).  The Administration strongly supports increased investment in IHS \nand commends the Committee for funding health care services for American Indians and Alaska \nNatives.  However, the Administration is concerned that the funding provided for IHS is $106 \nmillion below the FY 2017 Budget request.  These additional funds are needed to provide critical \nprogram increases to help close the gap in health disparities experienced by American Indians \nand Alaska Natives.  The Administration also is concerned that section 446 would create new \nimproper governance structures for IHS facilities. \n \nContract Support Costs.  The Administration opposes changes made by the bill to the IHS \nContract Support Costs account that removes a proviso allowing IHS to credit a contract support \ncost overpayment against contract support costs due in subsequent fiscal years.  Without this \nlanguage, IHS would need to collect contract support cost overpayments from Tribes at the end \nof each fiscal year.  This process would be overly burdensome for both IHS and Tribes. \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nSmithsonian Institution.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Smithsonian's \nrequest.  In particular, the reductions to the Salaries and Expenses account could force the \nSmithsonian to reduce programmatic activities and museum access for the public in order to cover \n8  growing fixed costs. \n \nOther Issues \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the \nCongress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOI and EPA to implement the DATA \nAct.  This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as \nupdating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and \nFederal award data with the Award ID. \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 \nBudget request for DOI and EPA to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding supports \nefforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n9  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nMay 14, 2015 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nSenate Amendments to H.R. 1314 - Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and \nAccountability Act of 2015 and Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015  \n(Sen. Hatch, R-UT) \nThe Administration strongly supports enactment of the Senate Amendments to H.R. 1314, the \nBipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 and the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015.  Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is a vital \ntool for enabling the United States to expand economic opportunities, break down barriers, and \nestablish global economic rules that support strong and enforceable standards that promote \nworkers\u2019 rights, the environment, and a free and open Internet.  U.S. exports support more than \n11 million American jobs, which, on average, pay up to 18 percent more than jobs in other \nindustries.  Enacting TPA will help America take another step toward delivering trade \nagreements that not only open new markets to \u2018Made in America\u2019 goods, but also level the \nplaying field consistent with the Nation\u2019s values and priorities.  \nThis multi-title bill would grant TPA to support the negotiation of high-standard trade \nagreements that are good for the U.S. economy, businesses, farmers, innovators and workers, and \nwould extend and enhance the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program.  The bill makes \nimportant updates to U.S. negotiating objectives that will promote human rights, facilitate digital \ntrade, address state-owned enterprises, tackle localization barriers, and address currency issues in \ntrade agreements subject to the bill.  The Senate Amendments to H.R. 1314 also provide a \nsignificant increase in the requirements for consultation, transparency, and accountability with \nCongress, stakeholders, and the public regarding such agreements.  Additionally, the bill will \nensure that the United States will continue to maintain the highest level of health, safety, \nconsumer, environmental, labor, and financial protections that ensure Federal, State and local \ngovernments continue to have the right to regulate in the public interest.   \nThe Senate Amendments to H.R. 1314 regarding TAA are an important partner to TPA, and \nwould provide employment-related services and benefits to American workers and firms, helping \nall Americans participate in the global economy.  By providing income support, job training, re-\nemployment services, and other services, TAA would help trade-impacted workers enter new \nindustries and careers and would give firms access to the tools they need to compete.  In addition \nto extending TAA services for American workers and firms, this bill would reinstate key \nprovisions from the 2009 and 2011 TAA reauthorizations that were regrettably allowed to expire.  \nFor example, the bill would expand coverage to again include service sector workers and \nworkers whose jobs have shifted to China, India, and other countries.  Reinstatement and \nreauthorization of the TAA expansion provisions first enacted in 2009 would significantly \nincrease the number of workers who have access to TAA benefits.  It would provide up to 130 \nweeks of Trade Readjustment Allowance benefits, restore case management and employment \nservices and the enhanced older worker wage supplement program, and maintain job search and \nrelocation assistance.  It also would raise the annual cap for job training and other activities to \n$450 million per year \u2013 from the $220 million annual training cap under current law.  The  Administration looks forward to working with Congress to secure the needed resources to \neffectively implement and administer a reinstated Health Coverage Tax Credit.    \n \nThe Administration also looks forward to providing technical assistance as necessary and \ncontinuing to work with Congress on successful passage and implementation on this important \nlegislation.     \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nNovember 3, 2015 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS.J.Res. 22 \u2013 Disapproving EPA/Army Rule on Waters of the United States \n(Sen. Ernst, R-IA, and 49 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes S.J.Res. 22, which would nullify a specified Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army (Army) final rule clarifying the \njurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The agencies' rulemaking, grounded in \nscience and the law, is essential to ensure clean water for future generations, and is responsive to \ncalls for rulemaking from the Congress, industry, and community stakeholders as well as \ndecisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The final rule has been through an extensive public \nengagement process.  \n \nClean water is vital for the success of the Nation's businesses, agriculture, energy development, \nand the health of our communities.  More than one in three Americans get their drinking water \nfrom rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that are at risk of pollution from upstream sources.  The \nprotection of wetlands is also vital for hunting and fishing.  When Congress passed the CWA in \n1972 to restore the Nation's waters, it recognized that to have healthy communities downstream, \nwe need to protect the smaller streams and wetlands upstream.   \n  \nClarifying the scope of the CWA helps to protect clean water, safeguard public health, and \nstrengthen the economy.  Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 focused on specific \njurisdictional determinations and rejected the analytical approach that the Army Corps of \nEngineers used for those determinations, but did not invalidate the underlying regulation.  This \nhas created ongoing questions and uncertainty about how the regulation is applied consistent \nwith the Court's decisions.  The final rule was developed to address this uncertainty and it should \nremain in place.   \n \nIf enacted, S.J.Res. 22 would nullify years of work and deny businesses and communities the \nregulatory certainty needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water.  EPA and Army have \nsought the views of and listened carefully to the public throughout the extensive public \nengagement process for this rule.   \n \nSimply put, S.J.Res. 22 is not an act of good governance.  It would sow confusion and invite \nconflict at a time when our communities and businesses need clarity and certainty around clean \nwater regulation.   \n \nIf the President were presented with S.J.Res. 22, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nApril 12, 2016 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3340 \u2013 Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act \n(Rep. Emmer, R-MN, and 15 cosponsors)  \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3340, the Financial Stability \nOversight Council Reform Act, which seeks to subject the Financial Stability Oversight Council \n(FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR) to Congressional appropriations.  The bill \nalso would require the OFR to submit quarterly reports to the Congress regarding its activities \nand to provide a public notice and comment period of at least 90 days before issuing any report, \nrule, or regulation.  Subjecting these bodies to Congressional appropriations would hinder their \nindependence and could limit their ability to monitor and address threats to financial stability.   \n \nThe Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform) created FSOC to \nbring independent regulators together with a collective responsibility for monitoring risks across \nthe system, wherever they may arise, and to identify and respond to emerging threats to financial \nstability.  Before FSOC, no single entity was accountable for monitoring and responding to risks \nto financial stability.  Similarly, the OFR plays a unique role in promoting financial stability by \nidentifying and filling in gaps in data and knowledge about the financial system, monitoring \nfinancial stability metrics across the system, conducting independent research on financial \nstability policies and providing FSOC with data and analytical support.   \n \nWall Street Reform provided FSOC and the OFR with permanent funding through assessments \non the largest financial institutions, including bank holding companies with total consolidated \nassets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal \nReserve Board of Governors.  This funding system ensures that large financial institutions bear \nthe costs of protecting financial stability.  Maintaining a funding source independent of political \ninterference allows FSOC and the OFR to function at full capacity and focus on threats to \nfinancial stability.  Moreover, funding FSOC and the OFR through appropriations would subject \nthese entities to political gamesmanship that could hinder their ability to conduct independent \nresearch, ask questions, and analyze information about industries, firms, or activities \u2014 running \nthe risk of ignoring the next threat to financial stability.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3340, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nMay 17, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4974 \u2013 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2017 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on H.R. 4974, making appropriations \nfor military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal \nyear (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes. \n \nThe Administration welcomes the bill's investments in military infrastructure, housing, and \nservices for men and women in our Armed Forces and their families.  In addition, the \nAdministration appreciates the Committee's commitment to fund the benefits and services our \nveterans have earned, and provide the requested advanced appropriations.  However, the bill \ndoes not fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), \nand includes objectionable restrictions on performance awards for VA Senior Executive Service \ncivil servants.  In addition, the Administration strongly objects to the bill's unwarranted \nrestrictions on the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States \nto house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, as these restrictions \nfurther impede the Executive Branch's efforts to responsibly close the facility.  \n \nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated \nfor FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense \nspending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class \nfamilies, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that \nagreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  \nHowever, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological \nprovisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the final bill that is presented to \nthe President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nMilitary Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the \nDepartment of Defense's military construction and family housing requirements. \n \nDetainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to section 512 of the bill, which prohibits \nthe use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house \nindividuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This provision would constrain the \nflexibility that the Executive Branch needs to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees,  based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  The \nAdministration also objects to section 136 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to carry \nout realignment of the U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay.  While this provision is intended to \npreserve U.S. control of the U.S. Naval Station, it may restrict the Administration's ability to \nrelocate the functions and civilian personnel positions in support of the detainee mission. \n \nVeterans Affairs Funding.  The Administration objects to the $1.5 billion reduction from the \nFY 2017 Budget request for VA, including a decrease of $1.2 billion from the request for \nMedical Care.  This reduction would negatively impact veterans' access to medical care and \nreduce VA's ability to maintain medical facility infrastructure and activate new and replacement \nfacilities with sufficient staff and equipment.  In addition, the bill does not include the request for \ngeneral transfer authority, which would provide VA needed funding flexibility to address high \npriority needs. \n \nVeterans Affairs Senior Executive Service (SES) Performance Award Restrictions.  The \nAdministration objects to section 237 of the bill, which would prohibit performance awards for \nVA SES civil servants.  This provision would decrease morale among VA's workforce, \ndisadvantage high-performing SES employees, and could prevent VA from attracting and \nretaining top talent committed to serving veterans. \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration \nappreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for VA to implement \nthe DATA Act.  This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, \nsuch as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking \nfinancial and Federal award data with the Award ID. \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.

Hatch, R-UT) \nThe Administration strongly supports enactment of the Senate Amendments to H.R. 1295, the \nTrade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, which would extend the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act (AGOA), the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and the preferential \nduty treatment program for Haiti.  \nAGOA is the cornerstone of our economic relationship with sub-Saharan Africa, and a seamless, \nlong-term renewal of the program improves the environment for investment, two-way trade, \ndevelopment, and economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa.  The Administration welcomes a 10-\nyear extension of the program, including of the third-country fabric provisions.  This will give \nbuyers the certainty they need to build local supply chains and consider Africa as a destination \nfor investment and a source for their purchases.  The Administration is also pleased that the bill \nincludes changes that will improve implementation of the program, such as streamlined rules of \norigin and updates to the process to review country eligibility. \nIn addition to extending AGOA, the bill also renews the GSP program through December 31, \n2017.  GSP promotes economic growth in the developing world by eliminating duties on a wide \nrange of products from developing countries.  GSP also supports U.S. jobs by lowering the cost \nof imported inputs, which helps to keep U.S. manufacturers competitive, and reduces prices on \nmany U.S. consumer goods.  The legislation also designates certain cotton articles for potential \nduty-free treatment under the GSP program for least-developed countries, pursuant to \nundertakings by the United States in the World Trade Organization.   \nThe bill also extends the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership \nEncouragement Act (HOPE II) for five years, from 2020 to 2025.  Haiti remains the poorest \ncountry in the Americas, and one of the poorest in the world, with a significant need for basic \nservices.  The HOPE program has been instrumental in economic development in Haiti, \nespecially in the textile and apparel sector.  Early extension of this program will provide the \nstability and continuity needed to help ensure that companies will continue to invest in Haiti\u2019s \nfuture.   \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n) \n  July 28, 2015 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1994 \u2013 VA Accountability Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Jeff Miller, R-FL, and 98 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1994, as amended by the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs \nCommittee.  While the Administration believes strongly that Federal employees must be held \naccountable for their performance and actions, H.R. 1994 fails to provide tools to further that \ngoal, and in fact would be counterproductive for the reasons expressed below.  \n \nThe bill compiles a number of separate personnel policy bills aimed solely at the Department of \nVeterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) workforce, creating a disparity in the treatment of one group of career \ncivil servants.  The centerpiece of the bill is a provision that allows a VA employee to be \nremoved from Federal service or demoted without the opportunity to appeal that decision to the \nfull Merit Systems Protection Board.  An employee who has been removed or demoted under \nthis provision is instead subject to an abbreviated review process before an administrative law \njudge that may in some cases deprive employees of any appellate review whatsoever.  These \nprovisions remove important rights, protections, and incentives which are available to the vast \nmajority of Federal employees in other agencies across the Government and are essential to \nensure that Federal employees are afforded due process.  Other provisions of the bill, such as \nthose that would mandate rotation of VA Senior Executive employees every five years or impose \narbitrary restrictions on performance ratings provided to VA Senior Executives, would also be \ndisruptive and would hinder VA\u2019s ability to function effectively on behalf of veterans. \n \nUnder current law, Federal employees, including VA employees, may be terminated for a variety \nof reasons, ranging from absence without leave and inability to maintain performance standards \nto serious offenses such as falsification of records, misuse of government property, or sexual \nharassment.  While VA supports authority permitting efficient removal of employees who have \nengaged in misconduct, this bill will have unintended consequences.  It would make conditions \nof employment in VA significantly less attractive than in other Federal agencies or in the private \nsector, and as a result, would discourage outstanding VA employees from remaining in VA and \ndramatically impair VA\u2019s ability to recruit top talent, including veterans.  Currently, VA\u2019s Office \nof the Inspector General, Office of the Medical Inspector, and the newly established Office of \nAccountability Review provide strong oversight independent of its field organizations.  \n \nThe legislation raises serious concerns under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  \nIt could also raise concerns under the Due Process Clause depending upon its application.

McConnell, R-KY, and 47 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes S.J.Res. 23, which would undermine the public health \nprotections of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and stop critical U.S. efforts to reduce dangerous carbon \npollution from power plants.  In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the CAA gives the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) \npollution.  In 2009, EPA determined that GHG pollution threatens Americans' health and welfare \nby leading to long-lasting changes to the climate that can, and are already, having a range of \nnegative effects on human health and the environment.  This finding is consistent with \nconclusions of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, and numerous other national and international scientific bodies.  Power plants account \nfor roughly one-third of all domestic GHG emissions.  While the United States limits dangerous \nemissions of arsenic, mercury, lead, particulate matter, and ozone precursor pollution from \npower plants, the Carbon Pollution Standards and the Clean Power Plan put into place the first \nnational limits on power plant carbon pollution.  The Carbon Pollution Standards will ensure that \nnew, modified, and reconstructed power plants deploy available systems of emission reduction to \nreduce carbon pollution.  \n  \nS.J.Res. 23 would nullify carbon pollution standards for future power plants and power plants \nundertaking significant modifications or reconstruction, thus slowing our country's transition to \ncleaner, cutting-edge power generation technologies.  Most importantly, the resolution could \nenable continued build-out of outdated, high-polluting, and long-lived power generation \ninfrastructure and impede efforts to reduce carbon pollution from new and modified power \nplants \u2013 when the need to act, and to act quickly, to mitigate climate change impacts on \nAmerican communities has never been more clear. \n  \nSince it was enacted in 1970, and amended in 1977 and 1990, each time with strong bipartisan \nsupport, the CAA has improved the Nation's air quality and protected public health. Over that \nsame period of time, the economy has tripled in size while emissions of key pollutants have \ndecreased by more than 70 percent.  Forty-five years of clean air regulation have shown that a \nstrong economy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand. \n  \nBecause S.J.Res. 23 threatens the health and economic welfare of future generations by blocking \nimportant standards to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector that take a flexible, \ncommon sense approach to addressing carbon pollution, if the President were presented with \nS.J.Res. 23, he would veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nMarch 14, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4596 \u2013 Small Business Broadband Deployment Act \n(Rep.

These bills would impose unnecessary constraints on the Internal \nRevenue Service's (IRS) operations without improving the agency's ability to administer the tax \ncode and serve taxpayers. \n \nH.R. 1206 would prohibit the IRS from hiring any new employees until the Secretary of the \nTreasury certifies that no IRS employee has a seriously delinquent debt, or provides a report to \nthe Congress that includes an explanation of why certification is not possible and what would be \nrequired to provide such a certification. The bill could result in the IRS being prohibited from \nhiring any new employees for any purpose \u2013 a drastic and counterproductive step that would \ncompromise tax administration and taxpayer services.  The bill is also unworkable in operation, \nas \"seriously delinquent\" debts could be as low as $1 and tax liens are recorded on a case-by-case \nbasis.  This legislation is unnecessary, as strong laws and procedures already exist to ensure that \nIRS employees comply with their tax obligations.  Publicly-available data show that IRS \nemployees are among the most tax compliant groups in the Nation with a delinquency rate of less \nthan 1 percent.   \n \nH.R. 4890 would ban performance awards to IRS employees until the Secretary of the Treasury \ndevelops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy.  This bill is unnecessary, \nas the IRS has already developed and has begun to execute a strategy to improve taxpayer \nservices.  The real constraint on the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers effectively is severe \nunderfunding, including for taxpayer services.  IRS funding is more than $900 million below its \n2010 level, before adjusting for inflation.  These budget cuts have impeded the IRS's ability to \nserve taxpayers, including inadequate responses to taxpayer calls and correspondence.  Filing \nseason statistics show that taxpayer service has improved this year as a result of a small funding \nincrease provided last year, but more resources are needed to serve all taxpayers effectively and \nefficiently.  Legislation constraining the IRS's ability to retain and recruit highly qualified \nemployees is not needed and could be counterproductive to the Service's mission. \n \nH.R. 3724 would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily separated \ndue to misconduct.  The bill as written could force the immediate termination of employees who \nhad been terminated and rehired many years ago, even if their performance since rehiring has \nbeen blemish-free.  The bill's prohibition is also unnecessary because current IRS processes  already ensure the agency does not rehire former employees who had significant conduct or \nperformance problems during prior employment with the agency.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n \nJune 14, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5293 \u2013 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5293, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other \npurposes.   \n \nWhile the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for certain investments in our \nnational defense, H.R. 5293 fails to provide our troops with the resources needed to keep our \nNation safe.  At a time when ISIL continues to threaten the homeland and our allies, the bill does \nnot fully fund wartime operations such as INHERENT RESOLVE.  Instead the bill would \nredirect $16 billion of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds toward base budget \nprograms that the Department of Defense (DOD) did not request, shortchanging funding for \nongoing wartime operations midway through the year.  Not only is this approach dangerous but it \nis also wasteful.  The bill would buy excess force structure without the money to sustain it, \neffectively creating a hollow force structure that would undermine DOD's efforts to restore \nreadiness.  Furthermore, the bill's funding approach attempts to unravel the dollar-for-dollar \nbalance of defense and non-defense funding increases provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of \n2015 (BBA), threatening future steps needed to reverse over $100 billion of future sequestration \ncuts to DOD.  By gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and \nwomen fighting to keep America safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer \ndollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies.   \n \nIn addition, H.R. 5293 would impose other unneeded costs, constraining DOD's ability to \nbalance military capability, capacity, and readiness.  The Administration's defense strategy \ndepends on investing every dollar where it will have the greatest effect.  The Administration's \nFY 2017 proposals would accomplish this by continuing and expanding critical reforms that \ndivest unneeded force structure, balance growth in military compensation, modernize military \nhealth care, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The bill fails to adopt many of these reforms, \nincluding through measures prohibiting the use of funds to propose or plan for a new Base \nRealignment and Closure (BRAC) round.  The bill also continues unwarranted restrictions \nregarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay that threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's \nability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when \nand where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case \nand our national security interests. \n \nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the \nBBA, which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017.  By providing \nfully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for \ninvestments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term \ngrowth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration looks forward to working with the  Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support \neconomic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  However, the bill is \ninconsistent with the BBA, and the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of \nproblematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the \nPresident were presented with H.R. 5293, the President's senior advisors would recommend that \nhe veto the bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) \n \nReduction and Misuse of OCO Funds.  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's \nproposal to substitute $16 billion of DOD's OCO request in the FY 2017 Budget with $16 billion \nof unsustainable base budget programs that do not reflect the Department's highest joint \npriorities.  This approach creates a hollow force structure and risks the loss of funding for critical \noverseas contingency operations.  This gimmick is inconsistent with the BBA, which provided \nequal increases for defense and non-defense spending as well as the certainty needed to \nprosecute the counter-ISIL campaign, protect readiness recovery, modernize the force for future \nconflicts, and keep faith with servicemembers and their families.  Shortchanging wartime \noperations by $16 billion would deplete essential funding for ongoing operations by the middle \nof the year, introducing a dangerous level of uncertainty for our men and women in uniform \ncarrying out missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere.  Our troops need and deserve \nguaranteed, predictable support as they execute their missions year round, particularly in light of \nthe dangers they face in executing the Nation's ongoing overseas contingency operations. \n \nGuantanamo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 8097, 8098, \n8099, and 8130 of the bill, which would restrict the Executive Branch's ability to manage the \ndetainee population at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility.  Section 8098 would \nprohibit the use of funds for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house \nGuantanamo detainees in the United States.  Sections 8097 and 8099 would continue \nprohibitions and restrictions relating to transfers of detainees abroad.  In addition, section 8130 \nwould restrict the Department's ability to transfer U.S. Naval Station functions in support of \nnational security.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar \nprovisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions.  Operating \nthe detention facility at Guantanamo weakens our national security by draining resources, \ndamaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  \nThese provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to \ndetermine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and \nwhere to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and \nour national security interests.  Sections 8097 and 8099 would, moreover, violate constitutional \nseparation-of-powers principles in certain circumstances. \n \nMilitary End Strength.  The Administration strongly objects to the unnecessary funding for end \nstrength levels above the FY 2017 Budget request.  The bill would force the Department to take \nadditional risk in the training and readiness of the current force, as well as investment in and \nprocurement of future capabilities.  Adding unnecessary end strength in the manner proposed in \nthe bill would increase military personnel and operation and maintenance support costs by \napproximately $30 billion (FY 2017 through FY 2021).  This would also invite a significant, \n2  unacceptable risk of creating a future hollow force, in which force structure exists, but the \nresources to make it ready do not follow.  The Administration urges support of the Department's \nplan, which reflects sound strategy and responsible choices among capacity, capabilities, and \ncurrent and future readiness. \n \nMilitary Compensation Reform.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee has \nrejected the pay raise proposal and most of the health care reform proposals included in the \nFY 2017 Budget request.  The FY 2017 Budget request includes a set of commonsense reforms \nthat would allow the Department to achieve a proper balance between DOD's obligation to \nprovide competitive pay and benefits to servicemembers and its responsibility to provide troops \nthe finest training and equipment possible.  The Administration strongly encourages the \nCongress to support these reforms, which would save $500 million in FY 2017 and $11 billion \nthrough FY 2021. \n \nAvailability of Funds for Retirement or Inactivation of Ticonderoga-Class Cruisers or Dock \nLanding Ships.  The Administration strongly objects to section 8124 of the bill, which would \nprohibit the Navy from executing its phased modernization approach for maintaining an effective \ncruiser and dock landing ship force structure while balancing scarce operating and maintenance \nfunding.  It also would significantly reduce planned savings and accelerate the retirement of all \nTiconderoga-Class cruisers.  The Navy's current requirement for active large surface combatants \nincludes 11 Air Defense Commander ships, one assigned to each of the active carrier strike \ngroups.  This requirement is met by the modernization plan proposed in the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest.  Furthermore, section 8124 would require an additional $3.2 billion across the Future \nYears Defense Program (FYDP) to fund manpower, maintenance, modernization, and operations \nwhen compared to the FY 2017 Budget request. \n \nRestoration of Tenth Navy Carrier Air Wing.  The Administration strongly objects to restoration \nof the Carrier Air Wing in Title IX of the bill.  The tenth Carrier Air Wing is no longer needed, \nand results in ineffective use of the aircraft and pilot inventory in the Navy.  The plan proposed \nin the FY 2017 Budget request optimizes Carrier Air Wing force structure to meet the Global \nForce Management Allocation Plan demand in a sustainable way.  As an additional benefit, the \nplan also generates $926 million in FYDP savings.  Furthermore, if forced to retain the tenth \nCarrier Air Wing, the bill's current military personnel funding levels are insufficient.  The Navy \nwould require an additional $48 million in FY 2017 for military personnel above the levels \nalready in the bill, as well as an end strength increase of 1,167 above the Navy end strength in \nthe bill. \n \nRestoration of Third Littoral Combat Ship.  The Administration strongly objects to the \nCommittee's proposal to increase the purchase of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) in FY 2017 from \ntwo to three.  The FY 2017 Budget request reduced from 52 to 40 the total number of LCS and \nFrigates (FF) the Navy would purchase over the life of the program.  A combined program of 40 \nLCS and FF would allow DOD to invest in advanced capabilities across the fleet and would \nprovide sufficient capacity to meet the Department's warfighting needs and to exceed recent \npresence levels with a more modern and capable ship than legacy mine sweepers, frigates, and \ncoastal patrol craft they would replace.  By funding two LCS in FY 2017, the Budget request \nensures that both shipyards are on equal footing and have robust production leading up to the \ncompetition to select the shipyard that would continue the program.  This competitive \nenvironment ensures the best price for the taxpayer on the remaining ships, while also achieving \nsavings by down-selecting to one shipyard.  The bill prevents the use of resources for higher \n3  priorities to improve DOD's warfighting capability, such as undersea, other surface, and aviation \ninvestments. \n \nProhibition on Proposing, Planning, or Conducting an Additional Base Realignment and \nClosure (BRAC) Round.  The Administration strongly objects to section 8121 of the bill and the \nproposed $3.5 million reduction to funds that would support a 2019 BRAC round.  By forcing \nthe Department to spread its resources more thinly, excess infrastructure is one of the principal \ndrains on the Department's readiness, which the Committee recognizes as a major concern.  In \naddition to addressing every previous congressional objection to BRAC authorization, the \nDepartment recently conducted a DOD-wide parametric capacity analysis, which demonstrates \nthat the Department has 22 percent excess capacity.  In addition, the Administration's BRAC \nlegislative proposal includes several changes that respond to congressional concerns regarding \ncost.  Specifically, the revised BRAC legislation requires the Secretary to certify that BRAC \nwould have the primary objective of eliminating excess capacity and reducing costs, emphasizes \nrecommendations that yield net savings within five years (subject to military value), and limits \nrecommendations that take longer than 20 years to pay back.  The Administration strongly urges \nthe Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can make better use of \nscarce resources to maintain readiness. \n \nAsia-Pacific Rebalance Infrastructure.  The Administration strongly objects to the exclusion of a \ngeneral provision requested in the FY 2017 Budget that would allow for $86.7 million of the \namounts appropriated for the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide account to be available \nfor the Secretary of Defense to make grants, conclude cooperative agreements, and supplement \nother Federal funds.  This critical provision addresses the need to provide assistance for civilian \nwater and wastewater improvements to support the military build-up on Guam, as well as critical \nexisting and enduring military installations and missions on Guam.  A key aspect of the Asia-\nPacific rebalance is to create a more operationally resilient Marine Corps presence in the Pacific \nand invest in Guam as a joint strategic hub.  This funding supports the ability and flexibility of \nthe President to execute our foreign and defense policies in coordination with our ally, Japan.  In \naddition, it calls into question among regional states our commitment to implement the \nrealignment plan and our ability to execute our defense strategy. \n \nProhibition of Funds to Enforce Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n2007.  The Administration strongly objects to section 8132 of the bill, which would prohibit \nDOD from using FY 2017 funds to enforce section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security \nAct of 2007.  Section 526 provides an environmentally sound framework for the development of \nfuture alternative fuels. \n \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle.  The Administration objects to the reductions to both the \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle and the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Infrastructure \nrequested in the FY 2017 Budget.  The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle reduction would \neliminate three launch service procurements, instead of the two procurements the Committee \nintended.  Further, the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Infrastructure reduction exceeds the \namount ascribed to these two procurements, and would cause the Government to default on the \ncurrent contract and the block buy, unnecessarily introducing costs and schedule risk for national \nsecurity space payloads. \n \nMissile Defense Programs.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $324 million from the \nFY 2017 Budget request for U.S. ballistic missile defense programs, including $49 million to \n4  homeland defense programs, $91 million to U.S. regional missile defense programs, $44 million \nto missile defense testing efforts, and $140 million to missile defense advanced technology \nprograms.  These programs are required to improve the reliability of missile defense system and \nensure the United States stays ahead of the future ballistic missile threat.  Furthermore, the \nAdministration opposes the addition of $455 million above the FY 2017 Budget request for \nIsraeli missile defense procurement and cooperative development programs.  \n \nCoalition Support Fund (CSF).  The Administration objects to section 9020 of the bill, which \nwould rescind funds available for CSF by $300 million.  Reducing CSF would limit DOD's \nability to reimburse key allies in the fight against ISIL and other extremist groups in the region.  \nThe rescission is especially harmful because it would reduce funds available for programs that \nare already underway and would limit DOD's flexibility to continue to program these funds for \ncritical needs.  The Administration urges the Congress to retain the authority to make certain \nfunds available to support stability activities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas as \nprovided in section 1212(f) of the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act. \n \nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF).  The Administration objects to the reduction of \n$250 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for CTPF because it would restrict the resources \nrequired to empower and enable partners in responding to shared terrorist threats around the \nworld.  The Administration also objects to the $200 million rescission in FY 2016 CTPF \nresources in the bill.  Both of these reductions would preclude DOD from continuing important \nsecurity assistance programs begun in FY 2016.  The Administration strongly encourages the \nCongress to provide the $1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities in \nFY 2017 and restore the rescinded FY 2016 funding. \n \nElimination of Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF) Funding.  The Administration \nobjects to the elimination of the $99 million JUONF base funding requested in the FY 2017 \nBudget.  This funding is vital to the Department's ability to quickly respond to urgent operational \nneeds.  Eliminating this funding may increase life-threatening risks to servicemembers and \ncontribute to critical mission failures. \n \nRapid Prototyping, Experimentation and Demonstration.  The Administration objects to the \nreduction of $42 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for the Navy's research and \ndevelopment funding to support the Rapid Prototyping, Experimentation and Demonstration \n(RPED) initiative.  RPED is an essential element in the Navy's strategy to employ successful \ninnovation technologies to help pace the dynamic threat of our adversaries, more quickly address \nurgent capability needs, accelerate our speed of innovation, and rapidly develop and deliver \nadvanced warfighting capability to naval forces.  This reduction would render the initiative \nineffective in promoting rapid acquisition, hindering the Navy's ability to determine the technical \nfeasibility and operational utility of advanced technologies before committing billions of dollars \ntoward development.  This reduction hinders the Department-wide goal of employing new \ntechniques to make the acquisition process more agile and efficient. \n \nInnovation and Access to Non-Traditional Suppliers.  The Administration objects to the \nreduction of $30 million for programs that seek to broaden DOD's access to innovative \ncompanies and technologies.  Specifically, the Administration is concerned about the elimination \nof the investment funding associated with the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx), as \nwell as the reduction in funding for In-Q-Tel's efforts to explore innovative technologies that \nenable the efficient incorporation into weapons systems and operations capabilities.  These \n5  investments would enable the development of leading-edge, primarily asymmetric capabilities \nand help spur development of new ways of warfighting to counter advanced adversaries. \n \nReduction of Funds for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Situational \nAwareness System.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $27 million from the FY 2017 \nBudget request for the development of a CWMD situational awareness information system, \nknown as \"Constellation.\"  The Department is developing and fielding this system in response to \nrequirements articulated by all Combatant Commands and validated by the Joint Requirements \nOversight Council.  This capability is critical to anticipating WMD threats from both nation-state \nand non-state actors and sharing information between DOD and its U.S. interagency and \ninternational partners.  Funds were appropriated in FY 2014-2016 specifically to develop and \nfield the Constellation system, which would be deployed in July 2016 as an initial prototype.  A \nreduction of $27 million would effectively terminate this initiative and prevent DOD from \ndeveloping a high priority capability needed to counter WMD threats. \n \nNavy High Energy Lasers.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $20 million from the \nFY 2017 Budget request for the Power Projection Advanced Technology program, which would \ndelay by one year fielding of the High Energy Laser (HEL) program laser and demonstration of \nits technology maturation.  The HEL technology is a means of countering low-cost unmanned \naerial vehicles and small surface vessels. \n \nLimitation on Intelligence Community General Transfer Authority (GTA).  The Administration \nobjects to section 8096 of the bill, which reduces the Intelligence Community's (IC's) FY 2016 \nenacted GTA cap from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion for FY 2017.  This proposed cap would place \nsevere limits on the IC's flexibility to manage resources and could compromise the ability to \nmeet critical intelligence priorities at a time of shifting and dynamic worldwide threats, \nespecially in urgent circumstances.  This flexibility is especially important given the broad \napplicability of the GTA constraints to the appropriation accounts that fund IC. \n \nAvailability of Funds for Improvement of IC Financial Management.  The Administration objects \nto section 8066 of the bill, which places limits on the ability of IC to review and take action on \nfinancial management improvement measures.  The Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence and DOD are engaged in a comprehensive review of financial management practices \nthat may result in recommendations for changes to financial management or appropriations \nstructures. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSeveral other provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 8055, \n8071, 8121, and provisions under the headings \"Operations and Maintenance\u2014Defense-wide\" \nand \"Joint Improvised Threat Defeat Fund\" may interfere with the President's authority as \nCommander in Chief. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n6  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nNovember 30, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 8 - North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015 \n(Rep.

The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 8 because it would undermine already \nsuccessful initiatives designed to modernize the Nation's energy infrastructure and increase our \nenergy efficiency.  \n \nIncreased energy efficiency offers savings on energy bills, provides opportunities for more jobs, \nand improves industrial competitiveness.  H.R. 8 would stifle the Nation's move toward energy \nefficiency by severely hampering the Department of Energy's (DOE) ability to provide technical \nsupport for building code development and State implementation.  In addition, the bill would \nundercut DOE's ability to enforce its appliance standards and would weaken section 433 of the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which requires a reduction in fossil fuel-\ngenerated energy in Federal buildings. \n \nH.R. 8 includes a provision regarding certain operational characteristics in capacity markets \noperated by Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators \n(ISOs).  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and RTOs and ISOs are already \nwell positioned, especially as technologies change over time, to ensure that capacity market \nstructures adequately provide for the procurement of sufficient capacity to efficiently and \nreliably fulfill the resource-adequacy function that these markets are intended to perform. \n \nH.R. 8 includes new, unnecessary provisions that would broaden FERC's authority to impose \ndeadlines on other Federal agencies reviewing the environmental implications of natural gas \npipeline applications.  H.R. 8 also would unnecessarily curtail DOE's ability to fully consider \nwhether natural gas export projects are consistent with the public interest.   \n \nFurther, H.R. 8 would undermine the current hydropower licensing regulatory process in place \nunder the Federal Power Act that works to minimize negative impacts associated with the siting \nof hydropower projects, including negative impacts on safety, fish and wildlife, water quality and \nconservation, and a range of additional natural resources and cultural values.  Among the ways \nthat H.R. 8 would undermine this process would be by creating a new exemption from licensing \nthat would undercut bedrock environmental statutes, including the Clean Water Act, the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, and the Endangered Species Act.  \n \nFinally, H.R. 8 presents certain constitutional concerns.  Sections 1104 and 3004 would \nimpermissibly interfere with the President's authorities with regard to the conduct of diplomacy \nand in some cases diplomatic communications, and sections 1109 and 1201 raise concerns under  the Recommendations Clause. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R 8, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  September 21, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5931 \u2013 Prohibiting Future Ransom Payments to Iran Act \n(Rep. Royce, R-CA, and 70 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5931, which is an ill-advised attempt to respond to a \nproblem \u2013 so-called \"ransom\" payments to Iran \u2013 that does not exist, in a way that would \nundermine U.S. obligations and ultimately benefit Iran at the expense of the United States.  The \nbill purports to raise concerns about the announcement in January that the United States brought \nhome several unjustly detained Americans from Iran.  As the Administration has repeatedly \nmade clear, Iran released several detained Americans, and the United States provided relief to \ncertain Iranian citizens charged with primarily sanctions-related offenses, several of whom are \ndual U.S.-Iranian nationals, in a one-time, reciprocal humanitarian gesture that brought our \nAmericans home after 14 months of intensive negotiations.  As the President has affirmed, the \nUnited States did not pay ransom to secure the return of our Americans from Iran.  As was also \nannounced publicly in January, the United States transferred funds to Iran to effectuate the \nsettlement of a long-standing claim at the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal at The Hague (the \nTribunal).  The settlement of this 35-year old claim was resolved to the benefit of the U.S. \ntaxpayer.  The timing of the settlement was a consequence of the United States taking advantage \nof the opening of diplomatic opportunities with Iran on several fronts simultaneously, including \nImplementation Day of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the intensification \nof negotiations to release unjustly detained Americans.  Both of these diplomatic achievements \nand the settlement of the Tribunal claim were made possible by this intensified engagement \u2013 all \nthree were resolved on their own merits and were profoundly in the U.S. interest. \n \nThis bill, while styled as prohibiting future purported \"ransom payments,\" instead bars virtually \nany payment from the U.S. Government to Iran, including those permitted or even required by \nlaw.  Specifically, this bill would effectively prevent the United States from paying out awards \nrendered by the Tribunal and, thus, risk putting the United States in violation of our obligations \nunder the Algiers Accords \u2013 an agreement concluded by President Carter, endorsed by President \nReagan and honored by every President since that time.  Since the establishment of the Tribunal \nin 1981, the Tribunal has resolved numerous substantial claims of U.S. nationals against Iran, \nwith over $2.5 billion being paid out to the U.S. claimants. \n \nFurther, this bill could effectively remove the President's ability to settle Tribunal claims with \nIran for the foreseeable and indefinite future by requiring unrealistic certifications and \nnotifications.  This is an unprecedented restriction on the President's claims settlement authority \nthat would adversely affect our ability to resolve Tribunal claims on favorable terms to the U.S. \ntaxpayer, as we did in January.  It would be unprecedented for the Congress to impose rigid, ex \nante conditions on the President's prerogative to settle claims with foreign sovereigns. \n \nThis bill would benefit Iran, not the United States.  Settlements of Tribunal claims, over several \ndecades, have already saved the U.S. taxpayers potentially billions of dollars.  Removing the  President's authority to settle these claims virtually guarantees higher monetary awards for Iran \nafter years of continued litigation \u2013 and the U.S. taxpayers will be stuck with the bill.  \n \nThe bottom line is that this bill is a short-sighted response to politicized discussions about the \nrecent Tribunal settlement.  It undermines our international obligations in an unprecedented \nfashion that, ultimately, advantages Iran at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer.    \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5931, he would veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nJanuary 27, 2016 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 2012 \u2013 Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015  \n(Sen. Murkowski, R-AK)  \n \nThe Administration appreciates the bipartisan support for addressing key energy and \nconservation priorities in S. 2012.  Modernizing the Nation's energy system and the policies that \ngovern it has been a central focus of the Administration's efforts to combat climate change, \nstrengthen energy security and resilience, and enhance our economic competitiveness.  Through \ninvestments in research, development, and deployment; fuel economy standards; the President's \nClimate Action Plan; the Clean Power Plan; the Quadrennial Energy Review; and other \ninitiatives, the Administration has made considerable progress in advancing cleaner energy \nsystems that continue to deliver reliable and affordable energy for American homes and \nbusinesses.  \n \nS. 2012 would focus on energy efficiency, energy infrastructure, energy supply, and \nconservation.  The Administration believes that these are important issues and supports some \nprovisions of the legislation.  In particular, the bill would benefit conservation by permanently \nreauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Historic Preservation Fund, and by \ncreating a new Park Maintenance and Revitalization Fund to help address the maintenance \nbacklog at our National Parks.  In addition, the bill would address several key energy priorities.  \nIt would reauthorize the weatherization assistance and State energy programs, support \ngeothermal energy development, and advance energy job training, all of which support the \nPresident's Climate Action Plan.  \n \nHowever, the Administration has concerns with other parts of the legislation including \nprovisions that would: generate budgetary scoring issues associated with energy savings \ncontracts, which represent an important tool in advancing Federal sustainability; repeal existing \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) programs that aim to improve efficiency at manufacturing \nfacilities; eliminate DOE oversight of certain technology demonstration and commercial activity \nat National Laboratories; eliminate independent certification requirements for certain ENERGY \nSTAR products; potentially delay issuance of final rules by unnecessarily requiring Federal \nagencies to respond to reliability analyses already required under Executive Order 13211; omit \nkey security considerations with regard to provisions dealing with cybersecurity and computing; \ncreate permitting processes and governance structures for certain energy infrastructure projects \nthat are redundant or inconsistent with recently enacted law; and limit project reviews under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act.  The Administration appreciates the role that carbon-free \nhydropower plays in meeting the Nation's energy needs.  S. 2012 would improve upon the \nhydropower relicensing provision contained in H.R. 8, but the Administration has concerns about \nits implementability. \n \n \n  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns as the bill moves through the legislative process.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nApril 18, 2016 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1206 \u2013 No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act \n (Rep.

These bills would impose unnecessary constraints on the Internal \nRevenue Service's (IRS) operations without improving the agency's ability to administer the tax \ncode and serve taxpayers. \n \nH.R. 1206 would prohibit the IRS from hiring any new employees until the Secretary of the \nTreasury certifies that no IRS employee has a seriously delinquent debt, or provides a report to \nthe Congress that includes an explanation of why certification is not possible and what would be \nrequired to provide such a certification. The bill could result in the IRS being prohibited from \nhiring any new employees for any purpose \u2013 a drastic and counterproductive step that would \ncompromise tax administration and taxpayer services.  The bill is also unworkable in operation, \nas \"seriously delinquent\" debts could be as low as $1 and tax liens are recorded on a case-by-case \nbasis.  This legislation is unnecessary, as strong laws and procedures already exist to ensure that \nIRS employees comply with their tax obligations.  Publicly-available data show that IRS \nemployees are among the most tax compliant groups in the Nation with a delinquency rate of less \nthan 1 percent.   \n \nH.R. 4890 would ban performance awards to IRS employees until the Secretary of the Treasury \ndevelops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy.  This bill is unnecessary, \nas the IRS has already developed and has begun to execute a strategy to improve taxpayer \nservices.  The real constraint on the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers effectively is severe \nunderfunding, including for taxpayer services.  IRS funding is more than $900 million below its \n2010 level, before adjusting for inflation.  These budget cuts have impeded the IRS's ability to \nserve taxpayers, including inadequate responses to taxpayer calls and correspondence.  Filing \nseason statistics show that taxpayer service has improved this year as a result of a small funding \nincrease provided last year, but more resources are needed to serve all taxpayers effectively and \nefficiently.  Legislation constraining the IRS's ability to retain and recruit highly qualified \nemployees is not needed and could be counterproductive to the Service's mission. \n \nH.R. 3724 would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily separated \ndue to misconduct.  The bill as written could force the immediate termination of employees who \nhad been terminated and rehired many years ago, even if their performance since rehiring has \nbeen blemish-free.  The bill's prohibition is also unnecessary because current IRS processes  already ensure the agency does not rehire former employees who had significant conduct or \nperformance problems during prior employment with the agency.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nMay 16, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nH.R. 4909 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 \n(Rep. Thornberry, R-TX, and Rep. Smith, D-WA) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee's continued support of our \nnational defense and supports a number of provisions in H.R. 4909, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017.  However, the Administration strongly \nobjects to many provisions in this bill that impede the Administration's ability to carry out the \nPresident's defense strategy. \n \nH.R. 4909 fails to provide our troops with the resources they need to keep our Nation safe.  \nInstead of fully funding wartime operations such as INHERENT RESOLVE to defeat ISIL, the \nbill would redirect $18 billion of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds toward base \nbudget programs that the Department of Defense (DOD) did not request, cutting off critical \nfunding for wartime operations after April 30, 2017.  Not only is this approach dangerous, but it \nis also wasteful.  The bill would buy excess force structure without the money to sustain it, \neffectively creating hollow force structure that would undermine DOD's efforts to restore \nreadiness.  Furthermore, the bill's funding approach attempts to unravel the dollar-for-dollar \nbalance of defense and non-defense funding increases provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act \n(BBA) of 2015, threatening future steps needed to reverse over $100 billion of future \nsequestration cuts to DOD.  By gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our \nmen and women fighting to keep America safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of \ntaxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our \nenemies. \n \nIn addition, H.R. 4909 would impose other unneeded costs, constraining DOD's ability to \nbalance military capability, capacity, and readiness.  The President's defense strategy depends on \ninvesting every dollar where it will have the greatest effect.  The Administration's FY 2017 \nproposals will accomplish this by continuing and expanding critical reforms that divest unneeded \nforce structure, balance growth in compensation, modernize military health care, and reduce \nwasteful overhead.  The bill fails to adopt many of these reforms, including failing to authorize a \nnew Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.   \n \nThe bill also continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay, would \nprevent the United States from fulfilling its obligations under a treaty, and includes non-germane \npolicy riders, such as those undermining the Endangered Species Act as well as public land \nmanagement statutes, and those that would make it easier to discriminate on the basis of sexual \norientation, which have nothing to do with national defense.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4909, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill.  \n  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below, and urges the Congress to work \nin a bipartisan fashion to make necessary changes to the bill.  The Administration also looks \nforward to reviewing the bill's classified annex and working with the Committee to address any \nconcerns on classified programs. \n  \nReduction, Expiration, and Misuse of OCO Funds:  The Administration strongly objects to the \nbill's proposal to substitute $18 billion of the Department's OCO request with $18 billion of \nunsustainable base budget programs that do not reflect the Department's highest joint priorities.  \nThis approach creates a hollow force structure and risks the loss of funding for critical overseas \ncontingency operations.  This gimmick is inconsistent with the BBA, which provided equal \nincreases for defense and non-defense spending as well as the certainty needed to prosecute the \ncounter-ISIL campaign, protect readiness recovery, modernize the force for future conflicts, and \nkeep faith with service members and their families.   \n \nProvisions in the bill that would cause OCO funds in military personnel, operation and \nmaintenance, defense health program, and working capital funds accounts to expire on April 30, \n2017 are unacceptable.  Shortchanging wartime operations by $18 billion and cutting off funding \nin the middle of the year introduces a dangerous level of uncertainty for our men and women in \nuniform carrying out missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere.  Our troops need and \ndeserve guaranteed, predictable support as they execute their missions year round, particularly in \nlight of the dangers they face in executing the country's ongoing overseas contingency \noperations. \n \nCounter Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Efforts:  The Administration strongly objects \nto the bill's proposal to cut OCO funding for U.S. efforts to counter ISIL and to prevent the \navailability of critical counter-ISIL funds after April 2017.  Reducing funding for train and equip \nactivities in Iraq and Syria and cutting off funding mid-year would inhibit the U.S. military's \nability to work with the Government of Iraq (GoI), the Syrian opposition, and other local forces \nto combat ISIL; interrupt ongoing U.S. support for forces on the ground in the middle of the \nyear; and call into question the reliability of the U.S. commitment to support its partners.  \n \nThe Administration also strongly objects to provisions in sections 1221 and 1222, which would \nfurther hamper the United States' ability to counter ISIL.  A unified Iraq led by a multisectarian \ngovernment is a U.S. national security interest, but the bill's approach for supporting the Kurdish \nforces contradicts stated U.S. policy of countering ISIL \"by, with, and through\" the GoI.  Current \npolicy has not inhibited U.S. support to Kurdish or Sunni forces, who with the Iraqi Army have \nreclaimed territory from ISIL control.  In addition, the requirement that not more than 75 percent \nof the authorized funds under section 1222 may be obligated or expended until after the \nSecretaries of Defense and State submit a plan to the Congressional Committees to retake and \nhold Mosul limits the U.S. ability to respond to evolving needs of Iraqi forces as necessary to \nsuccessfully support their campaign against ISIL.  Finally, the expansion of a Secretary of \nDefense reprogramming certification requirement in section 1221 would add unnecessary \nbureaucracy, hamper the Department's ability to support the warfighter in a timely and flexible \nmanner, and risk jeopardizing acceleration and effectiveness of the counter-ISIL campaign in \nSyria. \n \nGuantanamo Detainee Provisions:  The Administration strongly objects to several provisions of \nthe bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  As the Administration has \n2  said many times before, operating this facility weakens our national security by draining \nresources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent \nextremists.  In February, the Administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely and \nresponsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter of \nour history to a close.  Rather than taking steps to close the facility, this bill aims to extend its \noperation.  Sections 1032 and 1033 would continue to prohibit the use of funds to transfer \nGuantanamo detainees to the United States or even to construct or modify any facility in the \nUnited States to house detainees.  These restrictions would limit the ability of the Executive \nBranch to take the steps necessary to develop alternative locations for a detention facility, and \nfrom fulfilling its commitment to close the facility at Guantanamo.  The bill would also leave in \nplace onerous restrictions on the transfer of detainees to foreign countries, and section 1034 \nwould, in some cases, seek to prohibit certain transfers entirely.  The President has objected to \nthe inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation.  These restrictions are \nunwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the \nappropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute \nthem, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests, and \nwhen and where to transfer them consistent with our national security and our humane treatment \npolicy.  Sections 1032 and 1034 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation of powers \nprinciples, and section 1034 could in some circumstances interfere with the ability to transfer a \ndetainee who has been granted a writ of habeas corpus. \n \nMilitary End Strength:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 401 and 411, which \nwould establish end strength levels above the President's Budget request for Active and Reserve \nForces as of September 30, 2017.  These provisions would force the Department to take \nadditional risk in training and readiness of the current force, as well as investment in and \nprocurement of future capabilities.  In addition, the Administration objects to section 402, which \nwould establish a new minimum active-duty end strength for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air \nForce as of September 30, 2017.  Adding unnecessary end strength in the manner proposed in the \nbill would invite a significant, unacceptable risk of creating a future hollow force, in which force \nstructure exists, but the resources to make it ready do not follow.  The Administration urges \nsupport of the Department's plan, which reflects sound strategy and responsible choices among \ncapacity, capabilities, and current and future readiness.  \n \nTRICARE Reform:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the transition to \ntwo TRICARE programs, TRICARE Prime and Preferred.  However, sections 701 and 704 \nwould eliminate almost all of the savings ($200 million in FY 2017 and $7 billion through FY \n2021) contained in the Administration's proposal and instead add almost $1 billion in costs to the \nDefense Health Program.  It also creates a complex system of separate benefits for members and \nretirees based on their dates of initial entry into military service.  Further, the proposed pharmacy \nco-pay adjustments and reasonable enrollment fee for TRICARE for Life participants were \nrejected.  The Administration believes strongly that the President's FY 2017 Military Health \nSystem (MHS) benefit reform package represents a reasonable and financially sound proposal \nfor our beneficiaries.  We look forward to working with the Congress on needed TRICARE \nreforms as part of a comprehensive package of MHS reforms. \n \nModifications to the Newly-Created Military Retirement System:  The Administration \nappreciates the flexibility provided by section 622 and urges the Congress to support the use of \ncontinuation pay for service members with up to 16 years of service, given varying retention \nrates across career fields and the military departments.  However, the Administration is \n3  concerned about mandating a 2.5 monthly basic pay multiplier for continuation pay for all \nmembers.  Allowing DOD greater flexibility to adjust the timing and amount of continuation pay \nwould allow military services to shape the force more effectively and efficiently.  \n \nMilitary Pay Raise:  The Administration objects to section 601.  This section places restrictions \non the President's authority to set an alternative pay adjustment for members of the uniformed \nservices at 1.6 percent basic pay, which would save $336 million in FY 2017 and $2.2 billion \nthrough FY 2021.  The President's FY 2017 pay proposal would allow the Department to achieve \na proper balance between DOD's obligation to provide competitive pay to service members and \nits responsibility to provide troops the finest training and equipment possible. \n \nProhibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Round:   The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges the Congress to provide \nBRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can make better use of scarce resources.  In \naddition to addressing every previous Congressional objection to BRAC authorization, the \nDepartment recently conducted a DOD-wide parametric capacity analysis which demonstrates \nthat the Department has 22 percent excess capacity.  Additionally, the Administration's BRAC \nlegislative proposal includes several changes that respond to Congressional concerns regarding \ncost.  Specifically, the revised BRAC legislation requires the Secretary to certify that BRAC will \nhave the primary objective of eliminating excess capacity and reducing costs; emphasizes \nrecommendations that yield net savings within five years (subject to military value); and limits \nrecommendations that take longer than 20 years to pay back.    \n \nRocket Propulsion System Development Program:  The Administration appreciates the amended \nlanguage to section 1608 of the FY 2015 NDAA to authorize up to 18 RD-180 engines, ensuring \na necessary and cost-effective bridge to American-made launch services.  However, the \nAdministration strongly objects to section 1601, which would place restrictions on the funds to \neliminate the Nation's use of these engines for national security space launches.  The \nCommittee's approach overemphasizes one component of a launch vehicle and, in doing so, risks \nthe successful and timely fielding of new domestic launch systems.  The Administration is \ncommitted to developing new American-made propulsion systems as part of these new launch \nvehicles, but this should be done in accordance with well-accepted systems engineering \nprinciples and not arbitrary funding allocations.   \n \nThe Administration also strongly objects to the direction in section 1601 requiring the \nacquisition of Government purpose rights and technical data for any new rocket propulsion \nsystem.  Complying with this direction is not feasible as it would likely require re-negotiation of \nthe current development contracts, thereby delaying the delivery of the new domestic capabilities \nbeyond 2019.  Pursuing such robust data rights would also undermine the very nature of the \npublic-private partnerships, require significantly more Government funding, and risk further \nindustry investment and participation.  The Administration's public-private partnerships are \nsuccessfully leveraging willing private investment to develop commercially viable launch \nvehicles, and this has already saved taxpayers nearly $200 million, while maintaining access to \nthe data that the Government needs.  These partnerships could save taxpayers more than $500 \nmillion through 2019 and deliver valuable capabilities for the Nation and benefits to our \neconomy faster than the Committee's approach.  \n \nAvailability of Funds for Retirement or Inactivation of Ticonderoga-Class Cruisers or Dock \nLanding Ships:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1024, which would prohibit \n4  obligating or expending FY 2017 funds to retire, prepare to retire, inactivate, or place in storage \nmore than six cruisers and one dock landing ship.  This provision would prevent the Navy from \nexecuting its phased modernization approach for maintaining an effective cruiser and dock \nlanding ship force structure while balancing scarce operations and maintenance funding.  It also \nwould significantly reduce planned savings, accelerate the retirement of all Ticonderoga-Class \ncruisers, and create obsolescence of Air Defense Commander platforms resulting in a significant \nsurface combatant shortfall in 2030.  When compared to the cruiser phased modernization plan \nproposed in the FY 2017 President's Budget, the proposed language of this section would require \nan additional $3.2 billion across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) to fund manpower, \nmaintenance, modernization, and operations.   \n \nIn addition, the prohibition on obligating more than 75 percent of funds made available for the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) until the Secretary of the Navy enters into ship \nmodernization contracts would require significant reductions in manpower over and above the 25 \npercent reduction planned in the FY 2017 President's Budget for OSD, as well as curtailed \nspending for joint force readiness programs such as the Commanders Exercise and Engagement \nTraining Transformation and the Readiness and Environment Protection Integration Program. \n \nLittoral Combat Ships (LCS): The Administration strongly objects to the bill's proposal to \nincrease the purchase of LCS in FY 2017 from two to three as noted in the table supporting \nSection 4013, Shipbuilding and Conversion line number 11.  The Administration reduced from \n52 to 40 the total number of LCS and Frigates (FF) the Navy will purchase over the life of the \nprogram. A combined 40 LCS and FF will allow for the Department to invest in advanced \ncapabilities across the fleet and will provide sufficient capacity to meet the Department's \nwarfighting needs and to exceed recent presence levels with a more modern and capable ship \nthan legacy mine sweepers, frigates, and coastal patrol craft they will replace.  By funding two \nLCS in FY 2017, the President's Budget ensures that both shipyards are on equal footing and \nhave robust production leading up to the competition to select the shipyard that will continue the \nprogram.  Both LCS yards will remain active for five or more years.  This competitive \nenvironment ensures the best price for the taxpayer on the remaining ships, while also achieving \nsavings by down-selecting to one shipyard.  The bill prevents the use of resources for higher \npriorities to improve the Department's warfighting capability, like undersea, other surface, and \naviation investments. \n \nCoalition Support Fund (CSF):  The Administration objects to section 1212, which would make \n$450 million of CSF to Pakistan ineligible for the Secretary of Defense's waiver authority unless \nthe Secretary provides a certification to the Congressional defense committees.  We share the \nCommittee's concerns regarding the threat posed to our forces and interests in Afghanistan by the \nHaqqani Network, and we continue to engage with Pakistan at the highest levels regarding the \nneed for concerted action specifically against the group.  However, the restriction in section 1212 \nwould unnecessarily complicate progress in our bilateral relationship on this issue and would \nlimit the Secretary of Defense's ability to act in the U.S. national security interest.  The \nAdministration is also disappointed that the committee did not modify CSF authority to allow \nDOD to reimburse coalition nations that support U.S. efforts in Afghanistan and to counter the \nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant, as requested.  This limitation could hamper the United \nStates' ability to counter terrorists and to support our allies in the region, including partners who \nhave the capability to perform the Counter-ISIL mission, but who lack the funds to pay for a \ndeployment and sustainment of operations in Iraq or Syria.  Lastly, the Department asks the \n5  Congress to retain the authority to make certain funds available to support stability activities in \nthe Federally Administered Tribal Areas as provided in section 1212(f) of the FY 2016 NDAA.   \n \nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF):  The Administration objects to the reduction of \n$250 million of CTPF in section 1510 because it would limit a valuable partnership-focused \napproach to counterterrorism.  Reducing CTPF precludes DOD from continuing important \nsecurity assistance programs begun in FY 2016. The Administration strongly encourages the \nCongress to authorize the $1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities \nin FY 2017.  \n \nReduction in the Number of Navy Carrier Air Wings:  The Administration objects to Carrier Air \nWing Restoration in section 4303.  The elimination of the tenth Carrier Air Wing proposed in the \nFY 2017 President's Budget optimizes Carrier Air Wing force structure to meet Global Force \nManagement Allocation Plan demand, sustains the health and wholeness of Naval Aviation, and \ngenerates $926 million in FYDP savings.  Additionally, if forced to retain the tenth Carrier Air \nWing, the Navy would require an additional $48 million in FY 2017 for military personnel and \nan additional increase of 1,167 in end strength above the objectionable end strength increase \nalready in the bill.   \n \nJoint Intelligence Analysis Complex (JIAC):  The Administration strongly objects to the bill's \nomission from section 2301(b) of authorization for expending funds associated with the $53.1 \nmillion needed for  phase three (of three) of construction of the JIAC at Royal Air Force (RAF) \nCroughton, United Kingdom.  This important project recapitalizes critically deficient facilities by \nconsolidating and relocating RAF Molesworth operations and missions in support of United \nStates European Command (USEUCOM), United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM), and \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  The Administration also strongly objects to \nsection 1623, which would restrict the Department's hiring of critically-needed intelligence \nprofessionals specializing in Russia at a time when the Russian threat to the United States and \nour European allies is increasing and requires redoubled intelligence collaboration.  In March \n2016, pursuant to requirements in the FY 2016 NDAA, the FY 2016 Intelligence Authorization \nAct, and the FY 2016 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, the Department certified that \nRAF Croughton remains the optimal location for recapitalization of the JIAC, that Lajes Air \nField in Portugal is not an optimal location for the JIAC, and there are no alternative uses for \nLajes Air Field.  Delays in the JIAC project jeopardize $74 million in annual savings that will be \nachieved once RAF Molesworth and RAF Alconbury, which currently host and support the \nUSEUCOM/USAFRICOM/NATO intelligence mission, are able to close as scheduled.   \n \nAlternative Fuels:  The Administration strongly objects to section 311, which would dilute the \npublic policy established by section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \n(contracting requirements for alternative or synthetic fuel) -- a law passed with strong bipartisan \nsupport that provides a sound framework for the development of future alternative fuels.  A \ndiverse approach to energy security, one that includes both conventional and new sources, will \nbenefit the economy and enhance our military capability. \n \nLimitation on Availability of Funds for Acceleration of Nuclear Weapons Dismantlement:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 3118 which puts unnecessary restrictions on the ability \nof the President to exercise his responsibilities to manage the nuclear arsenal.  The \nAdministration also strongly objects to the reduction in funding for accelerated dismantlement of \nretired nuclear warheads.  The United States has a considerable backlog of retired warheads \n6  awaiting dismantlement that are no longer needed for military purposes.  Funding for accelerated \ndismantlement is important both to appropriately manage the U.S. nuclear arsenal in a safe and \neffective way and to demonstrate continued U.S. commitment to our nonproliferation and \ndisarmament commitments. \n \nUndermining Federal Oversight:  The bill would hinder the effective oversight of critical nuclear \nsecurity, safety, and environmental management programs, including: weapons modernization, \nnuclear nonproliferation, physical and cyber security, as well as cleanup and project management \nactivities.  Section 3116 and section 3117 would limit expenditures for salaries and program \ndirection until the Secretary of Energy submits specific plans to Congress. These restrictions, \ncoupled with authorized funding levels $40 million below the President's request for National \nNuclear Security Administration (NNSA) staffing, threaten the ability of the Department of \nEnergy to recruit, maintain and train Federal staff to oversee the management of the nuclear \nsecurity enterprise and the legacy of waste and contamination from nuclear weapons \nproduction.  Relative to 2011, NNSA's workforce is 17 percent smaller despite an 18 percent \nincrease in program funding.  One measure of this imbalance of staffing-to-workload relates to \nthe acquisition workforce.  For NNSA, each Federal acquisition professional manages an average \nof $116 million of program dollars compared to the Government average of $10.7 million. \n \nThe Administration is concerned about section 3117, which would hold back 10 percent of \nprogram direction funds within the defense environmental cleanup program as a penalty until the \nsubmission of a report that presupposes the President's Budget request for future years. This \nprovision infringes upon the Department's ability to manage its Federal workforce by arbitrarily \nlimiting the expending of program direction funds that are used to pay salaries of workers who \nprovide critically important Federal oversight at environmental cleanup sites across the country. \n \nProhibition on Availability of Funds for Provision of Certain Assistance to Russian \nFederation:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3115, which would prohibit the use \nof funds for nuclear security activities in Russia unless the activities are \"new and emergency\" in \nnature, and unless the Department certifies that it has no backlog of deferred maintenance to \nphysical security equipment and its own defense nuclear facilities.  Effectively a blanket \nprohibition on nuclear security cooperation with Russia, this provision would prevent the United \nStates from addressing nuclear security concerns by improving physical security at certain \nRussian nuclear sites, which is an essential element of U.S. global efforts to combat the threat of \nnuclear terrorism. \n \nNonproliferation Construction Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility:  The \nAdministration appreciates the provisional flexibility in section 3113 to terminate the MOX \napproach to plutonium disposition, once certain conditions are met.  However, the \nAdministration objects to a delay in funding the alternative plutonium disposition option and the \neffort to require continued construction in support of the MOX approach.  Continuing \nconstruction, even temporarily, will result in additional millions of dollars being wasted rather \nthan being directed to the alternative disposition method.  The already-proven alternative method \nof disposition is expected to be significantly faster and less expensive than the MOX approach \nand has far lower risks.  Another important consideration is that the alternative to MOX would \nlikely enable the United States to remove plutonium from South Carolina decades sooner than \nMOX could.   \n \n7  Non-applicability of Certain Executive Orders to DOD and NNSA:  The Administration strongly \nobjects to section 1095, which would roll back important safeguards established by the President \nto ensure that taxpayer dollars do not reward corporations that break labor laws and thereby \njeopardize the performance and cost of Federal contracting.  These safeguards give Federal \ncontracting officers the information they need to assess a contractor's record of integrity and \nassist contractors with significant labor violations in improving their labor law compliance.  In \ndoing so, these protections help ensure that law-abiding contractors do not have to compete with \nthose who offer lower bids based on savings from skirting the law.  The Administration is \ncommitted to working with contractors who invest in their workers' safety and maintain a fair \nand equitable workplace, and section 1095 would impede efforts that will bring efficiencies and \ncost savings to the Federal Government. \n \nMissile Defense Programs:  While appreciating the Committee's support of DOD's ballistic \nmissile defense programs, the Administration strongly objects to section 1656, which would \nrequire the initiation of concept definition, design, research, development, and engineering \nevaluation and testing for a space-based intercept and defeat layer and space test bed.  There \ncurrently is no requirement for a space-based intercept and there are concerns about the technical \nfeasibility and long-term affordability of interceptors in space.  In addition, the Administration \nobjects to section 1663, which would direct the Director of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) \nto issue a request for proposal to procure a medium-range discrimination radar or equivalent \nsensor for the defense of Hawaii.  DOD is conducting a study to determine the appropriate \nbalance of sensors and locations to best defend the homeland, including Hawaii; it will be \ncompleted in the fourth quarter of FY 2016.  Section 1663 could limit the Administration's \nability to defend the entire homeland and the flexibility to apply the best capabilities to address \nrapidly evolving threats.  \n \nLimitation on Availability of Funds for Patriot Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Capability of \nthe Army:  The Administration objects to section 1658, which would infringe on the authority of \nthe Secretary of the Army to set forth, approve, and execute requirements.  It also would limit the \nArmy's flexibility to trade cost and performance with schedule to ensure a system is fielded that \nmeets requirements.   \n \nProhibition on Availability of Funds for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction System \n(CWMD) Constellation:  The Administration objects to section 216, which would prohibit the \nobligation and expenditure of any funds in FY 2017 for research, development, and prototyping \nof the CWMD situational awareness information system known as \"Constellation.\"  DOD is \ndeveloping and fielding a CWMD situational awareness system in response to requirements \narticulated by all combatant commands and validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight \nCouncil.  This capability is critical to anticipating weapons of mass destruction threats from \nnation-state and non-state actors and sharing information between DOD and its U.S. interagency \nand international partners.  The Constellation system will be deployed in July 2016 as a \ndevelopment prototype.  Prohibiting use of FY 2017 funds effectively terminates this important \ninitiative.  \n \nDefense Planning Guidance and Contingency Planning Guidance Information to Congress:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to provisions of section 904, which would direct the Secretary of \nDefense to submit to the Congressional defense Committees copies and detailed summaries of \nclassified aspects of defense planning guidance, raising constitutional concerns.  The defense \nplanning guidance informs the Department's internal force planning, resourcing, and acquisition \n8  processes, which collectively support the annual development and submission of the President's \nBudget.  Release of this guidance risks impairing the confidentiality of the Secretary's direction \nto Departmental Components, which contain sensitive national security information protected by \nexecutive privilege, and which directly informs both the development of Components' Program \nObjective Memorandums and decisions affecting Departmental programs in the Program and \nBudget Review process.  Regarding contingency planning, information about potential future \nmilitary operations used in the preparation of contingency plans is limited even within the \nDepartment to those individuals having a mission-critical role in the production, review, or \nexecution of those plans or operations.  Release of this information would interfere with the \nprerogative of the President and the Secretary of Defense to communicate direction to \nsubordinate military commanders containing sensitive national security information that is \nprotected by executive privilege.  In addition, the required inclusion in the guidance of \"any \nadditional or alternative views of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including any \nmilitary assessment of risks associated with the defense strategy,\" risks impairment of the \nDepartment's programs by compromising the candor and confidentiality of pre-decisional advice \ngiven to the Secretary of Defense and the President.   \n \nRole of Military Medical Treatment Facilities and Changes in Their Management:  The \nAdministration objects to provisions in sections 702 and 703.  Section 702 realigns the \nmanagement of Service military treatment facilities (MTFs) to the Director, Defense Health \nAgency (DHA).  This section raises serious concerns regarding reporting chains to Service \ncommands and DHA.  While this proposal seeks to gain standardization by centralizing decision \nauthority, the integration of the Services' MTF operating systems under the DHA would incur \nvery high costs and would compromise the effectiveness of the MTFs as readiness platforms \nsupporting the operational warfighter.  Section 703 defines criteria for MTF types based on the \navailability of civilian health care in the surrounding geographical areas without regard to the \nreadiness requirements of military medical providers.  Both of these provisions raise serious \nconcerns about the interplay between operational readiness requirements and health delivery.  \nThe Department looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve comprehensive reform \nof the Military Health System that carefully considers all of these matters.  \n \nMilitary Response Options to Russian Federation Violation of Intermediate-Range Nuclear \nForces (INF) Treaty:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1232 which makes some \nDOD funding in support of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) contingent upon \nsubmission of a report by the Secretary of Defense.  DOD provides support to the EOP that is \nentirely unrelated to the INF Treaty, including the White House Military Office that provides \ndirect support to the President for transportation, communications, and emergency medical \nservices.  Limiting these funds will also have a negative impact on the ability of the EOP to \nmanage and oversee vital national security defense policy development and implementation.   \n \nOpen Skies Treaty:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1231, which would \neffectively prohibit the expenditure of funds pertaining to the Open Skies Treaty.  This would \npreclude U.S. participation in certification of Russian infra-red (IR) and synthetic aperture radar \n(SAR) sensors, which in turn would prevent the United States from objecting to the certification \nof these aircraft and sensors.  Meanwhile, other State Parties could certify a Russian aircraft \nequipped with IR and SAR sensors.  Section 1231 would also prohibit the expenditure of funds \nto accept an initial Russian observation flight equipped with IR and SAR sensors, preventing the \nUnited States from fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty, which was ratified by the President \nand for which the Senate provided its advice and overwhelming consent.  Also, the 14 day \n9  reporting requirement imposed by the NDAA would be impossible to meet because treaty \nprocedures allow 15 days for data processing to verify treaty compliance, and the Department \nwould need additional time to transport and analyze the data. \n \nNew START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty):  The Administration strongly objects to section \n1645, which would make the obligation and expenditure of DOD funds to extend the New \nSTART Treaty dependent upon the submission of onerous and duplicative reporting on arms \ncontrol and military balance issues.  This provision would impede the United States from \nexercising an existing right under the Treaty, which was ratified by the President with the advice \nand consent of the Senate in 2010.  With implementation of the Treaty well underway, a decision \nto extend the Treaty in order to constrain Russia's strategic nuclear forces for an additional five \nyears rests with the President in his capacity as commander-in-chief.  In addition, section 1645 \nwould require the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to report to Congress on the Treaty's \nnational security value to the United States, a determination that should take into account the \nviews of the entire Executive Branch, including the Intelligence Community (IC).  Similarly, this \nprovision assigns to the Director of National Intelligence the sole responsibility to report on \nRussia's compliance with its arms control obligations. Section 403 of the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2593a), already requires a report by the President on \nAdherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament \nAgreements and Commitments.  By Executive Order, the State Department produces and submits \nto Congress this report, in coordination with the Departments of Defense and Energy, as well as \nthe IC.  \n \nAfghan Special Immigrant Visas (SIV):  The Administration objects to the lack of authorization \nin section 1216 for additional visas for the Afghan SIV program, which would enable Afghan \nnationals who have aided U.S. efforts through their work, and who experience an ongoing \nserious threat as a result, to apply for these visas.  Additional numbers will be necessary to issue \nvisas to all qualified applicants under current law. Further, the Administration strongly objects to \nthe proposed dramatic cut back in section 1216 of the scope of eligibility for Afghans who have \nworked for the U.S. Government other than supporting its military forces.  By narrowing \neligibility, the program would erode the expectations of hundreds of Afghan staff whose lives \nremain in danger because of their work for the U.S. mission and also make it more difficult to \nhire and retain qualified Afghan staff who are essential to achieving our diplomatic and \nassistance goals. \n \nInnovation and Access to Non-Traditional Suppliers:  The Administration objects to the \nauthorization reduction and flexibility limitations in section 217 on programs that seek to \nbroaden DOD's access to innovative companies and technologies.  Specifically, the \nAdministration is concerned with the complete elimination of the investment funding associated \nwith the Defense Innovation Unit Experiment, as well as the reduction in funding for the \nStrategic Capabilities Office and In-Q-Tel's efforts to explore innovative technologies that enable \nthe efficient incorporation into weapons systems and operations capabilities.  While relatively \nmodest compared to the Department's overall budget, these investments will enable the \ndevelopment of leading-edge, primarily asymmetric capabilities and help spur development of \nnew ways of warfighting to counter advanced adversaries. In order to sustain technological \nsuperiority, the Department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging commercial \ntechnologies that, when integrated with military systems and novel concept of operations, will be \na source of battlefield advantage. \n \n10  Providing Footwear to Recruits at Initial Entry Training:  The Administration objects to section \n808, which would require the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to provide athletic \nfootwear directly to recruits upon their entry into the Armed Forces instead of providing a cash \nallowance for the purchase of such footwear, at the choice of the recruit.  Because it is likely that \nonly one company could benefit disproportionately from such DOD purchasing requirements, \nthis provision essentially serves as preferential arrangement for a particular company.  \nMandating that a specific article of clothing be provided to new recruits is unprecedented and, in \nthe case of athletic shoes, runs counter to research that indicates a strong correlation between the \nvariety of athletic shoes available, fit, and comfort, and reduced injury rates.  Forcing DOD into \na \"one size fits all\" approach to athletic footwear may contribute to a higher incidence of injury \nto new recruits during one of the most critical times in a member's military training.  DOD places \nthe health of our service members above all other considerations.  \n \nProhibition on Per Diem Allowance Reductions Based on the Duration of Temporary Duty \nAssignment or Civilian Travel:  The Administration objects to section 603, which would prohibit \na reduced flat per diem rate for uniformed service members and DOD civilian employees who \ntravel to one location for more than 30 days.  This prohibition, which applies only to the \nDepartment, is contrary to the growing Government-wide trend toward implementing flat rate \nper diem for long-term travel. Section 603 would nullify an evidence-based policy decision that \ncompensates DOD travelers for the expenses incurred, demonstrates the Department's \nstewardship of taxpayer funds, and meets external mandates to simplify travel and reduce costs. \nThe significant increased costs would negate annual programmed savings affecting force \nreadiness and reduce the Department's ability to fully fund official travel by imposing an \nunfunded annual requirement on the military departments.  The prohibition would add $56 \nmillion or more annually to the Department's travel costs.  \n \nClarification of Contracts Covered by Airlift Service Provision:  The Administration objects to \nsection 1085, which would expand the definition of a \"contract for airlift service\" to include any \nDOD contract in which \"transportation services are used in the performance of the contract or \nany subcontract (at any tier).\"  Section 9516 of title 10, United States Code, requires DOD \ncontracts for airlift services involving transportation by aircraft eligible for the Civil Reserve Air \nFleet program to be awarded to air carriers in the program.  Section 1085 would significantly \nexpand the range of contracts to which section 9516 applies and affect hundreds, if not \nthousands, of DOD contracts for supplies and services in which the use of air transportation is \nincidental to the performance of the contract or subcontracts at every tier.  This provision would \nprovide little benefit to DOD, restrict the Department's operational flexibility, significantly \nincrease costs to the taxpayer, and place impractical and unnecessary constraints on DOD \ncontracts.  \n \nPlans on Transfer of Acquisition and Funding Authority of Certain Weather Missions to National \nReconnaissance Office (NRO):  The Administration objects to section 1609, which would \ntransfer acquisition and funding authority for some environmental monitoring missions from the \nAir Force to the NRO.  The DOD weather enterprise should be managed as an integrated \nmission.  The Air Force currently provides space-based environmental monitoring systems, \nservices, and data products to support a large number of strategic and tactical users.  Section \n1609 would make integrated sensor collection, mission management, data processing, and \nforecasting less efficient by segregating overlapping requirements across multiple organizations.  \nManaging the DOD weather enterprise as a whole is the most affordable and effective way to \nmeet warfighter requirements within available resources.  There is currently no Air Force \n11  investment funding for a cloud characterization and theater weather imagery system or capability \nthat could be transferred to the NRO.  \n \nHypersonic Boost Glide Vehicle Defense:  While appreciating the Committee's support to ensure \ndefense against hypersonic boost glide vehicles, the Administration objects to section 1657, \nwhich would direct the Director of the MDA to establish a program of record.  This provision \ncould limit the Administration's ability to establish the best Service or Agency to establish a \nprogram of record to defend against hypersonic boost glide vehicles.  \n \nEstablishment of Unified Combatant Command for Cyber Operations:  The Administration \nappreciates the Committee's support for DOD's cyber mission and forces, but objects to \nstatutorily requiring the establishment of a unified combatant command for cyber operations in \nsection 911.  The Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should retain \nthe flexibility to recommend to the President changes to the unified command plan that they \nbelieve would most effectively organize the military to address an ever-evolving threat \nenvironment.  \n \nRestructuring of the Distributed Common Ground System of the Army (DCGS-A):  The \nAdministration objects to section 219, which would restrict the development and integration of \nDCGS-A Increment 2 components where a commercial software is capable of fulfilling at least \n80 percent of the component's requirement.  This provision is duplicative and unnecessary and \nmandates a commercial solution without regard for price, ability to support a modular open \nsystem architecture, or cost associated with proprietary software maintenance.  In practice, the \nprovision could mandate acquisition of a system comprised of commercial products that do not \nfully meet required Key Performance Parameters without due consideration of integration costs \nand schedule impacts, putting the system's affordability, functionality, and interoperability at \nrisk.  \n \nConsolidation of Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Functions of the Air \nForce:  The Administration objects to section 1646, which would require the Air Force to \nconsolidate NC3 under a single commander and include the Integrated Tactical Warning and \nAttack Assessment (ITW/AA) system as a part of NC3.  The Administration objects to the \ninclusion of ITW/AA within NC3 because it would fracture the space and missile-warning \nenterprise and adversely affect critical missile-warning and air defense operations.  Furthermore, \nthe consolidation would violate Commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command \n(NORAD) authorities for executing NORAD's aerospace warning mission and, thus, would \nrequire revision of the U.S. bi-national agreement with Canada.  Also, the Air Force has already \nmade significant progress towards consolidating the mission under a single commander \n(Commander of Air Force Global Strike Command).  \n \nJoint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF):  While the Administration \nappreciates the Committee expanding the authority to interdict improvised explosive device \nprecursor chemicals in foreign countries of concern, section 1532 fails to address the successor \nfund to the JIEDDF mandated by the NDAA for FY 2016.  Without the authorization of the \nJIEDDF, the successor fund proposed by DOD, the Administration is constrained in its ability to \nrapidly respond to non-traditional, unanticipated improvised threats on the battlefield and to \nprotect against the rapidly emerging improvised threats currently faced by U.S. forces.  \n \n12  Reduction in General Officer and Flag Officer Grades and Positions:  While the Administration \nsupports simplifying and improving command and control of the military, particularly where the \nnumber of four-star positions have made headquarters either top-heavy or less efficient, it objects \nto section 910, which would limit the grade of service or functional component commanders of \ncombatant commands to be no higher than lieutenant general or vice admiral, and reduce the \ntotal number of officers serving in the grade of general or admiral by five.  The Administration \nintends to reduce the number of four-star positions and across-the-board mandated reductions are \nunnecessary.    \n \nRestriction on the Application of the Prohibition on Performance of Non-Defense Audits by \nDefense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA):  The Administration strongly objects to section 840, \nwhich provides a limited roll-back of the prohibition on performance of non-defense audits by \nDCAA.  The Administration recommends simply rescinding the prohibition on performance of \nnon-defense audits contained in section 893 of the FY 2016 NDAA.  Maintaining the current \nprohibition on performance of non-defense agencies by DCAA extends the length of time it \nwould take DCAA to reduce its incurred cost backlog and creates additional burdens and audit \ninefficiencies on the audit process for both contractors and Government agencies.  The \nrequirement in the Committee report for a comprehensive review by the Comptroller General of \nthe United States of DCAA's current backlog is a more appropriate vehicle to identify potential \nremedies to address DCAA's incurred cost backlog.  \n \nDual Status Military Technicians:  The Administration objects to section 514, which would \nexempt dual status military technicians from civilian employee furloughs.  Military technicians \nare civilian employees and should be treated in the same manner as all Federal civilian \nemployees.  As civilian employees, there are civilian furlough exemptions allowed by statute that \nwould permit certain technicians to continue working.  In addition, in the event of an emergency, \nthese personnel could be activated, at which point they would convert to military status and \nwould no longer be subject to furlough. \n \nUnobligated Balances Reductions:  The Administration objects to the $2 billion reduction for \nunobligated balances across multiple appropriations.  For Operation and Maintenance \nappropriations, $1.1 billion of the reductions will only be applied to those programs funded in \nsection 4301, which include the military services' readiness, depot maintenance, base operations \nsupport, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions \nwill delay the Department's full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of \nmaintenance at the services' depot facilities.  As part of the budget analysis, the Department \nreviewed the services' unobligated balances and realigned savings from historically \nunderperforming accounts into readiness and operations accounts for FY 2017.  The remaining \n$200 million reduction for Operation and Maintenance unobligated balances will affect Army \nOperation and Maintenance programs funded in section 4302, which include contingency \noperations and reset.  This reduction will delay the Department's efforts to support ongoing \noverseas contingency operations and reset for equipment returning from theater.  \n \nNational Biodefense Strategy:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1086 which would \nrequire the Secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and \nAgriculture to jointly develop a biodefense strategy and an associated implementation plan.  The \nExecutive Branch already works under several existing Presidential Policy Directives covering \nbiodefense and these make section 1086 redundant.  Additionally, biodefense is a cross agency \nnational security priority that needs to be coordinated by the EOP.  As such, the National \n13  Security Council staff is currently working with all relevant departments and agencies to \ndevelop, coordinate, implement and review biodefense efforts. Implementing a new structure and \nprocess outside of the normal Executive Branch coordinating mechanism will lead to confusion, \nand may slow or reverse the strong progress the agencies have made in developing robust \nbiodefense programs.   \n \nJoint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF):  The Administration objects to the elimination \nof its base funding JUONF request of $99.3 million.  This funding is vital to the Department's \nability to quickly begin responding to urgent operational needs.  Eliminating this funding may \nincrease life-threatening risks to service members and contribute to critical mission failures.  \n \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Reform:  The Administration appreciates that the bill \nadopts a number of the UCMJ reforms proposed by the Administration, including enhanced \nvictims' rights (including anti-retaliatory measures), improvements to trial procedures, and \nupdated sentencing guidelines.  \n \nHousing Unaccompanied Children:  The Administration strongly objects to section 2812, which \nwould prohibit the use of a military installation located in the United States to house any \nunaccompanied child.  The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee \nResettlement (ORR) is required by law to provide for the shelter, care, and placement of \nunaccompanied children referred to its custody. The number of children referred to ORR custody \nis difficult to predict and fluctuates throughout the year. As a result, ORR continually works to \nidentify shelter options in the event of caseload increases, including space to temporarily house \nchildren when standard capacity is exceeded. These additional shelter options may include, but \nare not limited to, DOD facilities.  DOD assists with the identification of those sites to ensure \nthat such use would not adversely impact DOD operations.  In addition, ORR reimburses DOD \nfor the temporary use of DOD facilities and children are not cared for by DOD personnel. Given \nthe unpredictability of flows in unaccompanied children arrivals, limiting the available shelter \noptions would present serious difficulties for ORR contingency planning and would likely \nincrease costs to U.S. taxpayers. \n \nPersonnel Provisions:  The Administration has concerns with section 1109, which would limit \nthe period of time for which an employee of the Federal Government may be put on \nadministrative leave.  The provision substantially limits Federal agencies' discretion, would be \nadministratively burdensome, and, in many cases, would not allow time for the agency to \nthoroughly investigate and adjudicate issues in a legally defensible manner due to many factors.  \nSection 1109 could also pose safety and national security issues, as it would restrain an agency's \nuse of administrative leave in conjunction with a proposed adverse action and where an agency \nbelieves the employee may otherwise pose a threat to safety and security in the workplace, or to \nthe proper safeguarding of sensitive information or operations.  Further, for IC agencies, the \nrequirement for notice to Congressional committees other than their authorizing committees \ncould create unacceptable counterintelligence or security risks.  The Administration also has \nconcerns with section 1110, which would require an agency head to make a permanent personnel \nfile notation for an individual who resigns while under investigation if an adverse finding is \nmade. This section would be difficult to implement because it is unclear what would be expected \nof an agency under these circumstances since they are often precluded from taking any \ndisciplinary action against individuals who are no longer employed by the agency.  While section \n1110 would provide for a process for notification and appeals, the process in and of itself would \nnot correct the inherent flaw of placing a notation in an individual's official personnel file based \n14  on what may be an incomplete investigation, and without a full determination by the agency that \nan adverse personnel action would have been warranted.   \n \nSmall Business Set-Aside Threshold:  The Administration strongly opposes section 1804, which \nwould synchronize the dollar amount of the statutory small business set-aside threshold in the \nSmall Business Act to the level of the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT).  The \nAdministration seeks to increase the SAT from its current level of $150,000 to $500,000 in order \nto make transacting with the Government easier and less costly for contractors, including many \nenterprising small businesses offering emerging technologies that can be used to fight cyber-\nattacks and support forward-leaning twenty-first century digital activities.   Despite the important \nbenefits associated with raising the SAT, a parallel increase in the set-aside threshold could, by \nsignificantly reducing the value of procurements accessible to them, create friction with our trade \nagreement partners, who could seek to retaliate by reducing the ability of U.S. small businesses \nfrom competing for Government procurement contracts in their markets.  Small businesses \nalready receive a significant portion of Federal contract work between $150,000 and $500,000 \nand do not require imposition of the statutory set-aside in order to effectively compete for and \nreceive work from the Government under $500,000. \n \nExemptions to Civil Rights Laws:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1094, which \nwould undermine important protections put in place by the President to ensure that Federal \ncontractors and subcontractors do not engage in discriminatory employment practices.  This \nAdministration is committed to promoting equal employment opportunities for all Americans \nregardless of who they are or who they love while at the same time preserving longstanding \nsafeguards in the law for religious liberty, including the religious exemption codified in Title VII \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  In authorizing certain Federal awardees to discriminate in \nGovernment-funded jobs, section 1094 represents a step in the wrong direction for our country \nthat will keep qualified American workers from being able to hold jobs funded by the American \npeople.   \nSupply of Specialty Motors from Certain Manufacturers:  The Administration objects to section \n346 because this provision would erode energy and consumer cost savings from the final rule \nthat amended the energy conservation standards for electric motors, undermine the Department \nof Energy's consensus agreement that involved a wide range of stakeholders in the rulemaking \nprocess, and exploit the loopholes that exist in the current regulations by allowing small \nbusinesses not to comply. This provision could harm domestic businesses and further complicate \nthe market as cheap imports could also exploit this proposal. \n \nImpairment of Endangered Species Act (ESA) Conservation and Public Land Management:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to sections 2864 and 2865, which undermine State and Federal \ncooperative efforts to protect the Greater Sage Grouse and Lesser Prairie Chicken, as well as \nSection 2866, which removes the American Burying Beetle from the Endangered Species List. \nSection 2864 would effectively override longstanding principles of major Federal land \nmanagement statutes, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the National \nForest Management Act.  Congressionally-mandated removal from the Endangered Species List, \ndelays in determining species status, and State control over Federal public lands undermine the \nscience-based decision-making at the core of the ESA, are unnecessary for military readiness, \nand are ill-advised for purposes of public land management.  These provisions are non-germane \nto the NDAA, would impair the protection afforded by the ESA, and undermine years of \ncollaborative conservation work with private landowners, States, and other stakeholders. \n \n15  The National Historic Preservation Act:  The Administration objects to section 2855, which \nwould amend the National Historic Preservation Act to allow Federal agencies to object to a \ndesignation of Federal properties for reasons of national security.  Listing a property on the \nNational Register of Historic Places, or designating it as a National Historic Landmark, does not \nlimit any Federal agency's decision-making authority.  Decisions on how to manage the property, \ninformed by the evaluation of its significance and integrity, remain the responsibility of the \nagency with jurisdiction over that property.  The Administration is not aware of any specific \ninstance where such a designation has adversely affected national security. Enactment of this \nsection could lead to a fundamental weakening of highly successful and widely admired \nprograms that Congress intended to help recognize and protect our shared heritage. \n \nMilitary Land Withdrawals:  The Administration has concerns with sections 2841 and 2842 \nrelating to military land withdrawals.  With regard to the provisions applicable to public lands, \nthe responsible agencies will continue to coordinate to facilitate responsible use of public lands \nto support military readiness, training, and testing, acknowledging the current system of periodic \nlegislative re-withdrawals is not particularly efficient and does not provide for the optimum land \nmanagement regime.  However, the Administration is not prepared to support transfers of such \nlands without a process that provides careful consideration of the evolving needs, interests, and \nany supporting legislative provisions.  The Administration stands ready to consider measures and \napproaches to make the use of public lands for military needs more efficient.  The \nAdministration cannot support provisions that would alter the current use and management \nstructure of the Desert National Wildlife Refuge and strongly opposes provisions that could \nallow unrestricted Air Force activities in areas of the Refuge.  The Administration also \nrecommends adoption of its proposal to standardize various land withdrawal termination dates, a \nmeasure that was replaced by the current section 2841. \n \nUtah Test and Training Range:  While the Administration supports the appropriate and \nresponsible use of public lands for military purposes, the Administration opposes provisions in \nTitle XXX that would prevent the effective management of Federal lands, including those \nproposed for temporary use and closure.  Further the Administration strongly objects to \nexchanges of Federal land in Utah without adequate consideration to the Federal taxpayer or \nNEPA contained in section 3023 and to section 3031, which would recognize the existence and \nvalidity of unsubstantiated and disputed claims of road rights-of-way across Federal lands in \nUtah.  These sections are not necessary to further the military mission of the Utah Test and \nTraining Range.  \n \nBallast Water:  The Administration objects to Title XXXVI, which undermines the ability to \nfight the spread of invasive species in our Nation's waters because it, in part: would lack critical \ncivil and criminal enforcement mechanisms present in the existing statutory and regulatory \nregime, the absence of which would irreparably hinder the successful prosecution of unlawful \ndischarges; would effectively discard the existing body of domestic environmental laws as those \nlaws apply to vessel discharges; would jettison well-established statutory and regulatory regimes \nthat implement U.S. international legal obligations; and would fail to preserve expressly the \nauthorities of the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to exercise \nadministrative control over waters under each Secretary's jurisdiction.   \n \nMaritime Administration/U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Restrictions:  The Administration \nopposes sections 3507 and 3508.  Section 3507 would preclude many qualified candidates with \nexperience in managing higher learning institutions from applying for the position of \n16  Superintendent or Commandant and would interfere in the operation of an institution of higher \nlearning which could adversely impact its accreditation.  Section 3508 would eliminate \nMARAD's ability to use sales proceeds from National Defense Reserve Fleet non-retention \nvessels, leaving MARAD without funding to manage its 7,000 maritime heritage assets, many of \nwhich are on loan to maritime museums and other organizations throughout the country. \n \nRemoval of Commissioned Officers:  Section 503 would amend 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1161 to authorize \nthe Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is \noperating, to remove commissioned officers in certain enumerated \ncircumstances.  Commissioned officers are appointed either by the President with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 531(a)(2)) or by the President alone (10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 531(a)(1)).  Authorizing a subordinate official other than the President to remove an officer \nwhom the President has appointed raises constitutional concerns under the Appointments and \nTake Care Clauses.  The Administration would be happy to provide technical assistance to the \nCongress in achieving the aims of section 503 through other constitutional means.  \n \nSenior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC)  Programs at Schools That Display the \nConfederate Battle Flag:  Section 567 would prohibit the Secretaries of military departments \nfrom establishing, maintaining, or supporting an ROTC program at any educational institution \nthat displays the Confederate battle flag anywhere on campus other than in a museum exhibit.  \nThe Administration strongly supports the removal of the Confederate battle flag\u2014a divisive \nsymbol and reminder of systematic oppression and racial subjugation\u2014from the Nation's \nuniversities and other institutions.  Cutting off Federal funding for a ROTC program on the \nground that an institution displays the flag, however, raises First Amendment concerns.  The \nAdministration therefore urges Congress to pursue this important objective through other means. \n \nOther Constitutional Concerns:  In addition, certain other provisions in this bill raise \nconstitutional concerns, including interference with the President's exclusive authority to \nrecognize foreign nations (section 1236) and to engage in the conduct of diplomacy (section \n1234).   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n17  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n) \n  June 1, 2015 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2577 \u2014 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2016 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2577, making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The bill freezes or cuts critical \ninvestment in transportation that creates jobs, helps to grow the economy, and improves \nAmerica's roads, bridges, transit infrastructure, and aviation systems, benefiting towns and cities \nacross the United States, as well as investments in ending homelessness, strengthening \ncommunities, and providing rental housing assistance for poor and vulnerable families.  At a \ntime when only one in four families who are eligible for housing assistance actually receives it, \nthe bill would set back efforts to end homelessness and shortchange housing support for very \nlow-income households, including families with children, the elderly, and the disabled.  The bill \nalso reduces funding for other vulnerable populations, such as low-income children at risk of \nlead poisoning, and for programs that invest in public housing to revitalize distressed \ncommunities.  Furthermore, the legislation includes highly objectionable provisions, including \nprovisions that would restrict travel to Cuba, undercut public safety, and limit State and local \nchoices to enhance passenger rail.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2577, his senior \nadvisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \nEnacting H.R. 2577 and adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending \nlimits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-\nclass priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to \nthreaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be \nmotivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The \nRepublican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense \nfor FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts \nwould result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head \nStart, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and \nthousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and grants, adversely impacting the pace \nof discovery and innovation, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle \nclass, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.   \n \nSequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only \nthrough pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland \nSecurity, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of \nour economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear \nthat he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense \nwithout also fixing non-defense.     \nThe President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2577 and any other \nlegislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the \ninvestments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense \npriorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members \nof Congress from both parties have urged.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) \n \nSurface Transportation Funding.  The Administration strongly opposes the reductions in funding \nfor surface transportation programs, which would essentially preclude new investments while \nfreezing or reducing most major capital accounts below prior-year funding.  The President's \nFY 2016 Budget request is a fully-paid-for plan for six years of increased investment in \nAmerica's infrastructure.  The $478 billion multimodal proposal includes essential program \nimprovements that would improve safety, support critical infrastructure projects, and create jobs \nwhile improving America's roads, bridges, transit systems and railways in cities, fast-growing \nmetropolitan areas, small towns and rural communities across the United States.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact the GROW AMERICA \nproposal.  \n \nAmtrak and Rail Safety.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to support the \nPresident's FY 2016 Budget request for current passenger rail service, totaling nearly $2.5 \nbillion, and fully fund the request for the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) Safety and \nOperations account.  The requested funding for passenger rail service would help bring Amtrak's \nNortheast Corridor infrastructure and equipment into a state of good repair, implement Positive \nTrain Control on Amtrak routes, and support rail service at a time of record ridership.  Rather \nthan including funds for those critical investments, the bill reduces Amtrak grants by more than \n$1.3 billion below the FY 2016 Budget request and $250 million below last year's level.  In \naddition, the bill holds FRA's Safety and Operations account flat at FY 2015 levels, denying \nresources for additional safety inspectors and other improvements. \n \nRestricting Travel to Cuba.  The Administration strongly objects to language in sections 193 and \n414 that would restrict flights and cruise ships from going to Cuba and would place unnecessary \nrestrictions on options for educational, religious, or other permitted travel to Cuba.   \n \nTransportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.  Compared to the \nFY 2016 Budget request, the bill would reduce funding for competitive TIGER grants by over a \nbillion dollars, reducing TIGER funding to about 80 percent below the lowest level since the \nprogram began in FY 2009.  This is despite the fact that the program is vastly oversubscribed due \nto strong State and local interest, supports some of the most transformative highway, port, and \ntransit projects in the United States, and helps State and local partners leverage public and \nprivate dollars.  \n \nFederal Transit Administration (FTA) Capital Investment Grants.  The Administration strongly \nurges the Congress to fund the requested $3.25 billion for the FTA Capital Investment Grant \n2  Program, which provides a share of funding for locally planned, implemented and operated \ntransit capital investments that improve capacity in communities nationwide.  \n \nHigh Speed Rail.  The Administration also strongly objects to language in section 192 of the bill \nprohibiting the Surface Transportation Board from taking any action to approve subsequent \nphases of the California High Speed Rail project between Los Angeles and San Francisco unless \nthe Surface Transportation Board issues a permit for the entire project.  The Administration \nbelieves passenger rail can play an important role in addressing transportation needs in many \nparts of the Nation and opposes any attempts to limit State and local choices to enhance \npassenger rail.   \n \nInfrastructure Permitting Center.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not provide \nthe requested funding level of $4 million for the Interagency Infrastructure Permitting \nImprovement Center, which is essential for developing and implementing reforms that will \naccelerate and improve the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects.  These funds \nare also critically needed to develop and deploy information technology tools to help track \nproject metrics and schedules that will lead to greater accountability and transparency.   \n \nFederal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Facilities and Equipment account.  The bill provides \n$2.5 billion for the FAA Facilities and Equipment account, $355 million below the FY 2016 \nBudget request and the lowest funding level in 15 years, even before taking into account \ninflation.  At this level, the FAA would be hampered in its ability to maintain the capacity and \nsafety of the current National Airspace System and would be required to slow the modernization \nof the Nation's air traffic system through NextGen\u2014the next generation of air traffic control \ntechnology.  Continuing to defer maintenance would deteriorate the current air traffic control \nsystem, and coupling that deterioration with delaying NextGen could lead to worsening air traffic \ndelays and higher replacement costs in the future.   \n \nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).  The Administration is strongly \nconcerned about the dramatic reduction in funding for transit services in the Nation's capital.  \nThe bill would reduce funding for WMATA from the FY 2016 Budget request of $150 million, \nwhich is consistent with enacted appropriations for FY 2015 and previous years, to $100 million.  \nThese reductions could jeopardize the safety improvements that WMATA is in the process of \nmaking.   \n \nSafe Transport of Energy Products.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not \nprovide adequate funding for the Department to continue and further its focus on the safe \nmovement of energy products throughout the transportation system by supporting enhanced \ninspection levels, investigative efforts, research and data analysis and testing in the highest \nrisk areas.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides an increase of $8 million for \nthe Hazardous Materials Safety account.  However, holding the Federal Railroad \nAdministration's Safety and Operations account flat at FY 2015 funding levels inhibits its \nability to hire critically needed safety inspectors to focus on the movement of crude oil across \nthe Nation.   \n \nHighway and Motor Carrier Safety.  The Administration strongly objects to language in sections \n124, 125, 126, and 132 that would undercut public safety, including by letting the trucking \nindustry avoid truck size and weight limits and by preventing data-driven changes that would \nimprove safety for all travelers by addressing truck driver fatigue (\"Hours of Service\").  In \n3  particular, section 132 would undermine the Administration's existing regulatory work to ensure \nappropriate standards for commercial truck drivers' rest.  The bill imposes criteria that would in \nall likelihood be impossible to meet, therefore preventing critical safety provisions from taking \neffect.  This provision combined with the troubling changes to truck size and weight limit could \nsignificantly compromise safety on our Nation's roads.   \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the \nCongress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request for DOT to implement the DATA Act.  This \nfunding will support the Department's efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, \nsuch as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and employing a \nuniform procurement instrument identifier.  \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 \nBudget request for DOT to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding will support the \nDepartment in managing the agency's digital services that have the greatest impact to citizens \nand businesses. \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nHousing Choice Vouchers.  The Administration strongly objects to the $19.9 billion in funding \nprovided for the Housing Choice Vouchers program.  This funding level is $1.2 billion less than \nthe FY 2016 Budget request and fails to restore the 67,000 vouchers lost due to the FY 2013 \nsequestration, is insufficient to renew 28,000 existing vouchers, and does not provide full \nfunding for tenant protection needs.  The bill also provides inadequate funding for the Voucher \nprogram's administrative fees so that Public Housing Authorities can ensure that units are safe \nand habitable.  These reductions are only more problematic in light of new research released \nrecently that found large positive effects of housing vouchers on long-term educational and \nearnings outcomes for young children.  \n \nChoice Neighborhoods.  The Administration strongly opposes the $20 million funding level \nprovided for Choice Neighborhoods, a key part of the President's Promise Zones initiative to \naccelerate economic mobility and revitalization in high-poverty communities.  This reduction of \n75 percent from the FY 2015 level and $230 million below the President's FY 2016 Budget \nrequest would leave the program unable to fund even a single implementation grant at the \naverage current grant size, leaving dozens of distressed communities untouched.  This reduction \nis particularly problematic given how recent research mentioned above and events in Baltimore \nand other communities make clear the negative consequences of concentrated poverty for \nchildren. \n \nHomeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration strongly opposes the funding level for \nHomeless Assistance Grants, which is $295 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  Since \nFY 2010, the Administration has made substantial progress toward the goal of ending \nhomelessness; the bill would set back these efforts, supporting 15,000 fewer homeless or at-risk \nfamilies with rapid rehousing and 25,500 fewer units of permanent supportive housing targeted \nto the chronically homeless.   \n \nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) Administrative Fee and Funding.  The Administration \nurges the Congress to adopt the proposed new fee on FHA lenders and provide the full FY 2016 \nBudget request of $174 million for FHA administrative expenses.  The request would lower \n4  taxpayer risks and improve access to mortgage credit for underserved borrowers by enabling \nFHA to both strengthen and clarify its lender oversight and compliance policies.   \n \nHOME/Housing Trust Fund (HTF).  The Administration strongly opposes the $767 million \nfunding level for HOME, a reduction of more than $130 million from its FY 2015 funding level, \nand the bill's diversion of anticipated HTF collections to the HOME program.  By transferring \nfunds from HTF to HOME, the bill effectively eliminates the HTF program, and provides $283 \nmillion, or 24 percent, less than the FY 2016 Budget request for these two programs.  The \nAdministration strongly urges the Congress to support HOME and the HTF, as each program \ncomplements the work of local leaders to develop affordable housing for both extremely low- \nand low-income families.   \n \nHousing Counseling.  The Administration opposes the $47 million in funding for HUD's \nHousing Counseling program, which is $13 million, or 22 percent, below the FY 2016 Budget \nrequest.  Housing counseling is an important resource in helping households achieve sustainable \nhomeownership or find quality, affordable rental housing.   \n \nLead Hazard and Healthy Homes.  The Administration strongly opposes the $75 million funding \nlevel for HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes.  This level, which is more \nthan 30 percent below its FY 2015 funding level and $45 million below the FY 2016 Budget \nrequest would result in at least 3,400 fewer low-income children receiving lead hazard control in \ntheir homes.   \n \nPublic Housing Programs.  The Administration opposes the $6.1 billion in funding provided for \nthe Public Housing Operating Fund and Capital Fund programs.  This funding level is $449 \nmillion below the FY 2016 Budget request, and would delay necessary maintenance and capital \nimprovements that would improve the deteriorating living conditions of low-income families.  \nThe Administration also urges the Congress to provide the $50 million requested for the Rental \nAssistance Demonstration (RAD) and to eliminate the 185,000 unit cap on RAD to preserve \nadditional underfunded public housing properties at risk of loss, by converting them to long-term \nSection 8 contracts.  \n \nInformation Technology (IT) and Digital Services.  The Administration strongly opposes the \n$100 million appropriation for HUD's Information Technology Fund, $234 million below the \nFY 2016 Budget request.  This funding level provides HUD with less than half of the necessary \nfunding for basic IT operations and would likely require shutdown of core IT systems as well as \ncancellation or deferral of all development, modernization and enhancement projects, putting \nevery element of HUD's core mission at risk.  Further, the failure to fund a U.S. Digital Service \nteam represents a missed opportunity to improve key agency services and programs that impact \nthe public.  \n \nTechnical Assistance and Research.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide sufficient \nfunding for technical assistance and research, which are critical to support effective operation of \nHUD programs and inform sound policymaking.  The bill provides no funding for technical \nassistance and only $52.5 million for research, which in total is $77.5 million below the FY 2016 \nBudget request.   \n \nEnergy Efficiency Requirements in HUD-Assisted Housing.  The Administration opposes the \ninclusion of language in section 232 that would undermine Federal energy efficiency \n5  requirements in HUD-assisted housing by prohibiting the use of FY 2016 funding to require \nenergy efficiency standards in HUD-funded construction that exceed that of State or local \nbuilding codes.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n6  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nMay 24, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5233 \u2013 Clarifying Congressional Intent in Providing for DC Home Rule Act of 2016 \n(Rep. Meadows, R-NC, and Rep.

The Administration \nstrongly supports home rule for the District and the President has long called for authority \nallowing the District to spend its own local taxes and other non-Federal funds without \ncongressional approval.   \n \nThe Administration is disappointed that the Congress has failed to provide elected leaders in the \nNation's capital the most basic authority to spend local tax collections without congressional \napproval, an authority held by local officials across the Nation.  Subjecting the District to the \nlengthy and uncertain congressional appropriations process for its use of local tax collections \nimposes both operational and financial hardships on the District, burdens not borne by any other \nlocal government in the country.  The residents of the District and their elected leaders deserve to \nhave the same ability as other U.S. residents and elected leaders to determine how to use their \nlocal revenues to address their unique needs.  Such authority is fundamental to a \nwell-functioning democracy, and the Congress denying the District this authority is an affront to \nthe residents and elected leaders of the District.  \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5233, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "EXECUTIVE  OFFICE  OF  THE  PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE  OF  MANAGEMENT  AND  BUDGET\n  \nWASHINGTON,  D.

Poliquin, R-ME, and one  cosponsor)  \n \nThe Administration shares the Congress'  goals of increasing transparency and bringing  Iran into compliance  \nwith international standards in the global fight against terror finance and money laundering.  However, this \nbill would be counterproductive toward those shared goals.  \n \nThe bill requires the U.S. Government to publicly  report all assets held by some of  Iran's highest leaders and \nto describe how these assets are  acquired and used.  Rather than preventing  terrorist financing  and  money  \nlaundering, this bill would incentivize those involved to make their financial dealings less transparent and \ncreate a disincentive  for  Iran's banking sector to demonstrate transparency.  These onerous reporting  \nrequirements also would take critical resources away  from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's important \nwork to identify  Iranian entities engaged in sanctionable conduct.  Producing this information could also \ncompromise intelligence  sources and methods.  \n \nOne of our best tools for impeding destabilizing  Iranian activities has been to identify  Iranian companies that \nare controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) or other Iranians on the list of Specially  \nDesignated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN  List) to non-U.S. businesses, so that they  can block assets \nor stop material transfers.  This process is labor-intensive and requires the judicious use of our national \nintelligence  assets.  Redirecting these assets to preparing this onerous public report would be  \ncounterproductive and will not reduce institutional corruption or promote transparency within Iran's system.   \n   \nIn addition, this bill's required public postings also may be perceived by  Iran and likely our Joint  \nComprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) partners as an attempt  to undermine the fulfilment of our  \ncommitments, in turn impacting the continued viability of this diplomatic arrangement that peacefully  and \nverifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  If the JCPOA  were to fail on that basis, it would \nremove  the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of \nthe international sanctions regime against  Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's \nleadership and our commitments to our closest  allies.  \n \nAs we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the \nAdministration remains clear-eyed regarding  Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, human \nrights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region.  The United States should retain all of the tools needed \nto counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to disrupt and interdict illicit  \nshipments of weapons and proliferation-sensitive technologies.  This bill would adversely affect the  U.S. \nGovernment's ability to wield these tools, would undermine the very  goals it purports to achieve, and could \neven endanger our ability to ensure that Iran's nuclear program is and remains exclusively peaceful.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5461, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.  \n \n* * * * * * *\n   ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n                                                                                                 March 21, 2016 \n                              (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2745 \u2013 Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Farenthold, R-TX, and five cosponsors)  \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2745, the Standard Merger and \nAcquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015, because it would eliminate the Federal \nTrade Commission's (FTC) ability to use critical administrative and procedural tools to promote \ncompetition and protect consumers. \n \nThe FTC plays an important role in advancing consumers' interests and promoting competition. \nFor over a century, the FTC has used its administrative process to challenge anticompetitive \nmergers and protect consumers.  H.R. 2745 would amend the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade \nCommission Act to prevent the FTC from using its administrative adjudication process to \nchallenge unconsummated mergers.  The bill also would require the FTC to seek certain \npreliminary injunctions under the Clayton Act as opposed to the FTC Act.  \n \nThe changes proposed in H.R. 2745 are unnecessary and threaten to undermine the FTC's \nimportant role in protecting competition and consumers.  The FTC's administrative adjudication \nprocess has proven to be valuable in advancing and clarifying antitrust law in complex cases.  \nFurthermore, the bill's provisions to eliminate the FTC's ability to use its administrative \nadjudications for unconsummated mergers are unwarranted.  While the process the FTC uses to \nchallenge mergers differs from DOJ's, there is no evidence that it affects outcomes or prejudices \nparties.  The FTC and DOJ share joint guidelines that set forth a common analytical framework \nfor reviewing mergers.

Wittman, R-VA, and 37 cosponsors) \n \nWhile the Administration strongly supports the goal of promoting recreational fishing, hunting, \nand shooting opportunities, and recognizes the economic and community benefits associated \nwith hunting and fishing, it strongly opposes H.R. 2406 in its current form.  These important \nrecreational opportunities abound on public lands are valued by millions of Americans who hunt \nand fish on public lands, forests, parks, and refuges.  Accordingly, the Administration supports \ncertain titles of H.R. 2406 that protect and further those opportunities, but opposes others which \ninclude harmful provisions that impair Federal management of federally-owned lands and \nundermine important existing public land and environmental laws, rules, and processes.  \n \nThe Administration supports Title II, which would amend funding requirements under current \nlaw for target range construction and maintenance, thus reducing the financial burden on State \nand local governments for public target ranges.  The Administration also supports \nreauthorization of the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, but has concerns about the use \nof funds from the Federal Land Disposal Account included in Title IX.  While the \nAdministration also supports Title XII, which would extend an important provision in the North \nAmerican Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA), this authority has already been extended \nthrough 2026 in P.L. 114-113, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2016.  \n \nHowever, the Administration strongly opposes Title VI, which would:  (1) exclude management \ndecisions from the National Environmental Policy Act, the cornerstone law guiding \nenvironmental protection and public involvement in Federal actions; (2) supersede longstanding \nstatutory planning discretion; and (3) undermine the Wilderness Act of 1964.  The \nAdministration also strongly opposes the following:  (1) Title I, which could prevent the Bureau \nof Land Management and Forest Service from limiting the use of lead shot or tackle where it is \nthreatening populations of native migratory birds and other wildlife, including on national \nwildlife refuges; (2) Title IV, which would prohibit the Secretary of the Army from \npromulgating or enforcing any regulations that would prohibit the possession of firearms at water \nresources development projects with limited exceptions; (3) Title VII, which would create \nconfusion regarding the enforcement of laws on baiting of migratory birds; (4) Title X, which \nwould interfere with the Administration's ongoing efforts to combat poaching and trafficked \nivory; (5) Title XIV, which would restrict the ability of the Secretaries of the Interior and \nCommerce to regulate certain recreational or commercial fishing access to certain waters; \n(6) Title XV, which would potentially create public safety issues by restricting the ability of the \nSecretary of Agriculture and Forest Service Chief to regulate certain hunting and fishing \nactivities within the National Forest System; and (7) Title XVI, which would disrupt an ongoing \nplanning effort for managing bison at Grand Canyon National Park and may cause confusion \nabout the National Park Service's existing authorities to manage wildlife populations.   \n  Furthermore, the Administration objects to Title VIII, which would prohibit the Director of the \nNational Park Service from promulgating or enforcing any regulation that prohibits an individual \nfrom transporting certain inoperable bows and crossbows across any unit of the National Park \nSystem.  Finally, the Administration has concerns with:  (1) Title V, which would abolish the \nWildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council and replace it with a council that is exempt \nfrom the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the framework and transparency that \nFACA ensures; and (2) Title XIII, which rescinds authority to manage certain commercial \nfilming activities on Federal lands and waterways managed by the Departments of the Interior \nand Agriculture.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to enact sportsmen \nand recreation legislation that addresses the concerns raised with certain provisions of H.R. 2406.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nNovember 17, 2015 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS.J.Res. 24 \u2013 Disapproving EPA Rule on Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for \nExisting Electric Utility Generating Units \n(Sen. Capito, R-WV, and 48 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes S.J.Res. 24, which would undermine the public health \nprotections of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and stop critical U.S. efforts to reduce dangerous carbon \npollution from power plants.  In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the CAA gives the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) \npollution.  In 2009, EPA determined that GHG pollution threatens Americans' health and welfare \nby leading to long-lasting changes to the climate that can, and are already, having a range of \nnegative effects on human health and the environment.  This finding is consistent with \nconclusions of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, and numerous other national and international scientific bodies.  Power plants account \nfor roughly one-third of all domestic GHG emissions.  While the United States limits dangerous \nemissions of arsenic, mercury, lead, particulate matter, and ozone precursor pollution from \npower plants, the Clean Power Plan and the Carbon Pollution Standards put into place the first \nnational limits on power plant carbon pollution.  The Clean Power Plan empowers States to cost-\neffectively reduce emissions from existing sources and provides States and power plants a great \ndeal of flexibility in meeting the requirements.  EPA expects that under the Clean Power Plan, by \n2030, carbon pollution from power plants will be reduced by 32 percent from 2005 levels.  \n \nBy nullifying the Clean Power Plan, S.J.Res. 24 seeks to block progress towards cleaner energy, \neliminating public health and other benefits of up to $54 billion per year by 2030, including \nthousands fewer premature deaths from air pollution and tens of thousands of fewer childhood \nasthma attacks each year.  Most importantly, the resolution would impede efforts to reduce \ncarbon pollution from existing power plants \u2013 the largest source of carbon pollution in the \ncountry \u2013 when the need to act, and to act quickly, to mitigate climate change impacts on \nAmerican communities has never been more clear.   \n  \nSince it was enacted in 1970, and amended in 1977 and 1990, each time with strong bipartisan \nsupport, the CAA has improved the Nation's air quality and protected public health.  Over that \nsame period of time, the economy has tripled in size while emissions of key pollutants have \ndecreased by more than 70 percent.  Forty-five years of clean air regulation have shown that a \nstrong economy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand. \n  \nBecause S.J.Res. 24 threatens the health and economic welfare of future generations by blocking \nimportant standards to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector that take a flexible, \ncommon sense approach to addressing carbon pollution, if the President were presented with \nS.J.Res. 24, he would veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n \n         June 14, 2016  \n         (Senate) \nS A P  \nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nS. 2837 \u2014 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2017 \n(Sen. Cochran, R-MS) \n \nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on S. 2837, making appropriations for \nthe Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year \n(FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes. \n \nThe Administration welcomes the bill's investments in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \nand in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's observational infrastructure, \nincluding funding for the next generation of polar orbiting satellites that are critical to providing \naccurate and timely weather forecasts.  In addition, the Administration appreciates the \nCommittee's support for investments that would increase the International Trade \nAdministration's trade enforcement and compliance efforts, which help ensure that U.S. \nbusinesses compete on a level playing field in the global economy.  The Administration also \nappreciates the Committee's support for investments in State and local assistance, and the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Commercial Crew program.  Finally, \nthe Administration is pleased that the bill supports the construction of a new consolidated FBI \nheadquarters facility to support the agency's national security and law enforcement missions. \n \nHowever, the bill's inadequate funding of research, testing, and implementation activity for the \n2020 Decennial Census would undermine the Census Bureau's efforts to reduce the costs of \nadministering the 2020 Decennial Census by more than $5 billion.  The bill also fails to provide \nthe funding necessary for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to \nhire the requested 200 additional agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws and \nkeep guns out of the wrong hands.  In addition, the Administration is deeply concerned that the \nbill adds more than $1 billion above the FY 2017 Budget request for NASA's Space Launch \nSystem (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule while underfunding other key NASA programs\u2014an \napproach that would result in an unbalanced exploration program that is unable to achieve shared \nexploration goals. \n \nThe Administration also urges the Congress to enact the mandatory research and development \n(R&D) funding requested in NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of \nCommerce to support the critical role that R&D plays in expanding the frontiers of human \nknowledge, tackling the Nation's biggest challenges, and driving the economy forward.  \n \nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated \nfor FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense \nspending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class \nfamilies, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration  looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that \nagreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  \nHowever, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological \nprovisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the final bill that is presented to \nthe President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Commerce \n \nCensus Bureau Periodic Censuses and Programs (including 2020 Decennial Census).  The \nAdministration objects to the inadequate funding provided for the Census Bureau's Periodic \nCensuses and Programs account.  The FY 2017 Budget proposed a robust funding level for the \nCensus Bureau to continue the research, testing, and implementation of new design changes that \nhave the potential to save more than $5 billion in the 2020 Decennial Census compared to \nrepeating previous methods.  The bill's funding level puts these design changes at risk, potentially \nincreasing the cost to the taxpayer for administering the 2020 Decennial Census or requiring \nunsustainable reductions in other critical surveys such as the American Community Survey, the \nEconomic Census, or the Census of Governments. \n \nNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) Funding and Coordination.  The \nAdministration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for manufacturing \ninstitutes and coordination.  The FY 2017 Budget request builds on the momentum of the first \nDepartment of Commerce-led manufacturing institute, which will launch later this year, by \nproviding the funding to launch two more institutes in FY 2017.  These institutes, which will be \npart of the NNMI, are designed to bridge the gap between basic research and product \ndevelopment to advance U.S. manufacturing capacity in critical technology areas.  These \ninstitutes have already demonstrated an ability to encourage investment and production in the \nUnited States, creating good jobs now and preparing American workers for future opportunities \nin the advanced manufacturing sector. \n \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Labs.  The Administration urges the \nCongress to support increased funding for high priority research initiatives at the NIST labs \nproposed in the FY 2017 Budget request.  These initiatives allow NIST to conduct the research \nnecessary to strengthen U.S. leadership in the industries of the future, such as advanced \ncommunications, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing.  The Administration notes \nthat the bill provided $24 million more than requested for lab construction and believes these \nfunds would be better directed to the new research initiatives proposed in the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest. \n \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee's support for NOAA's observational infrastructure, including high priority weather \nand next generation polar satellites, and urges the Congress also to support critical investments in \nclimate and oceans research.  These investments, such as Arctic observations, the Climate \nResilience Toolkit, and ocean acidification, provide information to help communities around the \nUnited States prepare for the effects of natural disasters and other ramifications of climate \nchange and provide the science necessary to inform their preparations. \n2   \nInternational Trade Administration (ITA).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the \nrequested funding level of $521 million, which would allow for the expansion of SelectUSA and \nITA's trade promotion operations both internationally and within the United States.  These \ninvestments support U.S. companies trying to compete in a global economy by opening up new \nmarkets and helping secure new overseas investment in U.S. businesses. \n \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) \n \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Headquarters Consolidation Project.  The Administration \nappreciates the Committee's strong support for the new consolidated FBI headquarters facility by \nproviding the FY 2017 Budget request of $646 million.  This funding\u2014together with prior year \nfunding and resources in the FY 2017 Budget requested for the General Services Administration's \nFederal Buildings Fund\u2014would allow the project to proceed in a timely manner.  The project will \nculminate in a modern headquarters facility that is tailored to fully support FBI's national security \nand law enforcement missions. \n \nFederal Law Enforcement.  While the Administration appreciates the funding provided for the \nFBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, the bill underfunds other law enforcement \ncomponents of DOJ.  The Administration is especially concerned with the Committee's funding \nlevel for ATF, which is insufficient to hire the requested 200 additional agents and investigators \nto help enforce existing gun laws and regulations designed to take violent criminals off the street, \ndeter other unlawful activity, and prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands. \n \nBureau of Prisons.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not fully fund the \nFY 2017 Budget request for the Bureau of Prisons to improve post-incarceration outcomes.  The \nAdministration seeks to expand mental health and substance abuse programs, provide additional \nvocational and educational opportunities, and to add community-based reentry programs.  These \nprograms are needed to reduce barriers to successful re-entry. \n \nCommunity Policing Initiative.  While the bill partially supports the Strengthening Police-\nCommunity Relations initiative, which includes elements of the Administration's Community \nPolicing Initiative (CPI) proposal, it falls short of the funding necessary to ensure the success of \ncentral components of the FY 2017 Budget request.  Improving community-police relations is \ncrucial to maintaining public safety and confidence in the criminal justice system.  The \nAdministration appreciates the $50 million the bill provides for CPI funding, including partial \nfunding of the request for Smart Policing, Body Worn Cameras (BWC), and the Collaborative \nReform Initiative.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 \nBudget request, which would expand the Building Community Trust and Justice Initiative, further \nincrease the use of BWCs, and enable the Office of Community Oriented Policing (COPS) to \npartner with more law enforcement agencies and cities that may need assistance on a wide variety \nof criminal justice issues. \n \nState and Local Grants.  The Administration appreciates the overall funding level provided for \ncriminal justice assistance.  The bill provides $2.3 billion for State and local grants, which is \napproximately $235 million above the FY 2017 Budget request.  The Administration urges the \nCongress to fully fund the request for the COPS Hiring program, which would support hiring for \nmore than 1,200 community policing officers nation-wide.  The Administration is also concerned \nwith the significant reduction to juvenile justice programs.  These programs help reduce juvenile \n3  delinquency and crime, protect public safety, hold offenders accountable, assist missing and \nexploited children and their families, and provide treatment and rehabilitative services tailored to \nthe needs of juveniles and their families. \n \nViolence Against Women.  The Administration appreciates the support for Violence Against \nWomen Act programs as well as the Community Teams to Reduce the Sexual Assault Evidence \nKit Backlog and Improve Sexual Assault Investigations Program.  However, the Administration \nurges the Congress to fully fund the request for the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies Program \nand the Legal Assistance Program in order to address critical needs in the fight to stop violence \nagainst women.  Investments in these programs would help to improve victim safety, save lives, \nand establish practices that can be sustained in the coming years. \n \nGeneral Legal Activities.  The Administration is concerned that the bill fails to provide any of the \nincreases requested in the FY 2017 Budget to enhance the efforts of legal divisions, including:  \nthe Civil Rights Division to improve police-community relations, protect the rights of \nservicemembers, and expand access for people with disabilities; the Environment and Natural \nResources Division to improve environmental protection in Indian Country and enhance the \nsafety of America's workforce; the Civil Division to enhance elder justice efforts and enforce \nimmigration laws; and INTERPOL Washington to keep pace with increasing requests for \ninternational law enforcement information sharing and coordination.  The bill provides \n$893 million for General Legal Activities, which is $64 million below the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest. \n \nGuantanamo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 527 and \n528 of the bill, which would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United \nStates and for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo \ndetainees in the United States.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these \nand similar provisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions.  \nOperating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens U.S. national security by draining \nresources, damaging U.S. relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent \nextremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive \nBranch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to \ndetermine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and \ncircumstances of each case and U.S. national security interests.  Moreover, section 527 would \nviolate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances. \n \nRestrictions on Combatting Unlawful Gun Trafficking.  The Administration strongly objects to \nnumerous provisions that would inhibit efforts to combat illegal gun activities, including unlawful \ntrafficking, particularly where there has been little or no meaningful engagement with ATF on the \nprovisions and their application.  These include restrictions preventing ATF from curtailing the \nimportation of \"curio or relic\" firearms or ammunition and denying applications to import \nshotguns that do not meet the statutory \"sporting purposes\" test.  The Administration also urges \nthe Congress to repeal a number of other unnecessarily restrictive provisions made permanent in \nprior years. \n \nLegal Services Corporation (LSC) \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the $475 million requested in the FY 2017 \nBudget for LSC, supporting grants for high-quality civil legal assistance to low-income \n4  Americans.  LSC grantees represent the working poor, veterans, homeowners and renters, \nfamilies with children, farmers, people with disabilities, and the elderly.  Women\u2014many of \nwhom are struggling to keep their children safe and their families together through restraining \norders and custody challenges\u2014comprise 70 percent of clients.  At the reduced level of $395 \nmillion provided in the bill, thousands of otherwise eligible low-income Americans would be \ndenied legal assistance, impacting their due process rights and fair treatment in the courts. \n \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \n \nFunding Balance.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's robust overall funding level \nfor NASA.  However, the Administration is deeply concerned that the bill adds more than \n$1 billion above the FY 2017 Budget request for the SLS rocket and Orion capsule while \nunderfunding other key NASA programs.  Continued congressional focus on these large-scale \ndevelopment programs at the expense of the technologies and capabilities needed to make space \nexploration affordable and future missions achievable would result in an unbalanced exploration \nprogram that is unable to achieve shared exploration goals. \n \nExploration R&D.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 \nBudget request for Exploration R&D, including funds to initiate a public/private partnership to \ncreate a deep space habitat and to proceed with the Asteroid Redirect Mission.  Underfunding the \nrequest would leave the SLS and Orion without missions and needed capabilities when their \ntesting is complete. \n \nSpace Technology.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest for NASA Space Technology.  Compared to the request, the bill reduces funding for these \ninvestments by $140 million, or 17 percent, and includes programmatic direction that further \nreduces the funding available for planned missions.  Impacts would likely include delaying \ndevelopment of a cutting-edge laser communication system, advanced, high power solar electric \npropulsion, and other space technology demonstrations, slowing progress on the journey to Mars, \nand reducing the international competitiveness of the U.S. commercial space industry. \n \nAeronautics.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request \nfor Aeronautics.  The bill's reduction of $190 million from the request would likely force NASA \nto abandon its new series of experimental aircraft intended to make aircraft faster, greener, and \nmore efficient and to ensure the U.S. aerospace industry's leadership. \n \nScience.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for \nNASA Science programs.  Compared to the request, the bill reduces funding by over \n$200 million, potentially delaying or cancelling space science missions in development, \nterminating operating missions, and reducing new funding for research grants.   \n \nSpace Operations.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest for NASA Space Operations, for which the bill provides $125.2 million below the request. \n \nNational Science Foundation (NSF) \n \nAgency Operations and Award Management.  The Administration is concerned that the bill \nunderfunds the required costs associated with the agency's plans to move its headquarters in \nFY 2017 and would therefore impact the agency's ability to carry out its mission. \n5   \nMajor Research Equipment and Facility Construction.  The Administration is concerned that the \nCommittee provided $53 million more than requested for the Major Research Equipment and \nFacility Construction account and believes these funds would be better directed to other NSF \ninitiatives. \n \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) \n \nTopline Funding.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill underinvests in EEOC by \nfreezing the agency at last year's funding level, which is $12 million below the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest, and urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request.  A freeze in funding \nwould result in EEOC's fourth year of essentially flat funding, which would compromise EEOC's \nability to target and remedy employment discrimination and ensure that individuals alleging \ndiscrimination have timely access to justice.  This level would impede EEOC's ability to reduce \nits private-sector charge backlog and leverage technology to increase efficiency and customer \nservice.  \n \nOther Issues \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 \nBudget request for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, and NSF to develop a \nU.S. Digital Service team.  This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the \ngreatest impact on citizens and businesses. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSeveral provisions in the bill, particularly sections 509 and 519, would raise constitutional \nconcerns in certain applications by intruding upon the President's constitutional authority over \ninternational diplomacy. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n6  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  September 12, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5620 \u2013 VA Accountability First and Appeals Modernization Act of 2016 \n(Rep. Miller, R-FL, and 29 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that the Nation's veterans have access to the care, \nservices, and benefits that they have earned.  Over the past seven years, the President has \nmaintained a steadfast commitment to serving veterans and their families.  More veterans are \nnow receiving health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) than ever before, \nand VA is delivering more benefits to more veterans in a timely and efficient manner.  The \nAdministration is working to end veteran homelessness in cities and states across the country, \nand has reduced veteran homelessness by nearly half.  Under the leadership of the First Lady and \nDr. Biden, through their Joining Forces initiative, the Administration has called on all Americans \nto rally around service members, veterans, and their families to support them through wellness, \neducation, and employment opportunities.  And Secretary McDonald has initiated the most \nsweeping organizational transformation in the history of VA, ensuring that the agency is keeping \nveterans' best interests at the center of everything it does. \n \nH.R. 5620 includes a provision that would enable another essential reform that would build on \nthis record of progress.  By fundamentally restructuring the current process by which veterans \ncan appeal their initial benefits claims decisions, this legislation would ensure that veterans \nreceive the benefits they have earned and are not subject to years of endless waiting and \nduplicative process.  The current appeals process \u2013 built up over 80 years of overlapping laws \nand regulations \u2013 is broken and is failing both veterans and taxpayers.  Today, more than \n450,000 appeals are pending at some point in the process, with veterans waiting an average of at \nleast 3 years for a decision.  Moreover, the problem is only going to get worse if the system is \nnot fundamentally reformed.  VA projects that, under the current process, the number of pending \nappeals will soar to more than 2.17 million by the end of 2027, which will require a significant \nincrease in resources to address and result in veterans continuing to wait for an appeals decision \nfor years. \n \nIn response to this critical problem, the Administration, with the support of major veteran \nadvocacy groups, put forward a comprehensive appeals reform proposal that would fix this \nsystem.  The essential feature of this new approach is to step away from a unified appeals \nprocess that tries to do many unrelated things inside a single process and replace that with \ndifferentiated lanes, which give veterans clear options after receiving an initial decision on a \nclaim.  And it would allow all veterans to have a clear answer and path forward on their appeal \nwithin one year from filing.  H.R. 5620 adopts this comprehensive reform proposal, and the \nAdministration strongly supports this provision.   \n \nHowever, the Administration is deeply concerned that H.R. 5620 contains numerous provisions \nthat would undermine VA's workforce and could ultimately hinder the ability of the over \n330,000 dedicated civil servants at VA to effectively serve veterans.  The Administration is  strongly committed to strict accountability standards that ensure VA employees act with the best \ninterests of veterans in mind, and instances of misconduct or poor performance in carrying out \nthese duties cannot be tolerated.  But the Administration believes that the approach to \naccountability in the legislation \u2013 focused primarily on firing or demoting employees without \nappropriate or meaningful procedural protections \u2013 is misguided and burdensome.  This \napproach significantly alters and diminishes important rights and protections that are available to \nthe vast majority of other employees across the government and which are essential to \nsafeguarding employees' rights and the merit system.  Furthermore, the legislation allows for the \nbroad recoupment of awards earned by VA employees, and prevents VA from rewarding its \nhigh-performing senior executives.  These provisions will make it more difficult for VA to \nattract the top talent that is needed to serve veterans, limit the rights of VA employees and senior \nexecutives, and set back the work done by VA to rebuild veterans' trust. \n \nIn addition, many of the provisions in the legislation raise constitutional concerns.  Most \nsignificantly, certain provisions compress the time period within which VA employees would \nreceive notice and an opportunity to be heard on charges against them before the Secretary of \nVA may take disciplinary action, including removal, and provide an expedited appeal process in \nwhich the disciplinary action would be automatically affirmed if the reviewing agency failed to \nrule within a certain number of days.  We would welcome the opportunity to work with the \nCongress to address these due process concerns and other potential constitutional concerns raised \nby the bill. \n \nThe Administration encourages the Congress to ensure that accountability actions support, rather \nthan impede, the ability of VA to carry out its duties, and looks forward to continuing to work \nwith the Congress to address these and other important issues on behalf of the Nation's veterans \nand their families.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMay 12, 2015 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2048 \u2013 USA FREEDOM Act  \n(Rep.

The Administration applauds and appreciates the strong bipartisan and \nbicameral effort that led to the formulation of this bill, which strikes an appropriate balance \nbetween significant reform and preservation of important national security tools.   \n \nThe bill strengthens the FISA's privacy and civil liberties protections, while preserving essential \nauthorities our intelligence and law enforcement professionals need to protect the Nation.  The \nbill would implement various reforms, including prohibiting bulk collection through the use of \nSection 215, FISA pen registers, and National Security Letters, while maintaining authorities to \nconduct more targeted collection.  It also enhances transparency by expanding the amount of \ninformation providers can disclose and requiring the government to increase its public reporting \nas well.   \n \nThe USA FREEDOM Act's significant reforms would provide the public greater trust and \nconfidence in our national security programs and the checks and balances that form an integral \npart of their operation.

McCaul, R-Texas, and Rep. Ratcliffe, R-Texas) \nAn important building block for improving the Nation's cybersecurity is ensuring that private \nentities can collaborate to share timely cyber threat information with each other and the Federal \nGovernment.  In January, the President submitted an updated legislative proposal to the \nCongress with the goal of, among other things, facilitating greater information sharing amongst \nthe private sector and with the Federal Government.  The Administration's proposal provides a \nfocused approach to facilitate more cybersecurity information sharing while ensuring the \nprotection of individuals' privacy and civil liberties.  As the Administration has previously \nstated, information sharing legislation must carefully safeguard privacy and civil liberties, \npreserve the long-standing respective roles and missions of civilian and intelligence agencies, \nand provide for appropriate sharing with targeted liability protections.  \nThe Administration commends the House Homeland Security Committee for its efforts to craft \ncybersecurity information sharing legislation with strong privacy protections.  While the \nAdministration supports House passage of H.R. 1731, improvements to the bill are needed to \nensure that its liability protections are appropriately targeted to encourage responsible \ncybersecurity practices.  The Administration recognizes the importance of the House and Senate \nworking together to achieve these shared goals and supports advancing this legislation so that \nimprovements can be made as the legislative process continues. \nWhile the bill has improved significantly, the Administration still has concerns with H.R. 1731's \nsweeping liability protections.  Appropriate liability protections should incentivize good \ncybersecurity practices and should not grant immunity to a private company for failing to act on \ninformation it receives about the security of its networks.  Such a provision would remove \nincentives for companies to protect their customers' personal information and may weaken \ncybersecurity writ large.  The Administration believes that a reasonable solution that strikes an \nappropriate balance can be found.  \nThe Administration appreciates that the bill preserves the long-standing, respective roles and \nmissions of civilian and intelligence agencies.  Similar to the Administration's proposal, H.R. \n1731 authorizes cybersecurity information sharing with a civilian agency, specifically the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration \nCenter.  This approach will help protect privacy and provide appropriate transparency.  In \naddition, charging one agency with facilitating the near real-time exchange of cyber threat \nindicators will enhance the efficacy of information sharing efforts and is more effective from an \noperational standpoint. \nCybersecurity requires a whole-of-government approach, including the ability to share relevant \ncybersecurity information quickly amongst relevant agencies.  Once information is shared with \nthe Federal Government, it should be shared with appropriate agencies in as close to real-time \nas  possible so that the Federal Government can use the information to better defend the Nation's\nnetworks.  This sharing must be governed by certain narrow use limitations \u2013 an essential part of \noverlapping privacy and civil liberties protections that also rely on transparent oversight.  The \nAdministration would seek to clarify that information shared with the Federal Government can\nbe used for investigating, prosecuting, disrupting, or otherwise responding to appropriate crimes. \nH.R. 1731 also authorizes the use of certain potentially disruptive defensive measures in \nresponse to network incidents, provisions that were not included in the Administration's \nproposal.  The use of defensive measures without appropriate safeguards raises significant legal, \npolicy, and diplomatic concerns and can have a direct deleterious impact on information systems \nand undermine cybersecurity.  Moreover, as drafted, these provisions may prevent the \napplication of other laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and State common law tort \nremedies.  Though the Administration remains concerned that the bill's authorization to operate \ndefensive measures is not adequately tailored, it is committed to working with stakeholders to \naddress its remaining concerns. \nInformation sharing is one piece of a larger suite of legislation needed to provide the private \nsector, the Federal Government, and law enforcement with the necessary tools to combat \ncyber threats.  In addition to updating information sharing statutes, the Congress should \nincorporate privacy and civil liberties safeguards into all aspects of cybersecurity and enact \nlegislation that creates a strong and consistent notification standard for breaches of personal \ndata, as well as legislation that gives law enforcement the tools to fight cybercrime in the \ndigital age.  \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n) \n  July 21, 2015 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1734 \u2013 Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act of 2015 \n(Rep. McKinley, R-WV, and 44 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1734, because it would undermine the protection of \npublic health and the environment provided by the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s) \nDecember 2014 final rule addressing the risks posed by mismanaged impoundments of coal ash \nand other coal combustion residuals (CCR).  The 2008 failure of a coal ash impoundment in \nKingston, Tennessee, and the 2014 coal ash spill into the Dan River in Eden, North Carolina, \nserve as stark reminders of the need for safe disposal and management of coal ash. \n \nEPA\u2019s rule articulates clear and consistent national standards to protect public health and the \nenvironment, prevent contamination of drinking water, and minimize the risk of catastrophic \nfailure at coal ash surface impoundments.  H.R. 1734 would, however, substantially weaken \nthese protections.  For example, the bill would eliminate restrictions on how close coal ash \nimpoundments can be located to drinking water sources.  It also would undermine EPA\u2019s \nrequirement that unlined impoundments must close or be retrofitted with protective liners if they \nare leaking and contaminating drinking water.  Further, the bill would delay requirements in \nEPA\u2019s final CCR rule, including structural integrity and closure requirements, for which tailored \nextensions are already available through EPA\u2019s rule and through approved Solid Waste \nManagement Plans. \n \nWhile the Administration supports appropriate State program flexibility, H.R. 1734 would allow \nStates to modify or waive critical protective requirements found in EPA\u2019s final CCR rule.  \nSpecifically, H.R. 1734 authorizes States to implement permit programs that would not meet a \nnational minimum standard of protection and fails to provide EPA with an opportunity to review \nand approve State permit programs prior to implementation, departing from the long-standing \nprecedent of previously enacted Federal environmental statutes.   \n \nBecause it would undercut important national protections provided by EPA\u2019s 2014 CCR \nmanagement and disposal rule, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1734.

Hurt, R-VA, and five cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5424.  Actions taken in the years since enactment of \nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act are curbing excessive risk-\ntaking, closing regulatory gaps, and making our financial system safer and more resilient.  For \nthe first time, advisers to private funds with more than $150 million in assets are required to \nregister with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); comply with new recordkeeping, \nreporting, and audit requirements; and file systemic risk reports.  The President has been clear \nabout his opposition to any legislation that would weaken or reduce oversight of the financial \nsystem.   \n \nSpecifically, H.R. 5424 would create a loophole providing a broad exemption from audit and \nexam requirements, leaving investors unable to verify that funds actually contain particular \ninvestments as claimed.  The bill would also make it more difficult for the SEC to police the \nmarket, particularly with respect to investments in uncertificated, private securities for which \nadvisers would not be required to keep any record.  Further, H.R. 5424 would repeal important \nsafeguards, including the requirements that advisers: notify clients of a change in ownership or \ncontrol of the adviser, deliver a plain language narrative brochure to clients annually, and \ndisclose certain information on large private equity funds to regulators.  \n \nThe exemptions that this bill provides would enable private fund advisers to slip back into the \nshadows.  H.R. 5424 unnecessarily puts working and middle-class families at risk while \nbenefitting Wall Street and other narrow special interests.  Considering that investors in private \nequity funds include public pension funds \u2013 which support our Nation's teachers, police officers \nand firefighters \u2013 the Congress should be encouraging the SEC to fully implement the enhanced \ninvestor safeguards provided in current law, not repealing important protections.  Therefore, the \nAdministration strongly opposes H.R. 5424 and urges the Congress to act responsibly by \nenacting laws that enhance protections for investors and help working and middle-class families. \n \nIf the President were presented with this legislation, his senior advisors would recommend he \nveto the bill.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n) \n                    July 23, 2015 \n                    (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY  \nH. R. 3009 \u2013 Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act \n(Rep. Hunter, R-CA, and 44 cosponsors) \n  \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3009.  This bill fails to offer comprehensive reforms \nneeded to fix the Nation's broken immigration laws, undermines current Administration efforts to \nremove the most dangerous convicted criminals and to work collaboratively with State and local \nlaw enforcement agencies, and threatens the civil rights of all Americans by authorizing State \nand local officials to collect information regarding any private citizen's immigration status, at \nany time, for any reason, and without justification. \n \nThe Administration continues to believe that it is critical to fix the Nation's broken immigration \nsystem through comprehensive commonsense legislation that builds on existing efforts to \nstrengthen border security, cracks down on employers hiring undocumented workers, streamlines \nlegal immigration, and offers an earned path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to get \nright with the law if they pass background checks, contribute to the Nation's economy by paying \ntaxes, and go to the back of the line.  While the Senate passed comprehensive legislation with \nstrong bipartisan support over two years ago that would do just that, the House of \nRepresentatives failed to take any action.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, that \nlegislation would also grow the Nation's economy by 5.4 percent and reduce Federal deficits by \nnearly $850 billion over 20 years.  The Administration continues to urge the Congress to address \nall of the problems with the Nation's broken immigration system and take up commonsense \nlegislation that will offer meaningful solutions to those problems. \n \nThe Administration also believes the most effective way to enhance public safety is through \nsensible and effective policies that focus enforcement resources on the most significant public \nsafety threats.  The Administration has put in place new enforcement priorities that do just that, \nfocusing limited resources on the worst offenders \u2013 national security threats, convicted criminals, \ngang members, and recent border crossers.  The effectiveness of these new priorities depends on \ncollaboration between Federal, State, and local law enforcement.  Every day, the Federal \ngovernment fosters State and local collaboration through a variety of mechanisms, including \npolicies, programs, and joint task forces.  The Department of Homeland Security's Priority \nEnforcement Program (PEP) enables Federal immigration enforcement to work with State and \nlocal law enforcement to take custody of individuals who are enforcement priorities, including \npublic safety and national security threats, before those individuals are released into \ncommunities.  PEP is a balanced, commonsense approach to enforcing the Nation's immigration \nlaws.  It replaced the Secure Communities program, which, by establishing a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d \napproach to State and local cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement officials, \ndiscouraged some localities from turning over dangerous individuals to DHS custody.  Secure \nCommunities was embroiled in litigation and widely criticized for undermining State and local \ncommunity policing efforts.  PEP builds collaboration between Federal, State, and local law  enforcement that allows for the most effective enforcement while enhancing community policing \nand trust.  The Congress should give PEP a chance to work, instead of displacing that \ncollaborative approach\u2014which prioritizes the worst offenders\u2014with the coercive approach of \nthis bill, which makes no such differentiation. \n \nFinally, the bill would condition Federal money on State and local governments allowing their \nlaw enforcement officials to gather citizenship and immigration status information from any \nperson at any time for any reason.  The Administration believes that such blanket authority \nwould threaten the civil rights of all Americans, lead to mistrust between communities and State \nand local law enforcement agencies, and impede efforts to safely, fairly, and effectively enforce \nthe Nation's immigration laws.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3009, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto this bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nNovember 17, 2015 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 511 \u2013 Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Rokita, R-IN, and 54 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is deeply committed to respecting tribal sovereignty and maintaining \ngovernment-to-government relationships with Indian tribes as well as to protecting American \nworkers and enforcing Federal labor laws.  The Administration cannot support H.R. 511, the \nTribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015, as currently drafted, because it does not include the \nprovisions as explained below. \n \nThe President's commitment to tribal sovereignty has taken many forms\u2014from establishing the \nWhite House Council on Native American Affairs, to reaffirming tribal authority to prosecute \nnon-Indians under the Violence Against Women Act, and to promoting tribal self-determination \nby signing into law the Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Homeownership \n(HEARTH) Act so that tribes may lease their lands without the approval of the Secretary of the \nInterior.  \n \nAt the same time, the President is firmly dedicated to protecting American workers.  The \nAdministration vigorously enforces Federal labor laws and has repeatedly emphasized the \nimportance of strengthening workers' rights to collective bargaining.  \n \nThe Administration is encouraged by the efforts of some tribal governments to balance these \nimportant interests and find common ground when formulating compacts to operate casinos on \ntribal land under the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  In several of these compacts, tribes \nhave agreed to establish their own labor relations policies.  Though these compacts differ on \nminor details, what they have in common is that they generally protect tribal self-governance \nwhile also ensuring that most casino workers retain important and effective labor rights. \n \nIt is thus possible to protect both tribal sovereignty and workers' rights, and the Administration \ncan only support approaches that accomplish that result.  Therefore, the Administration can \nsupport a bill which recognizes tribal sovereignty in formulating labor relations law and exempts \ntribes from the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board only if the tribes adopt labor \nstandards and procedures applicable to tribally-owned and operated commercial enterprises \nreasonably equivalent to those in the National Labor Relations Act.  Amended legislation would \nalso need to include an authorization for funding to support the development and implementation \nof tribal labor laws and regulations. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  May 23, 2016 \n   (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5055 \u2014 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2017 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5055, making appropriations for \nenergy and water development, and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September \n30, 2017, and for other purposes. \n \nWhile the bill increases certain energy research and development activities, it underfunds critical \nenergy research and development activities overall. The bill does not put the Nation on a \nsufficiently ambitious path toward doubling clean energy research and development by FY 2021. \nSpecifically, H.R. 5055 underfunds the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and Energy \nEfficiency and Renewable Energy programs, with levels significantly below the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest, which would undermine critical activities that support the development and \ncommercialization of clean energy technologies.  At this funding level, the number of research, \ndevelopment, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, \nand the national labs would be reduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement.  The \nbill also eliminates funding for important restoration efforts by the Bureau of Reclamation on the \nSan Joaquin River, which would undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's goals \nto restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts as well as \nefforts to help address long-term water challenges in the drought-sensitive San Joaquin region.  \nFurthermore, the legislation includes highly problematic ideological provisions, including \nprovisions that threaten to undermine our ability to protect a resource that is essential to \nAmerica's health:  clean water. \n \nDespite these shortcomings, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in improving \nresilience against current and ongoing climate impacts that threaten the economy, public health, \nand natural resources.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee's strong support for \nthe National Nuclear Security Administration's Weapons Activities, Defense Nuclear \nNonproliferation, and Naval Reactors programs. \n \nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated \nfor FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense \nspending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class \nfamilies, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that \nagreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  \nHowever, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological \nprovisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the President were  presented with \nH.R. 5055, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) \n \nMission Innovation.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for certain \nincreases in clean energy RD&D investment, including for the Advanced Research Projects \nAgency-Energy (ARPA-E). These increases are directionally consistent with Mission \nInnovation, helping move clean energy RD&D forward. Despite these gains however, the bill \nunderfunds critical energy research and development activities overall, and does not put us on a \nsufficiently ambitious path toward doubling clean energy research and development by FY 2021. \nThe bill underfunds investment in our students, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs; our \nbusinesses and universities; and our future economy.  This would slow the pace of progress on \nbreakthroughs in energy efficiency and clean energy; undermine America's long-standing \nnonpartisan support for pioneering research that seeks solutions to pressing problems; and hinder \nour ability to harness the power of new ideas and innovation to drive sustained economic growth \nin the clean energy economy of the future.  \n \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration objects to the  \n$306 million provided in the bill for ARPA-E, which, while an increase relative to enacted \nlevels, is a reduction of $44 million or 14 percent from the discretionary request for ARPA-E in \nthe FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduction would hinder the ability to invest in \ntransformational technologies that reduce energy-related emissions, increase energy efficiency \nacross multiple economic sectors, and reduce energy imports.    \n \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  The Administration strongly objects \nto the $1.8 billion provided in the bill for EERE.  Overall, this level is $1.1 billion below the \nFY 2017 Budget request.  Relative to the FY 2017 Budget request, the bill reduces funding for \nrenewable energy by 36 percent, sustainable transportation by 37 percent, and energy efficiency \nby 30 percent.  These reductions would significantly underfund critical activities that support the \ndevelopment and commercialization of clean energy technologies including wind energy, electric \nand other advanced vehicles, and building technologies.  At this funding level, the number of \nresearch, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, \nuniversities, and the national labs would be reduced or cancelled, limiting innovation and \ntechnological advancement.  Funding at this level also would impede the development of \nsolutions to reduce U.S. dependency on oil and reduce energy waste, and undermines the \nNation's competitiveness in the future global clean energy economy.  The Administration urges \nthe Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request of $2.9 billion.   \n \nOffice of Science.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Office \nof Science and the funding level of $5.4 billion provided in the bill, this is $172 million below \nthe FY 2017 Budget request and would significantly impact basic research and development \n(R&D) programs, most critically in Foundational Genomics Research and Bioenergy Research \nCenters within Biological and Environmental Research.  \n \nElectricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund \nimportant grid modernization activities at the FY 2017 Budget request level of $262 million \ninstead of the $225 million provided in the bill.  This funding supports important grid \n2  modernization activities including State Distribution Level Reform and State Energy Assurance \nwhich respond to Quadrennial Energy Review recommendations.  \n \nYucca Mountain.  The Administration objects to the funding provided in the bill for Yucca \nMountain and is disappointed with the rejection of the strategy proposed in the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest on nuclear waste.  The strategy incorporates important and practical solutions for a \nsuccessful waste program, such as consent-based siting, interim storage of waste, and program \nfunding reforms that are essential to the success of a Nuclear Waste Program.   \n \nFossil Energy Research and Development.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide \nadequate funding for clean energy priorities by using or reallocating $240 million in balances \nwithin the Fossil Energy R&D account identified in the FY 2017 Budget request as unnecessary \nfor Fossil Energy R&D activities.  \n \nEnergy Security and Infrastructure Modernization Fund.  The Administration urges the Congress \nto fund the Energy Security and Infrastructure Modernization Fund, as proposed in the FY 2017 \nBudget request.  Modernization of Strategic Petroleum Reserve infrastructure is necessary to \nensure the operational readiness of the Reserve.  \n \nEnergy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund \nthe FY 2017 Budget request of $131 million for EIA to completely fund investments in adding \nregional detail to petroleum data, enhancing commercial building energy efficiency data, and \nexpanding international analysis.  \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration \nappreciates that the Committee provided full funding for DOE to implement the DATA Act \nwithin the Departmental Administration account.  This funding supports efforts to provide more \ntransparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing \nbusiness processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.   \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided \nsufficient flexibility to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOE to develop a U.S. Digital \nService team.  This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest \nimpact on citizens and businesses.   \n \nDepartmental Administration.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Office of \nIndian Energy as a separate budget account.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \nincreased funding for this office, especially for important project oversight efforts.  However, \nfunding the Office of Indian Energy within the Departmental Administration account without \nadditional resources has reduced available funding for other management and program support \nfunctions which may significantly hinder DOE's ability to effectively and efficiently implement \nother priority management objectives.   \n \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) \n \nNonproliferation Construction.  The Administration strongly objects to continued construction of \nthe Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility.  It would be irresponsible for the Congress to \nrequire continued construction of this project.  The alternative disposition method is expected to \nbe significantly faster and less expensive than the wasteful approach the bill would mandate.  \n3  Continuing to require construction would waste limited national security funds and force more \npressing nuclear security needs to go unmet.  A recent independent study mandated by the \nFY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act indicates that even at a higher level of funding \n($375 million annually) it would take another century (program completion date of 2115) and \ninvolve lifecycle costs of over $100 billion to complete the plutonium disposition effort using \nMOX.  Alternative disposition would free up funds for other national security priorities, dispose \nof the excess plutonium safely and effectively, and meet international obligations decades \nsooner.  \n \nUnrequested NNSA Rescissions.  The Administration objects to section 308 of the bill which, in \ncombination with other rescissions in the bill, would rescind more than twice the amount \nproposed in the FY 2017 Budget request.  A rescission of this size would come at the expense of \nvital nuclear modernization and nonproliferation programs.   \n \nCorps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works (Corps) \n \nOverall Funding.  The bill funds the Corps civil works program at a net level of nearly  \n$6.1 billion.  The Administration appreciates the bill's investments in helping communities \nreduce the risk of floods, improving commercial navigation, and the Corps' efforts to restore the \nNation's aquatic ecosystems requested in the FY 2017 Budget.  However, the Administration \nbelieves funding included in the bill for the Corps beyond the FY 2017 Budget request would not \nprovide a high return on investment to the American taxpayer.   \n \nEcosystem Restoration.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for ecosystem \nrestoration activities, such as Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration, Columbia River \nFish Mitigation, South Florida Ecosystem Restoration, and Missouri River Fish and Wildlife \nRecovery, at the levels provided in the FY 2017 Budget request.   \n \nTechnical Assistance.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee's support for funding \nongoing efforts that provide local communities with technical and planning assistance to enable \nthem to reduce their flood risk, including nonstructural approaches. \n \nClean Water Act (CWA).  The Administration believes that the CWA provisions in the bill \nundermine efforts to protect America's clean water resources, which are critical to American \nfamilies and businesses.  The Administration strongly objects to section 110 of the bill in \nparticular, which would disrupt the Administration's current efforts to clarify the scope of the \nCWA, hamstring future regulatory efforts, and create significant ambiguity regarding existing \nregulations and guidance.   \n \nCWA Recapture.  The Administration strongly opposes section 109 of the bill, aimed at \npreventing the Corps from using the funds provided to require a CWA permit for pollutant \ndischarges that impair or destroy wetlands and other waters.  Section 109 would overturn nearly \n40 years of CWA implementation that exempts from permitting farming practices in the Nation's \nwetlands and eliminates regulatory burdens for farmers while protecting the Nation's water \nresources.  Section 109 is inconsistent with administration efforts to provide farmers and \nranchers with greater certainty and predictability under the CWA, reduce regulatory burdens, and \nprotect human health and the environment.  This is particularly troublesome for discharges that \nconvert areas of navigable waters into new uses where the flow or circulation of navigable \nwaters may be impaired or the reach of those waters may be reduced. \n4   \nFirearms Policy.  The Administration objects to section 111 of the bill, which prohibits the \nCorps from enforcing bans on firearms at water resources development projects.  If enacted, this \nprovision would prevent the Secretary of the Army from using the discretion now provided in \nlaw to enforce or revise the current Corps policy, based on considerations such as the security of \ncritical infrastructure, public and employee safety, and the manner in which the firearm is carried \n(e.g., open vs. concealed).  Corps rangers are not authorized to carry firearms and do not have \nfull Federal law enforcement authority.   \n \nNational Ocean Policy.  The Administration objects to section 506 of the bill, which prohibits \nfunding provided in the bill from being used to implement the coastal and marine spatial \nplanning and ecosystem-based management components of the National Ocean Policy.  This \nprovision would prohibit DOE and the Corps from participating in marine and coastal planning \nefforts that would improve stewardship of the Nation's oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.   \n \nDam Removal. The Administration objects to section 507 of the bill, which prohibits funding \nprovided in the bill from being used for the removal of any federally owned or operated dam.  \nWhile dams can provide numerous benefits to local communities, collaboratively developed \nstrategies to remove obsolete or unnecessary dams can be important components of broader \nefforts to reduce public safety risks, improve the health of our rivers, and support our local \neconomies. \n \nNationwide Flood Study.  The Administration urges the House to restore the $1 million requested \nin the FY 2017 Budget for the ongoing Water Resources Priorities study, which has the potential \nto help save lives and billions of dollars.  This study addresses a critical need to develop a \nbaseline assessment of flood risks at a national and regional scale; evaluate the overall \neffectiveness of current approaches; and develop recommendations to reduce flood damages, loss \nof life, and recovery costs, in ways that would also promote the long-term resilience of \ncommunities and ecosystems.   \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the \nFY 2017 Budget request for the Corps to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding \nsupports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and \nbusinesses.   \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, Yucca Mountain.  The Administration objects to the funding \nprovided in the bill for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue adjudication of the \nYucca Mountain license application.  \n \nPOWER+ Plan.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided $50 million to the \nAppalachian Regional Commission for the POWER+ Plan, fully funding the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest.  The funding would help create jobs, attract capital investments, and strengthen \nworkforce development for communities and workers that have been negatively affected by job \nlosses in coal mining, coal power plant operations, and coal-related supply chain industries due \nto the changing economics of America's energy production.  \n \n \n5  Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project \n \nOverall Funding.  The bill provides $1.1 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and $11 million \nfor the Central Utah Project Completion Act.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \nsupport for priorities within the Bureau of Reclamation's program, as reflected in the FY 2017 \nBudget request, including Indian Water Rights settlements, and the WaterSMART program.   \n \nSan Joaquin River Restoration.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's \nelimination of funding for this program, which would undermine the San Joaquin River \nRestoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water \nsupply impacts.  This restoration program is a multi-year effort that is integral to the \nimplementation of Federal legislation that settled 18 years of litigation.  The Congress has \nprovided funding each year since authorizing, and the Administration urges the Congress to \nprovide FY 2017 funding for this Administration priority at the level requested.   \n \nCalifornia Water.  The Administration strongly opposes sections 204 through 208 of the bill, \nwhich include several highly problematic provisions that undercut the Endangered Species Act \nand limit application of court-approved biological opinions, thereby resulting in detrimental \nconditions for Federal- and State-listed endangered species.  Furthermore, these provisions \npreempt California water law, fail to address critical elements of California's complex water \nchallenges and would, if enacted, impede an effective and timely response to the continuing \ndrought while providing no additional water to hard hit communities.  These provisions could \nactually slow decision-making, generate significant litigation, and limit real-time operational \nflexibility critical to maximizing water delivery.  As the Administration has stated in the past, \nthese provisions were developed with little input from the public, the Administration, or key \nstakeholders affected by the drought.  The urgency and seriousness of the California drought \nrequires a balanced and flexible approach that promotes water reliability and ecosystem \nrestoration.   \n \nAuthorizations for Continued Operations.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill did \nnot include the language requested in the FY 2017 Budget to increase the appropriations ceiling \nfor the Secure Water Act and to extend the California Bay-Delta Restoration authorization.  \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSection 201 of the bill raises separation of powers concerns. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n6  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n                                                                                                 December 2, 2015 \n                              (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n  \nSenate Amendment to H.R. 3762 \u2013 Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom \nReconciliation Act of 2015 \n(Sen. McConnell, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of the Senate amendment to \nH.R. 3762.  By repealing numerous, key elements of current law, this legislation would take \naway critical benefits and health care coverage from hard-working middle-class families.  The \nbill also would remove policies that are expected to help slow the growth in health care costs \nand that have improved the quality of care patients receive.  The Senate amendment to \nH.R. 3762 detracts from the work the Congress could be doing to foster job creation and \neconomic growth.  \n \nThe Affordable Care Act is working and is fully integrated into an improved American health \ncare system.  Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is a thing of the past.  And \nunder the law, health care prices have grown at the slowest rate in 50 years, benefiting all \nAmericans.  \n \nRepealing key elements of the Affordable Care Act would result in millions of individuals \nremaining uninsured or losing the insurance they have today.  An estimated 17.6 million \nAmericans gained coverage as several of the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions have \ntaken effect \u2013 15.3 million since the beginning of the first open enrollment in \nOctober 2013.  The Senate amendment to H.R. 3762 would roll back coverage gains and \nwould cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health \ncoverage they deserve.   \n \nRepealing the health care law would have implications far beyond these Americans who have \nor will gain insurance.  More than 150 million Americans with employer-based insurance \nwould be at risk of higher premiums and lower wages, or losing their coverage altogether.  It \nwould raise taxes on certain middle-class families.  The Senate amendment to H.R. 3762 also \nwould defund the Prevention and Public Health Fund, limit women's health care choices, and \ndisproportionately impact low-income individuals. \n \nThis legislation is being considered by the Senate just days ahead of the December 15 \ndeadline for Marketplace coverage that starts on January 1, 2016. Rather than refighting old \npolitical battles by once again voting to repeal basic protections that provide security for the \nmiddle class, Members of Congress should be working together to grow the economy, \nstrengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3762, as amended by the Senate amendment, he \nwould veto the bill. \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n                                                                                                                        July 8, 2015 \n                                                                                                                        (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 6 \u2013 21st Century Cures Act  \n(Rep. Upton, R-MI, and 230 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the bipartisan support for medical research in H.R. 6, the \n21st Century Cures Act, and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on strategies \nto prevent and cure disease and improve health.   \n \nIn particular, the Administration appreciates the legislation\u2019s support for the President\u2019s \nPrecision Medicine Initiative, which would advance a new model of participant-centered \nresearch to accelerate biomedical discoveries and provide clinicians with new tools and therapies \ntailored to individual patients\u2019 needs.  This will also require enabling patients to access their data \nand accelerating interoperability between electronic health records.  The Administration also \nbelieves we can build on our progress in improving the drug development and approval process \nby incorporating patients\u2019 voices into the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) decision-\nmaking; encouraging the development and qualification of reliable biomarkers to accelerate \nwork on important new therapies; and reducing barriers to initiating medical device trials.  \nH.R. 6 takes meaningful steps on each of these important issues and includes provisions to pay \nfor the new funding included in the bill. \n \nWhile the Administration welcomes the additional support for biomedical research and \ninnovation included in H.R. 6, the Administration has concerns about providing additional \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and FDA without addressing sequestration \nmore broadly.  Sequestration funding levels threaten not only NIH research, but also other \ninvestments in innovation.  They threaten health care access and quality, not only by \nunderfunding biomedical research, but also by underfunding key public health and mental health \nprograms.  The President has proposed a plan to reverse sequestration and increase funding for \nNIH by $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2016 while making other pro-growth investments.  Separately, \nthe new responsibilities for FDA outlined in H.R. 6 exceed the resources provided in the bill and \nthe President\u2019s FY 2016 Budget and as such, FDA will be unable to fully implement the \nprograms established in the bill, while maintaining its current performance levels.   \nH.R. 6 also proposes to sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a source of funding.  The \nAdministration reiterates the critical importance of making the investments necessary to \nmodernize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and ensure it continues to support U.S. energy \nsecurity.  The Administration remains concerned about extending drug exclusivity beyond \ncurrent law and how this provision will affect drug costs.  The Administration is also concerned \nthat this bill would make funding subject to problematic ideological riders included in \nappropriations bills.  The Administration believes funding should be free of such riders.  The \nAdministration also believes that H.R. 6 could undermine regulatory standards by allowing \nunproven uses of therapies to be marketed to health care payors as though such uses had been \nproven safe and effective.     \nFurther, while the Administration supports strengthening the Government\u2019s ability to hire and \nretain qualified scientific experts, we look forward to working with the Congress to do this while \npromoting accountability.  Finally, the Administration appreciates the bipartisan interest in \nadvancing the interoperability of health information technology and remains focused on the need \nto strengthen this critical foundation for delivery system reform and precision medicine.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on continuing to improve the \nbill as it moves forward.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n                    October 20, 2015 \n                    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 692 \u2013 Default Prevention Act \n(Rep. McClintock, R-CA, and 112 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 692, which would result in the Congress not paying \nobligations it has already agreed to, thereby putting the Nation into default on its obligations.  \nAny legislative proposal to prioritize certain payments over others is default by another name \nand would not protect the full faith and credit of the United States government or avoid the \nnegative impact of default on American jobs and businesses.  Such an approach would be the \nequivalent of a family saying that it will choose to pay its mortgage, but not its car payment, \ncredit card, or student loans, and expecting that its creditworthiness will not suffer.  It would \ncause the Nation to default on payments for Medicare, veterans, national security, and many \nother key priorities.  Making some payments while not making others would be unacceptably \nrisky and unfair to the American people.  \n \nUnder the President\u2019s leadership, annual deficits have come down by roughly three-quarters as a \nshare of the economy since 2009, the fastest period of sustained deficit reduction since just after \nWorld War II.  In Fiscal Year 2015, the deficit fell by $44 billion to just 2.5 percent of GDP\u2014a \nlevel significantly below the roughly 3-percent level needed to stabilize our debt-to-GDP ratio.  \nThe President has put forward a balanced approach to deficit reduction in his FY 2016 Budget \nthat would continue to stabilize the Nation's debt as a share of the economy, without \nshortchanging the kinds of investments that are critical to long-term economic growth.   \n \nThe President continues to work to find areas of compromise and common ground with both \nparties in the Congress.  But the President has been clear that he will not negotiate about whether \nto uphold the full faith and credit of the United States.  The Congress must pay the bills it has \nalready incurred; failure to do so would cause the Nation to default on our obligations for the \nfirst time in history.  \n \nThe President will not tolerate political gamesmanship, which caused the Nation\u2019s credit rating \nto be downgraded in 2011 and proved harmful to both the United States and global economy.  \nFor this reason, if the President is presented with legislation that would result in the Congress \nchoosing to default on our obligations and imperil the full faith and credit of the United States, \nhe would veto it. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nApril 27, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.J.Res. 88 \u2013 Disapproval of Department of Labor Rule on \nFiduciary Responsibility of Financial Advisers  \n(Rep.

Smith, R-Texas, and 10 cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES \nReauthorization Act of 2015, which would undermine critical investments in science, \ntechnology, and research.  The Administration believes that H.R. 1806 would be damaging to the \nAdministration's actions to move American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth forward \nthrough a world-leading science, technology, and innovation enterprise. \nThe Administration strongly opposes the bill's appropriation authorizations for the Department of \nEnergy (DOE), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology (NIST), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) that would \nestablish maximum funding levels significantly below those provided in the President's FY 2016 \nBudget.  For example, H.R. 1806 would weaken investments in critical clean energy research \nand development and grid modernization by providing authorization levels at less than half of the \nfunding levels proposed in the President's Budget for DOE's Advanced Research Projects \nAgency-Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and Office of Electricity \nDelivery and Energy Reliability.  Additionally, the legislation would shortchange efforts to \nsupport fundamental research to address diverse and critical global challenges by providing an \nauthorization level for the DOE Office of Science biological and environmental research \nprogram far short of the funding levels proposed in the President's Budget.  The America \nCOMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 would also establish NSF authorizations levels for \ngeosciences, education and human resources, international and integrative activities, and \nadministrative activities well below the funding levels proposed in the President's Budget, as \nwell as an NSF authorization for social, behavioral, and economic sciences research that is 58 \npercent below the President's Budget.  Additionally, the legislation would undermine efforts to \nimplement sound science and technology policies by providing an authorization level for OSTP \nnearly 20 percent below the President's Budget. \n \nIn addition to its strong opposition to the authorized funding levels in H.R. 1806, the \nAdministration has serious concerns with several other provisions in the bill and looks forward to \nworking with the Congress to address its concerns.  For example, the Administration opposes \nbarring Federal regulatory authorities from relying on the results of certain Federally-supported \nresearch and development.  This provision would set an extremely harmful precedent of political \ninterference in the scientific integrity of the regulation process, which would undermine the \nvalue of the Federal research and development enterprise as a whole.  The Administration also \nobjects to the increased administrative burdens that the bill imposes on NSF and its awardees \nwithout commensurate benefit.  In addition, the Administration opposes reducing oversight at the \nDOE National Laboratories, which would increase the exposure of the Federal Government to \nrisk and liabilities while also conflicting with the execution of the DOE mission.   \nH.R. 1806 undermines key investments in science, technology, and innovation and imposes \nunnecessary and damaging requirements on Federal support of research.  If the President were \npresented with H.R. 1806, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  September 16, 2015 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 758 - Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2015 \n (Rep. Smith, R-TX, and 6 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 758 because it is both unnecessary and \ncounterproductive.  H.R. 758 would limit the discretion of courts for violations of Rule 11 of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 11 requires attorneys to certify pre-filing that pleadings \nare not presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or \nneedlessly increase the cost of litigation.  H.R. 758 would require courts to impose monetary \nsanctions, including court costs and attorney fees, for any Rule 11 violation.  The bill would \neliminate the safe harbor provision that currently allows attorneys to correct or withdraw a filing \nbefore Rule 11 proceedings commence.  H.R. 758 would also circumvent the usual procedure for \namending the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n \nH.R. 758 was introduced to curb a perceived increase in frivolous litigation; however, the \nproposed changes to Rule 11 will actually increase litigation.  By creating an automatic financial \nincentive, and by removing the safe harbor provision, the proposed changes to Rule 11 could \ndramatically increase the number of sanctions motions, including those filed against Federal \ngovernment attorneys, and correspondingly increase the risk of financial exposure for any \nconduct that might be considered a Rule 11 violation.  In short, H.R. 758 would raise the amount \nand cost of civil litigation and provide more opportunity for unnecessary delay and harassment. \n \nThe Administration is particularly concerned that the new requirements could be used to target \nconsumer and civil rights plaintiffs.  Consumer abuse and civil rights cases can rely heavily on \nthe discovery process to prove the merits of their claims.  In addition, civil rights cases often \nseek to challenge the law or to extend existing precedents.  The threat of mandatory sanctions for \nfailure to withstand a Rule 11 challenge could chill meritorious claims by deterring worthy \nplaintiffs, who often lack the financial resources to pay costs and fees, from challenging existing \nlaws or seeking novel interpretations of them. \n \nThe bill is also opposed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the principal \npolicymaking body for the Judicial Branch charged with proposing amendments to the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure under the careful, deliberate process outlined in the Rules Enabling Act.  \nThe Congress has tasked the Judicial Conference to serve as the principal policymaking body for \nthe Judicial Branch.  The Congress has thus empowered the Federal judiciary to make its own \nprocedural rules, retaining the right to review those rules and to accept, modify, or reject them.  \nH.R. 758 is an attempt to amend the rules directly, over the objections of the Judicial \nConference. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n  October 26, 2015 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1090 \u2013 Retail Investor Protection Act \n(Rep.

It also impinges on the SEC\u2019s ability to move forward with \nits own rulemaking by requiring the SEC to take the misguided step of providing definitive \nfindings before promulgating a rule.  \n \nFurther, the bill ignores the fact that significant study has already been conducted by both \nagencies and that Labor has had extensive engagement with the public, industry, and numerous \nstakeholders in its rulemaking process.  This includes more than 140 days of public comment \nperiod, four days of public hearings, and approximately 100 meetings with stakeholders after the \nproposal was published in April.  Moreover, Labor and the SEC are already working closely to \nensure the smooth operation of the proposed safeguards, and this legislation would hamper \neffective coordination between the two agencies. \n \nUnder existing, outdated rules, savers cannot count on receiving the unbiased advice that they \nneed and expect.  This bill would effectively block action to protect working and middle-class \nfamilies from the harmful conflicts of interest that lead to biased advice.  The Council of \nEconomic Advisers estimates that these conflicts cost savers $17 billion every year.   \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that American workers and retirees are able to \nreceive advice about how to invest their money in safe, secure, and transparent financial products \nthat are free from harmful conflicts of interest.  Labor's ongoing rulemaking is designed to \nprotect the retirement savings of millions of workers and retirees by ensuring that paid advisors \nand other entities do not place their own financial interests over those of their customers.

Courts already have ample authority under the existing rules \ngoverning class actions to screen out frivolous and baseless lawsuits.  H.R. 1927 would expand \nupon the existing rules by requiring the plaintiffs in a class action to demonstrate that each \nmember of the proposed class suffered the same type and scope of injury.  This new requirement \nwould narrow the availability of class actions, potentially dissuading plaintiffs from pursuing \nmeritorious claims, including under important civil rights, privacy and consumer protection laws, \nand denying them access to justice.  Moreover, there is already an established process for \namending the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which is the more appropriate vehicle for \nventilating and potentially adopting the proposed revision of Rule 23 standards regarding class \nactions. \n \nIn addition, based on the false assertion that there is endemic fraud in the asbestos trust system, \nH.R. 1927 would impose mandatory reporting and disclosure requirements that would release \ninto the public domain asbestos victims' names, exposure histories, and other sensitive \ninformation.  This disclosure would threaten their privacy, make them more vulnerable to \nidentity thieves and other predators, and potentially disadvantage them in many ways unrelated \nto asbestos exposure, including in their efforts to obtain employment, credit, and insurance. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 1927, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nApril 14, 2016 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nSenate Substitute Amendment to H.R. 636 \u2013 Federal Aviation Administration \nReauthorization Act of 2016 \n(Sen. Thune, R-SD, and Sen. Nelson, D-FL)  \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Senate's bipartisan effort to advance an aviation \nreauthorization bill.  In the past, the Congress has managed the Federal Aviation Administration \n(FAA) through a series of short-term patches, creating significant uncertainty for the FAA and \nundermining the agency's ability to make long-term capital investments and plan for the \nfuture.  Though the Administration believes that eighteen months do not provide the long-term \ncertainty that the FAA needs to advance on its critical priorities, the Administration appreciates \nthat the bill is intended to enable a longer-term dialogue about the future of our aviation system. \n \nThe Administration's priorities for a long-term aviation reauthorization bill include the need to \nensure safety, serve the public interest, modernize the air traffic control system, and better align \naviation resources with the needs of the National Airspace (NAS).  The bill contains some \nprovisions that advance these priorities.  However, it also includes provisions that would \nundermine the FAA's ability to address critical challenges, like mandating controller hiring \npreferences and limiting FAA's ability to make business-like decisions about its services. \n \nThere are also a number of provisions within the bill that need to be improved, particularly as it \nrelates to safety, security, and the environment.  For example, with regards to safety, while the \nAdministration shares Congress' goal of fast and efficient integration of Unmanned Aircraft \nSystems (UAS) into the NAS, the FAA must be able to maintain regulatory flexibility.  The bill \nwould direct the Department of Transportation to develop certification standards for small UAS \nso that companies could engage in the widespread transportation of property two years from \npassage.  This kind of overly prescriptive means of integrating UAS using legislation would \ndisrupt the ongoing rulemaking process.  From a security perspective, the bill would require the \nTransportation Security Administration to establish screening and other measures at certain small \nairports, meaning the agency would be required to reallocate staff and equipment from higher-\nrisk, higher-need facilities. The bill also includes provisions related to air tours over national \nparks, which could negatively impact the visitor experience and protection of park natural \nresources. \n \nThe bill also should do more with regards to infrastructure investment.  For the past seven years, \nthe Administration has called on the Congress to provide flexibility to airports to invest in a \nstronger aviation system.  This bill misses an opportunity to improve airport infrastructure by not \nallowing for adjustments to Passenger Facility Charges in tandem with reforms to the Airport \nImprovement Program. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to pass an FAA reauthorization  bill that strengthens our aviation system, improves safety, and maintains the leadership of the \nU.S. in global aviation. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  November 29, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nHouse Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 34 \u2013 21st Century Cures Act  \n(Rules Committee Print) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports passage of the bipartisan House Amendment to the Senate \nAmendment to H.R. 34, the 21st Century Cures Act, which dedicates more than $6 billion to \nimplement key priorities such as the President's proposal to combat the heroin and prescription \nopioid epidemic; the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot; and the President's signature biomedical \nresearch initiatives, the Precision Medicine and Brain Research through Advancing Innovative \nNeurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiatives.  It also takes important steps to improve mental health, \nincluding provisions that build on the work of the President's Mental Health and Substance Use \nDisorder Parity Task Force, and includes policies to further modernize the drug approval \nprocess. \n \nThe legislation includes $1 billion over two years, including $500 million in Fiscal Year 2017, to \ncombat the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, consistent with the President's budget \nrequest.  More Americans now die every year from drug overdoses than they do in motor vehicle \ncrashes, and the majority involve opioids.  The opioid epidemic is devastating families and \ncommunities and straining the capacity of law enforcement and the healthcare system.  The \nresources included in the bill will allow states to expand access to treatment to help individuals \nseeking help to find it and to start the road to recovery, with preference given to states with an \nincidence or prevalence of opioid use disorders that is substantially higher relative to other states.   \n \nThe Administration is committed to taking immediate action to lay the groundwork to ensure that \nthe funds in the bill would be disbursed quickly and effectively so we can begin to address these \nimportant public health challenges. \n \nThe bill also includes $1.8 billion, including $1 billion over the next three years, to support the \nVice President's Cancer Moonshot.  The Moonshot aims to accelerate research efforts and make \nnew therapies available to more patients, while also improving our ability to prevent cancer and \ndetect it at an early stage.  The resources in this legislation will support investment in promising \nnew therapies like cancer immunotherapy, new prevention tools, cancer vaccine development, \nnovel early detection tools, and pediatric cancer interventions.  As the Vice President and \nscientific experts have said, we are at an inflection point in cancer research and this investment \ncould help seize this opportunity.  \n \nThe legislation also dedicates support for other key research initiatives.  In 2013, the President \nlaunched the BRAIN Initiative with the goal of helping researchers find new ways to treat, cure, \nand prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury.  In \n2015, he launched the Precision Medicine Initiative to pioneer a new model of patient-powered \nresearch that promises to accelerate biomedical discoveries and provide clinicians with new \ntools, knowledge, and therapies to select which treatments will work best for which  patients.  The bill creates dedicated funding of $1.5 billion for the BRAIN initiative and $1.4 \nbillion for the Precision Medicine Initiative to continue these signature Presidential Initiatives, \nwhich have broad bipartisan support, over the next decade.   \n \nThe legislation also includes bipartisan mental health reforms.  These include a renewed \nemphasis on evidence-based strategies for treating serious mental illness, improved coordination \nbetween primary care and behavioral health services, reauthorization of important programs \nfocused on suicide prevention and other prevention services, and mental health and substance use \ndisorder parity provisions that build on the work of the President's Mental Health and Substance \nUse Disorder Parity Task Force.   \n \nIn addition, the bill takes multiple steps to further the progress made in this Administration in \nimproving the drug development process.  It enhances the ongoing efforts to better incorporate \npatients' voices into the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision-making processes; \nsupports FDA's efforts to modernize clinical trial design; and improves FDA's ability to hire and \nretain scientific experts.  The legislation includes strong protections for individuals' health data, \nas well as provisions preventing unnecessary restrictions on the sharing of health information \ntechnology data with patients and providers.   \n \nThere are also provisions in the bill that raise concerns, but that have been modified from \nprevious versions to help address concerns, such as provisions that allow for the marketing of \ndrugs to payors for off-label uses.  In addition, a number of effective dates will be challenging to \nmeet, especially without additional administrative funding.  The requirement to sell additional \ninventory from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, when added to the sale requirements of the \nBipartisan Budget Act and the FAST Act, continues a bad precedent of selling off longer term \nenergy security assets to satisfy near term budget scoring needs. \n \nThat said, this legislation offers advances in health that far outweigh these concerns.  As such, \nthe Administration strongly supports passage of the House Amendment to the Senate \nAmendment to H.R. 34, the 21st Century Cures Act. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  September 16, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 348 \u2013 Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Marino, R-PA, and 21 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 348, which would undercut responsible decision-\nmaking and public involvement in the Federal environmental review and permitting \nprocesses.  As the Administration said when virtually identical legislation was considered \npreviously, H.R. 348 would increase litigation, regulatory delays, and potentially force agencies \nto approve a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed arbitrary \ndeadlines.  This legislation would complicate the regulatory process and create two sets of \nstandards for Federal agencies to follow to review projects \u2013 one for \"construction projects\" and \none for all other Federal actions, such as rulemakings or management plans.   \n \nThis Administration is committed to modernizing the Federal permitting and review process for \nmajor infrastructure projects to provide certainty for project applicants, reducing the aggregate \ntime it takes to conduct reviews and make permitting decisions, and producing measurably better \nenvironmental and community outcomes.  However, the Administration strongly rejects the \nlegislation's premise that public input and responsible agency decision-making under current law \nhinders job creation.  The Administration believes that H.R. 348, if enacted, would lead to more \nconfusion and delay, limit public participation in the permitting process, and ultimately hamper \neconomic growth.   \n \nThe Administration supports efforts to improve the efficiency of the environmental review \nprocesses without diminishing requirements for rigorous analyses, agency consultation, and \npublic participation.  Since 2011, the Administration has prioritized improving the environmental \nreview process and continues to make advancements in this space that will improve interagency \ncoordination and synchronization of reviews to increase decision-making speed; improve project \nsiting and application quality; expand innovative mitigation approaches; and drive accountability \nand transparency through the expanded use of an online permitting dashboard.  For example, \nunder Executive Order 13604, the interagency infrastructure permitting steering committee \nestablished the permitting dashboard, which makes project schedules transparent to the public \nand is designed to improve the timeliness and environmental outcomes of the permitting \nprocess.

Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5485, making appropriations for \nfinancial services and general government for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, \nand for other purposes. \n \nThe bill's reductions in funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) exacerbate the damaging \nreductions inflicted on the IRS since 2010, and irresponsibly cut funding for the agencies \ncharged with implementing Wall Street reform.  The bill also underfunds the Federal Trade \nCommission's efforts to promote economic competition. \n \nFurthermore, the legislation includes highly problematic ideological provisions, including \nprovisions that restrict the IRS's ability to implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA), interfere \nwith important new regulations designed to protect consumers from risky or abusive lending, and \nundermine the principle of home rule for the District of Columbia.  These provisions also prevent \nthe Federal Communications Commission from promoting a free and open internet and \nencouraging competition in the set-top box market, impacting millions of broadband and cable \ncustomers.  Furthermore, these provisions would bar Federal agency efforts to reduce the risks \nand costs of flood disasters.  Despite these shortcomings, the Administration welcomes the bill's \ninvestments in entrepreneurship and small business financing.   \n \nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated \nfor FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense \nspending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class \nfamilies, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that \nagreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  \nHowever, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological \nprovisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5485, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \n \n  Department of the Treasury \n \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS).  The Administration strongly objects to the $766 million \nreduction in funding for the IRS compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduction would \nbring IRS funding to FY 1993 levels, in real terms, hindering the agency's efforts to provide \nrobust service to taxpayers, improve enforcement operations, and implement new statutory \nresponsibilities.  Furthermore, these reductions would negatively impact efforts aimed at deficit \nreduction, with enforcement revenues in FY 2017 estimated to be more than $11 billion lower \nthan if FY 2010 staffing levels had been maintained.  In addition, the Administration strongly \nopposes sections of the bill that limit IRS funding and transfers to carry out implementation of the \nACA, under which millions of individuals have signed up for coverage through the Health \nInsurance Marketplaces.  The Administration also objects to provisions that unnecessarily \nencumber IRS operations with burdensome reporting requirements and that would constrain \nenforcement of tax laws. \n \nDepartmental Offices.  The Administration appreciates the support for targeted investments in \nDepartment-wide cybersecurity enhancements.  However, the Administration objects to the bill's \ndefunding of the Department's Systems and Capital Investment Program and is disappointed that \nthe bill fails to permit funding for oversight and administration of the Gulf Coast Restoration \nTrust Fund to be paid from the Trust Fund.  In total, the bill would require a $27.4 million \nreduction in funding from the comparable level in the FY 2017 Budget request for core \nDepartmental Offices Salaries and Expenses. \n \nCommunity Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund.  The Administration appreciates \nthe Committee's support for the CDFI Fund, which is funded above the FY 2017 Budget request.  \nHowever, the Administration is disappointed that the bill provides neither the $22 million \nrequested for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, which offers financial and technical \nassistance to expand the availability of healthy food options in distressed communities, nor the \n$10 million requested for the Small Dollar Loan Program to expand access to small dollar loans \nin underserved communities and combat predatory lending.  The Administration also appreciates \nthe continuation of the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program, but is concerned about the $250 million \nlimitation on new commitments, which is below the program's annual average commitment \nlevel.  This lower level of commitment authority would unnecessarily constrain the provision of \nlong-term capital in low-income and underserved communities. \n \nOffice of Financial Research (OFR) and Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  The \nAdministration strongly opposes section 130 of the bill, which would subject OFR and FSOC to \nthe annual appropriations process beginning in FY 2018.  This language would hinder the \nindependence of these entities and limit their ability to develop critical market analysis and \nimprove regulator coordination if future funding shortfalls prevent information technology (IT) \ninvestments or the hiring of highly-skilled staff.  The Administration also opposes onerous new \nprocedural requirements that could effectively prohibit FSOC from formally designating \nnonbank financial companies whose material financial distress could pose a threat to U.S. \nfinancial stability.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes section 129 of the bill, which \nwould require OFR to publish notice 90 days prior to issuing any report, rule, or regulation; \nresearch reports are intended to provide independent analysis of the facts, unswayed by public or \npolitical sentiment. \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration \n2  appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for the Bureau of the \nFiscal Service for Government-wide implementation of the DATA Act, and urges the Congress \nto fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Department of the Treasury's own \nimplementation of the DATA Act.  This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent \nFederal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business \nprocesses, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID. \n \nExecutive Office of the President (EOP) \n \nEOP Funding and Operations.  The Administration objects to section 621 of the bill, which \nwould continue a prohibition on paying salaries and expenses for certain White House staff \npositions and impinge on the President's ability to organize EOP operations.  The Administration \nappreciates funding for Presidential transition costs but strongly objects to the lack of funding for \nUnanticipated Needs, which would severely hamper the President's ability to meet unexpected \nrequirements for the furtherance of the national interest, security, or defense.  The \nAdministration also objects to the funding level in the bill for the National Security Council, \nwhich is $2.1 million below the FY 2017 Budget request. \n \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB).  The Administration strongly opposes the funding \nlevel in the bill for OMB, which is $10 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  This \nreduction would significantly diminish OMB's ability to carry out its mission.  The \nAdministration also objects to continuation of bill language that would require burdensome \nOMB cost estimates to accompany the issuance of all Executive Orders, as well as language that \nrequires OMB to submit a report to the Congress estimating the costs of implementing the Dodd-\nFrank Act, an onerous and duplicative report of limited value. \n \nInformation Technology Oversight and Reform (ITOR).  The Administration strongly opposes \nthe funding level in the bill for the ITOR account, which is $10 million below the FY 2017 \nBudget request.  ITOR funds important efforts to improve the most critical public-facing Federal \ndigital services through the application of best practices in product design and engineering by the \nU.S. Digital Service and its agency partners.  The ITOR fund also supports efforts to protect \nFederal systems through implementation of leading solutions to address new and constantly \nevolving advanced, persistent cyber-threats, drive value in Federal IT investments, and \nimplement the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act.  The bill's reductions to \nthese initiatives would undermine efforts to secure the Nation's highest value information targets \nand build on successful reforms to the Federal Government's management of IT resources, which \nhave resulted in about $3.6 billion in cost savings and avoidance. \n \nGeneral Services Administration (GSA) \n \nOverall GSA Funding.  Funding for GSA is an integral part of supporting agencies in their \nperformance of critical missions.  The bill's funding level would undermine GSA's ability to \ndeliver services, impacting agencies Government-wide.  \n \nFederal Buildings Fund (FBF).  The Administration finds the bill's funding level for the FBF \nunacceptable at nearly $934 million below the FY 2017 Budget request and the anticipated level \nof rent collections from other Federal agencies in FY 2017.  The bill also denies critical \nconstruction funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Headquarters project and the \nnext phase of the Department of Homeland Security's headquarters consolidation at St. \n3  Elizabeths, Washington, D.C.  Since FY 2011, the Committee has chosen to fund the FBF at \nlevels billions below what GSA collects in rent from agencies.  Underfunding construction and \nrenovation is particularly damaging, as the Government must be a good steward of its own \nassets, able to take advantage of opportunities to save money over the long term and maintain its \nbuildings adequately to avoid more costly failures in the future.  Further, the practice of \nchronically underfunding the FBF is unfair to other Federal agencies, who are no longer \nreceiving the space and services that they are paying for, as well as to the other appropriations \nsubcommittees who are providing funds that are never used for their intended purpose. \n  \nFBI Headquarters.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the full request in \nthe FY 2017 Budget for the new consolidated FBI headquarters facility.  The bill provides only \n$200 million, $559 million below the FY 2017 Budget request for GSA for construction of the \nnew FBI headquarters.  In total, the FY 2017 Budget requests $1.4 billion for the FBI \nheadquarters project\u2014 $646 million for FBI and $759 million for GSA's Federal Building Fund.  \nFull funding of the FY 2017 Budget request is required for GSA to award a design and \nconstruction contract for the project this year.  Absent a new, modern, and secure headquarters \nfacility, the ability of the FBI to fully support its critical national security and law enforcement \nmissions may be compromised. \n  \nInformation Technology (IT) Modernization Fund.  The Administration is concerned that the \nCommittee does not provide the requested $100 million for the IT Modernization Fund (ITMF), \npart of a larger $3.1 billion request in the FY 2017 Budget that creates a revolving fund to retire \nand replace legacy IT systems across Government.  Absent funding for the ITMF, the cost to \noperate and maintain legacy systems, as well as security vulnerabilities and other risks, would \ncontinue to grow. \n  \nUnified Shared Services Management (USSM).  The Administration urges the Congress to \nsupport the $5 million requested in the FY 2017 Budget for the establishment of the USSM, a new \norganization housed in GSA that would serve as an integration body for the shared services \nenvironment.  The funding is needed to give the USSM a stable funding source. \n \nSmall Business Administration (SBA) \n \nSBA Support for Businesses.  The Administration appreciates the strong support for small \nbusinesses through the bill's robust funding for the SBA's business loan and entrepreneurial \ndevelopment programs.  The SBA's business loan programs would support over $46 billion in \nlending to small businesses in FY 2017, and the increased funding for technical assistance and \ndevelopment programs would ensure business owners can effectively deploy capital to grow \ntheir businesses and create good jobs.  However, the Administration opposes the elimination of \nfunding for Regional Innovation Cluster grants and Growth Accelerators, as these innovative \nprograms help regions leverage their unique assets to create jobs by turning entrepreneurial ideas \ninto sustainable high-growth small businesses. \n \nDisaster Loans Program.  The Administration urges the Congress to utilize the disaster relief cap \nadjustment authorized in the Budget Control Act of 2011 to fund the $159 million FY 2017 \nBudget request for SBA's administrative costs associated with major disasters.  By not utilizing \nthe cap adjustment, the bill makes unnecessary reductions to other programs to accommodate \nthis line of support to small businesses after a disaster has struck. \n \n4  Other Independent Agencies \n \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Administration strongly objects to the funding \nlevel of $1.55 billion for SEC, which is $226 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  The \nbill would hinder SEC's enforcement, examination, and market oversight functions and undercut \ninvestor protections strengthened by Wall Street Reform that benefit both consumers and Main \nStreet.  The bill would also shortchange SEC's core programs by mandating that funding for IT \ninitiatives increase by $50 million over the FY 2016 enacted level and prohibiting authorized IT \nspending from the agency's mandatory Reserve Fund.  Taken together, these provisions would \ninhibit SEC's ability to improve oversight and examination functions in a way that investors \nexpect and deserve.  The SEC is fee-funded and its funding level has no impact on the deficit, \nnor does it impact the amount of funding available for other agencies. \n \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The Administration strongly opposes sections \n502 and 503 of the bill that subject CFPB to annual appropriations and politicizes its leadership, \nwhich would severely weaken its independence and undermine its ability to serve the most \nvulnerable consumer populations.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes sections 506, \n637, 638, and 639 of the bill that undermine key consumer protections by preventing the CFPB \nfrom finalizing or implementing payday lending and arbitration regulations and would amend the \nTruth in Lending Act to deny borrowers protections from certain high-cost loans.  These are \nproblematic, ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of this bill. \n \nConsumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).  The Administration objects to the total funding \nlevel of $120 million for CPSC, an $11 million reduction below the FY 2017 Budget request.  \nThis funding level would significantly impede CPSC's public safety mission intended to \nsafeguard consumers, particularly children, from hidden hazards that continue to cause death and \nsevere injuries, including its ability to expand the import surveillance program through which \nCPSC identifies hazardous products that can cause injury or death before these goods can enter \nthe U.S. market.  In addition, the Administration objects to section 510 of the bill that would \ncontinue to prohibit CPSC from using funds to finalize or implement mandatory standards for \nrecreational off-highway vehicles (ROVs) until CPSC commissions and completes a study with \nthe National Academy of Sciences.  This provision could indefinitely delay CPSC's ability to \ncomplete rulemaking on ROVs, potentially compromising public safety.  The language also \nwould undermine the Commission's statutory independence and authority to write public safety \nregulations, interfering with its regulatory independence and public safety mission. \n \nElection Assistance Commission (EAC).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the \nfull $9.8 million requested for EAC in the FY 2017 Budget, including $1.5 million for the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology.  The $4.9 million provided in the bill is half of \nthe funding requested in the FY 2017 Budget.  Such a significant reduction would severely limit \nEAC's ability to assist State and local entities administer Federal elections, test and certify voting \nequipment, and provide information about voting system standards. \n \nFederal Communications Commission (FCC).  The Administration strongly opposes the deep \nreductions to the funding level for FCC, which is $53 million, or 14 percent, below the FY 2017 \nBudget request.  These reductions unnecessarily force FCC to scale back important work on \npublic safety and wireless spectrum, delay efforts to modernize IT systems, and undermine \nefforts to save the taxpayers money by consolidating office space and improving oversight of the \nUniversal Service Fund.  The Administration objects to the $106 million cap on auction program \n5  funding, which is $18 million, or 15 percent, below the FY 2017 Budget request.  This would \nseverely harm the FCC's efforts to modernize its auction infrastructure to support the \nincreasingly complex auctions of the future, which have the potential to return tens of billions of \ndollars to the U.S. Treasury. \n \nFCC, Open Internet Order.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 630, 631, and 632 \nthat aim at delaying or preventing implementation of FCC's net neutrality order.  The order, \nwhich was issued after a lengthy rulemaking process that garnered input from four million \nAmericans, ensures a level playing field that is increasingly vital to the future of the Nation's \ndigital economy and online competition.  For almost a century, U.S. law has recognized that \ncompanies who connect Americans to the world have special obligations not to exploit the \nmonopoly they enjoy over access in and out of Americans' homes or businesses.  It is common \nsense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of \ninformation\u2014whether a phone call, or a packet of data.  The FCC's rules recognize that \nbroadband service is of the same importance, and must carry the same obligations as so many of \nthe other vital services do.  These carefully-designed rules have already been implemented in \nlarge part with little to no impact on the telecommunications companies making important \ninvestments in the U.S. economy, and would ensure that neither the cable company nor the \nphone company would be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what Americans can do or see \nonline.  The appropriations process should not be used to overturn the will of both an \nindependent regulator and millions of Americans on this vital issue. \n \nFCC, Set-top Rule.  The Administration opposes section 636 that aims at delaying the FCC from \nadopting or enforcing new rules to open the video set-top box market to additional competition.  \nCurrently, 99 percent of cable and satellite TV consumers rent set-top boxes directly from the \ncable providers, costing households an average of $230 per year.  The FCC is already committed \nto a lengthy, thorough rulemaking process that would establish a robust record of comment and \nanalysis from companies, non-profit organizations, and academics.  The current provision \nunnecessarily interferes with these long-established processes by requiring a delay of at least 270 \ndays, and probably much longer, and a redundant, potentially costly study. \n \nFederal Trade Commission (FTC).  The Administration is concerned that the Committee is \nunderfunding the efforts by the FTC and the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Antitrust Division to \nprotect American consumers from criminal cartel practices\u2014such as price fixing, fraud, and \ncurrency manipulation\u2014and anticompetitive mergers.  Since 2010, the number of proposed \n$1 billion \"mega mergers\" reviewed annually by the FTC and DOJ's Antitrust Division has more \nthan doubled.  Anticompetitive mergers can harm American consumers significantly by raising \nprices, reducing quality, limiting output, restricting consumer choice, and stifling innovation in \nmarkets such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals, defense contracting, energy and petroleum, cable \ntelevision and internet, cell phones and service, airline travel, appliances, and common food \nitems.  The bill provides $317 million for the FTC, $25 million below the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest. \n \nUnited States Postal Service.  The Administration strongly opposes new language in the bill that \nwould roll back cost saving measures implemented by the Postal Service over the last four years.  \nThe Administration is also disappointed that language under the Payment to the Postal Service \nFund account would prohibit the Postal Service from modifying its delivery schedule to better \nadapt to its current business environment.  Each year, the President's Budget has proposed \nbalanced reforms to provide the Postal Service with the operational flexibility to continue to \n6  meet its universal service obligation and implement structural changes that would help put it on a \nsustainable trajectory.  While the Congress has failed to act, the Postal Service has undertaken \nsignificant administrative reforms under existing authority to reduce expenses.  Despite these \nefforts, since FY 2012 the Postal Service has been forced to default each year on scheduled \npayments to reduce its unfunded liability for retiree health benefits and is expected to default on \nan additional $5.8 billion due during FY 2016.  The Postal Service estimates that reversing four \nyears of service changes would increase its operating deficit by roughly $1.5 billion annually and \nimpose an additional $500 million in one-time costs. \n \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB).  The Administration objects to the \nfunding level of $8.3 million in the bill for the PCLOB, which is $1.8 million, or more than 17 \npercent, below the FY 2017 Budget request.  The funding level provided would impair PCLOB's \nability to maintain sufficient staff to independently and robustly assess the multi-billion dollar \ncounterterrorism enterprise's efforts to balance privacy and civil liberties.  The Congress and the \nExecutive Branch have asked the Board to analyze a number of complex issues that are subject \nto ongoing public debate, including electronic surveillance.  The impact of the funding reduction \non the Board's staffing would hinder its ability to satisfy these requests.  \n \nUdall Foundation.  The Administration opposes the elimination of funding requested in the \nFY 2017 Budget for the Udall Foundation, which provides education and research resources to \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives.  In addition, through the U.S. Institute for Environmental \nConflict Resolution, the Foundation provides mediation services for conflicts involving Federal \nagencies or interests.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Udall Foundation \nat the $5 million level included in the FY 2017 Budget request. \n \nDistrict of Columbia (D.C.) \n \nD.C. Local Budget Autonomy.  The Administration does not object to the one-year shutdown \nexemption in section 816 of the bill, which would allow D.C. to spend local funds in the event of \na lapse in appropriations in FY 2018.  However, the Administration strongly objects to section \n817 of the bill, which repeals the D.C. Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012.  The residents of \nthe District and their elected leaders deserve to have the same ability as other U.S. residents and \nelected leaders to determine how to use their local revenues.  Such authority is fundamental to a \nwell-functioning democracy and the denial of such authority is an affront to the residents and \nleaders of the District.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt provisions included in \nthe FY 2017 Budget request that would permanently allow the District to use local funds without \ncongressional action. \n \nRestrictions on the District's Use of Local Funds.  The Administration strongly opposes language \nin the bill that bars the elected leaders of the District of Columbia from determining how to use \nlocal revenues.  Specifically, the Administration strongly opposes section 810 of the bill, which \nprohibits the District from using both Federal and local funds for abortion services for low-\nincome women.  Longstanding policy prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortions, \nexcept in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered, but \nrestrictions on the District's use of local funds for abortion services is contrary to the principle of \nhome rule.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes the restriction in section 809(b) of \nthe bill on the use of both Federal and local funds for regulatory or legislative activity pertaining \nto recreational use of marijuana, which was approved by D.C. voters.  The Administration urges \nthe Congress to adopt the provisions in the FY 2017 Budget request that limit the abortion and \n7  recreational marijuana restrictions to Federal funds. \n \nD.C. Syringe Services Program.  The Administration strongly opposes the restriction in the bill \non the use of Federal funds for the District's syringe services program.  This is contrary to current \nlaw, which prohibits the use of Federal funds for syringe services programs only in locations \nwhere local authorities determine such programs to be inappropriate. \n \nD.C. Education Funding.  The Administration strongly opposes the $20 million funding level in \nthe bill for the Tuition Assistance Grant Program (TAG), which is $20 million below the \nFY 2017 Budget request level.  TAG provides grants of up to $10,000 per year to District \nresidents to cover the difference between in-State and out-of-State tuition at public colleges and \nuniversities and helps to make college affordable for many low-income District residents.  In \naddition, the Administration opposes the $30 million funding level in the bill for D.C. public \nschools, which is $10 million below the FY 2017 Budget request, and the Administration \nstrongly opposes the additional $12 million the bill provides for the Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram (OSP), a private school voucher program.  The Administration appreciates the bill's \nsupport for evaluation and administration of OSP and will continue to use available OSP funds to \nsupport students returning to the program until they complete school, but strongly opposes \nadditional funding for more vouchers.  The Administration remains focused on improving the \nquality of public schools for all children rather than supporting a handful of students in private \nschools. \n \nD.C. Water and Sewer Authority.  The Administration opposes the bill's lack of funding for D.C. \nWater and urges the Congress to provide the $14 million included in the FY 2017 Budget request \nfor ongoing work on the combined sewer overflow project. \n \nOther Issues \n \nFinancial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2016.  The Administration is concerned by the inclusion \nof Title XI in an appropriations act.  Revisions to the bankruptcy code have no place in an \nappropriations bill and the Financial Institutional Bankruptcy Act of 2016 (HR 2947) has been \nreferred to the Senate where it should be considered in due course.   \n \nAbortion Coverage Under Multi-State plans Administered by the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM).  The bill would expand current prohibitions on funding for abortion \nservices and related administrative expenses in connection with Multi-state Plans (MSPs) \nadministered by OPM.  Section 641 appears to preclude OPM from spending any funds \nappropriated by this Act to administer MSPs that cover abortion services with non-Federal funds \nunder segregated funding requirements.  This expansion is not necessary to protect Federal funds \nand would restrict private insurance choices as well as women's access to healthcare. \n \nCoal-Fired Power Plant Protections.  The Administration opposes section 131 of the bill, which \nwould prohibit the use of FY 2017 appropriated funds for the enforcement of rules, regulations, \npolicies, or guidelines implemented pursuant to certain Administration policies intended to limit \npublic financing for coal-fired or other high-carbon-intensity power projects overseas\u2014policies \nthat have catalyzed similar commitments from other major exporting countries and multilateral \nfinancial institutions.  These prohibitions impede U.S. leadership in reducing carbon pollution, \npromoting climate solutions and preparedness, and meeting our responsibility to future \ngenerations. \n8   \nCuba.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 132, 133, 134, and 135, which would \nseverely undermine the President's policy on Cuba that aims to improve the lives of the Cuban \npeople and advance U.S. interests through expanded travel, commerce, and the free flow of \ninformation.  The Administration strongly opposes section 132 on non-academic educational \nexchanges, as it would result in a reduction of people-to-people interactions and as such is \ncounter to the Administration's policy to increase overall travel and the flow of information and \nresources to private Cubans.  This provision is an unwarranted restriction on purposeful travel to \nCuba by U.S. citizens, who are the best ambassadors to the Cuban people of our values and \nideals.  The Administration also strongly opposes section 133 regarding property confiscated by \nthe Cuban Government, which could severely chill authorized U.S.-Cuba commerce designed to \nsupport the Cuban people.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes section 134, which \nis overly broad and, as written, could significantly undermine the ability for U.S. persons to \nengage in otherwise authorized business in order to more effectively support the Cuban people.   \n \nFederal Flood Risk Management Standard, Executive Order (E.O.) 13690.  The Administration \nobjects to section 745 of the bill, which prohibits any funds from being used to implement, \nadminister, carry out, modify, revise, or enforce E.O. 13690 entitled \"Establishing a Federal Flood \nRisk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder \nInput,\" until certain conditions are met.  If enacted, this provision would undermine Federal \nagencies' ability to protect Federal investments and could make communities more vulnerable to \nflood risks. \n \nPublic-Private Competition.  The Administration opposes elimination of the moratorium on \npublic-private competition between Government employees and private sector contractors to \nperform commercial activities that support agency missions.  OMB continues to work with \nagencies on efforts to ensure the most effective mix of Federal employees and contractors and \nbelieves more time is needed for efforts to ensure core in-house capabilities for critical functions \ntake effect before the moratorium is lifted.  The Administration urges the Congress to continue \nthe moratorium in FY 2017, as proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request. \n \nDelayed Implementation of E.O. 13673.  The Administration objects to section 640, which would \ndelay implementation of E.O. 13673 entitled \"Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces,\" until the \nGovernment Accountability Office conducts a comprehensive study on the effects of the E.O. \nand the Secretary of Labor certifies that the benefits of the order outweigh any costs.  Such a \ndelay is unnecessary and would forestall implementation of important safeguards established by \nthe President to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not reward corporations that break labor laws and \nthereby jeopardize the performance and cost of Federal contracting.  Over the nearly two years \nsince the E.O. was issued, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council and the Department of \nLabor have conducted a measured and highly deliberative process to implement the E.O., which \nincluded publication of a proposed rule and guidance in May 2015 that generated nearly 20,000 \npublic comments.  Any final rule would need to be accompanied by a comprehensive regulatory \nimpact analysis that responds to public comments and explains, among other things, how the rule \nimproves economy and efficiency and the alternatives that were considered to minimize burden \non small businesses. \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the \nFY 2017 Budget request for OPM and the National Archives and Records Administration to \ndevelop U.S. Digital Service teams.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to fully \n9  fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Department of the Treasury, GSA, and SBA to develop \ntheir U.S. Digital Service teams.  This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that \nhave the greatest impact on citizens and businesses. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSeveral provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns, including sections 204 and 205, \nrelating to the President's authority to execute and interpret Federal laws, including the \nConstitution; section 621, relating to the President's authority to supervise and oversee the \nExecutive Branch; and section 713, relating to the disclosure of certain classified and other \nprivileged information. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n10  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n) \nMay 19, 2015 \n                    (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2353 \u2013 Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Shuster, R-PA, and Rep. Ryan, R-WI) \n \nWith surface transportation funding authorization running out at the end of this month and \nhundreds of thousands of jobs at risk, the Administration does not oppose passage of H.R. 2353, \nrecognizing that a short-term extension of these authorities will be necessary in order for the \nCongress to complete work on a long-term bill that increases investment to meet the Nation's \ninfrastructure needs.  Unfortunately, H.R. 2353 represents yet one more short-term extension \ncoming on top of the several short-term extensions that preceded it. This continuing pattern of \nuncertainty has already caused several States to cancel or defer projects during the height of \nsummer construction season and has undermined the ability of States and localities to keep \nAmericans at work building and repairing the Nation's roads, bridges, and transit systems.   \n \nThe President and Congressional Democrats have been very clear that increasing investment in \nthe Nation's infrastructure is a top priority.  That is why the President laid out a vision for a 21st \ncentury surface transportation infrastructure, the GROW AMERICA Act, which would provide \nrobust funding for all modes of surface transportation.  The GROW AMERICA Act would also \nstreamline project approval processes and implement innovative transportation policies that will \nmake better use of taxpayer dollars while supporting millions of jobs, improving safety, and \npositioning the Nation's economy for lasting growth.  That proposal is fully paid for through \nexisting revenues and by reforming the business tax system to help create jobs and spur \ninvestment while eliminating loopholes that reward companies for moving profits overseas. \n \nThe Administration is focused every day on what can be done to expand opportunity for every \nAmerican.  In today's economy, that means building a first-class transportation system that \nattracts first-class jobs and takes American businesses' goods all across the world.  The Nation \nneeds a multi-year authorization bill that makes significant and long-term investments in \ninfrastructure.  It is time for the Congress to end the era of short-term patches and chronic \nunderinvestment.  The Administration will not support continued failure in making the \ninvestments the Nation needs. The Administration expects that the Congress will use this two-\nmonth extension to make meaningful and demonstrable progress towards a significant bill in \n2015. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress towards this end.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nApril 14, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH. R. 622 \u2013 State and Local Sales Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Brady, R-Texas, and 43 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration supports measures to make the Nation's tax code fairer and simpler for \nmiddle-class and working families.  The President's Budget includes a number of proposals \nthat would streamline existing tax breaks and provide additional tax relief to millions of \nfamilies, helping paychecks go further to cover the cost of child care, college, and a secure \nretirement.  The President's proposals are fully paid for primarily by closing tax loopholes for \nthe highest-income Americans.  \nHowever, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 622, which would \npermanently extend the tax deduction for State and local sales taxes without offsetting the \ncost, adding to long-term deficits.  Current law allows taxpayers who itemize to claim a \ndeduction for State and local sales taxes, in lieu of a deduction for State and local income \ntaxes.  By making permanent the deduction for State and local sales taxes, H.R. 622 would \nadd $42 billion to the deficit over the next ten years.  The bill violates the very standard that \nHouse Republicans approved just last month in their budget resolution, which requires \noffsetting the cost of any tax extenders that are made permanent with other revenue \nmeasures. \nAs with other similar proposals, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the \ndeficit to continue costly tax breaks, while slashing investments and programs that serve \nmiddle-class and working Americans in the name of fiscal rectitude.  If this same, \nunprecedented approach of making certain traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets \nwere followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to \ndeficits over the next ten years, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the \nAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.  House Republicans are also making clear their \npriorities by rushing to make costly tax extenders permanent and provide hundreds of billions \nof dollars of additional tax cuts for a few multi-million dollar estates, even as the House \nRepublican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 26 million working families and \nstudents by letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax \nCredit, and education tax credits expire. \nThe Administration wants to work with the Congress to make progress on measures that \nstrengthen the economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax \nreform.  However, H.R. 622 represents the wrong approach.  If the President were presented \nwith H.R. 622, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nApril 13, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 685 \u2014 Mortgage Choice Act of 2015\n(Rep. Huizenga, R-Michigan, and 37 cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 685, which would weaken key consumer protections \nand provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.   \nA fundamental component of Wall Street Reform is its requirement that lenders, before \nextending mortgage loans, make reasonable, good faith determinations that mortgage borrowers \nhave the ability to repay the loans.  The law provides lenders with protection from liability under \nthis requirement if their loans satisfy certain clear criteria and thus are \"Qualified Mortgages.\"  \nOne of the criteria is that the up-front costs (\"points and fees\") not exceed three percent of the \ntotal loan amount.  During the housing bubble, many lenders front-loaded mortgage loans with \npoints and fees and therefore had less incentive to determine a borrower\u2019s ability to repay.  \nMoreover, excessive, front-loaded points and fees contributed to predatory lending behavior, \n\"steering\" borrowers into more expensive mortgage loans.   \nH.R. 685 would revise the Truth in Lending Act to allow certain charges to be excluded from the \ndefinition of points and fees even when the lender or its affiliates receives the fees.  By \nexempting certain fees from the three percent cap, H.R. 685 would allow lenders to increase the \ncost of loans and still be eligible for \"Qualified Mortgage\" treatment.  This revision risks eroding \nconsumer protections and returning the mortgage market to the days of careless lending focused \non short-term profits. \nBecause H.R. 685 would weaken key consumer protections and provisions of the Dodd-Frank \nWall Street Reform Act, if the President were presented with H.R. 685, his senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto the bill.    \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nOctober 22, 2015 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 754 \u2013 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 \n(Sen. Burr, R-NC) \n \nAn important building block for improving the Nation\u2019s cybersecurity is ensuring that private \nentities can collaborate to share timely cyber threat information with each other and the Federal \nGovernment.  In January, the President submitted a legislative proposal to the Congress with the \ngoal of, among other things, facilitating greater information sharing amongst the private sector \nand with the Federal Government.  The Administration\u2019s proposal provides a focused approach \nto incentivize more cybersecurity information sharing while ensuring the protection of privacy, \nconfidentiality, and civil liberties.  As the Administration has previously stated, information \nsharing legislation must carefully safeguard privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties, preserve \nthe long-standing respective roles and missions of civilian and intelligence agencies, and provide \nfor appropriate sharing with targeted liability protections.  The Administration is encouraged by \nthe strong bipartisan support for cybersecurity information sharing legislation in the Congress.   \n \nThe Administration appreciates that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence adopted several \namendments to S. 754 to address some of the Administration's most significant concerns and is \nfurther encouraged that the bill\u2019s sponsor has proposed additional changes on the Senate floor.  \nThis work has strengthened the legislation and incorporated important modifications to better \nprotect privacy.  As such, the Administration supports Senate passage of S. 754, while \ncontinuing to work with the Congress as S.754 moves through the legislative process to ensure \nfurther important changes are made to the bill, including, but not limited to, preserving the \nleadership of civilian agencies in domestic cybersecurity.   \n \nThe Administration supports S. 754\u2019s requirement that an entity sharing information with the \nFederal Government must share that information through the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) in order to receive liability protections.  Moreover, S. 754 requires that such sharing be \ngoverned by privacy protection guidelines and that DHS must further disseminate such \ninformation in real-time with other Federal agencies.  The Administration supports real-time \nsharing amongst Federal agencies with appropriate privacy protections, and is currently \ndeveloping such a capability at DHS.  Focusing real-time sharing through one center at DHS \nenhances situational awareness, facilitates robust privacy controls, and helps to ensure oversight \nof such sharing.  In addition, centralizing this sharing mechanism through DHS will facilitate \nmore effective real-time sharing with other agencies in the most efficient manner.   \n \nTherefore, in order to ensure a focused approach and to facilitate streamlined information sharing \nwhile ensuring robust privacy protections, the Administration will strongly oppose any \namendments that would provide additional liability-protected sharing channels, including \nexpanding any exceptions to the DHS portal.  In addition, the Administration remains concerned \nthat the bill\u2019s authorization to share with any Federal entity, notwithstanding any other provision \nof law, weakens the bill\u2019s requirement that information be shared with a civilian entity.  This  remains a significant concern, and the Administration is eager to work with the Congress to seek \na workable solution.   \n \nS. 754 authorizes the use of certain potentially disruptive defensive measures in response to \nnetwork incidents, provisions that were not included in the Administration\u2019s proposal.  The use \nof defensive measures raises significant legal, policy, and diplomatic concerns and, without \nappropriate safeguards, can have a direct deleterious impact on foreign policy, the integrity of \ninformation systems, and cybersecurity.  The Administration is encouraged, however, that the \nbill\u2019s sponsor has proposed changes that would limit an entity from employing a defensive \nmeasure that would provide it unauthorized access to another entity\u2019s network.  Though the \nAdministration remains concerned that the bill\u2019s authorization to operate defensive measures \nmay prevent the application of other laws such as State common-law tort remedies, it is \nencouraged that the additional changes will help to appropriately constrain the use of defensive \nmeasures.  The Administration is committed to continue working with stakeholders to address \nremaining concerns. \n \nThe Administration commends the Committee for recognizing that cybersecurity requires a \nwhole-of-government approach and that information must be appropriately shared within the \nFederal Government.  This sharing must be consistent with certain narrow cybersecurity use \nrestrictions, as well as privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties protections and transparent \noversight.  The Administration commends the Committee for requiring that intra-governmental \nsharing be governed by a set of policies and procedures developed by the Federal Government to \nprotect privacy and civil liberties.  The Administration is encouraged that the bill\u2019s sponsor has \nproposed changes that would preserve the Federal Government\u2019s ability to implement privacy \nprotective policies and procedures.  The Administration is encouraged by changes the bill\u2019s \nsponsor has proposed to ensure that information sharing provided for in the bill is narrowly \nfocused on the important purpose of this bill, the protection of information systems and \ninformation from cybersecurity threats and security vulnerabilities.  Finally, the Administration \nis pleased that S.754 includes provisions that will improve the cybersecurity of Federal networks \nand systems.  Consistent with the bill\u2019s requirements, the Administration will implement this \nauthority in a manner that both enhances cybersecurity and continues to protect the \nconfidentiality, availability, and integrity of Federal agencies\u2019 data. \n \nInformation sharing is one piece of a larger suite of legislation needed to provide the private \nsector, the Federal Government, and law enforcement with the necessary tools to combat cyber \nthreats, and create for consumers and businesses a strong and consistent notification standard for \nbreaches of personal data.  In addition to updating information sharing statutes, the Congress \nshould incorporate privacy, confidentiality protection, and civil liberties safeguards into all \naspects of cybersecurity legislation.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                                                                                                 September 16, 2015 \n                              (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3134 \u2013 Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 \n(Rep.

Planned Parenthood uses both Federal and non-Federal funds to provide a range of \nimportant preventive care and health services, including health screenings, vaccinations, and \ncheck-ups to millions of men and women who visit their health centers annually. Longstanding \nFederal policy already prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or \nincest or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  By eliminating Federal funding for a \nmajor provider of health care, H.R. 3134 would limit access to health care for men, women, and \nfamilies across the Nation, and would disproportionately impact low-income individuals.   \n \nH.R. 3504 would impose new legal requirements related to the provision of abortion services \nin certain circumstances, which would likely have a chilling effect, reducing access to care. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3134 or H.R. 3504, he would veto them. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n                                                                                                                        November 18, 2015 \n                    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4038 - American SAFE Act of 2015 \n(Rep. McCaul, R-TX, and Rep. Hudson, R-NC) \n \nThe Administration's highest priority is to ensure the safety and security of the American people. \nThat is why refugees of all nationalities, including Syrians and Iraqis, considered for admission \nto the United States undergo the most rigorous and thorough security screening of anyone \nadmitted into the United States.  This legislation would introduce unnecessary and impractical \nrequirements that would unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist some of the most vulnerable \npeople in the world, many of whom are victims of terrorism, and would undermine our partners \nin the Middle East and Europe in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis.  The Administration \ntherefore strongly opposes H.R. 4038. \n \nThe current screening process involves multiple Federal intelligence, security, and law \nenforcement agencies, including the National Counterterrorism Center, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, and the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), State, and Defense, all aimed \nat ensuring that those admitted do not pose a threat to our country.  These safeguards include \nbiometric (fingerprint) and biographic checks, medical screenings, and a lengthy interview by \nspecially trained DHS officers who scrutinize the applicant's explanation of individual \ncircumstances to assess whether the applicant meets statutory requirements to qualify as a \nrefugee and that he or she does not present security concerns to the United States.  Mindful of the \nparticular conditions of the Syria crisis, Syrian refugees \u2013 who have had their lives uprooted by \nconflict and continue to live amid conditions so harsh that many set out on dangerous, often \ndeadly, journeys seeking new places of refuge \u2013 go through additional forms of security \nscreening, including a thorough pre-interview analysis of each individual's refugee application.  \nAdditionally, DHS interviewers receive extensive, Syria-specific training before meeting with \nrefugee applicants.  Of the 2,174 Syrian refugees admitted to the United States since September \n11, 2001, not a single one has been arrested or deported on terrorism-related grounds. \n \nThe certification requirement at the core of H.R. 4038 is untenable and would provide no \nmeaningful additional security for the American people, instead serving only to create significant \ndelays and obstacles in the fulfillment of a vital program that satisfies both humanitarian and \nnational security objectives.  No refugee is approved for travel to the United States under the \ncurrent system until the full array of required security vetting measures have been completed. \nThus, the substantive result sought through this draft legislation is already embedded into the \nprogram. The Administration recognizes the importance of a strong, evolving security screening \nin our refugee admissions program and devotes considerable resources to continually improving \nthe Nation's robust security screening protocols.  The measures called for in this bill would divert \nresources from these efforts.   \n \nGiven the lives at stake and the critical importance to our partners in the Middle East and Europe \nof American leadership in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis, if the President were presented  with H.R. 4038, he would veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  September 27, 2016 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 954 \u2013 CO-OP Consumer Protection Act of 2016  \n(Rep. Smith, R-NE, and seven cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 954.  The Administration \nremains committed to providing Americans with accessible, quality, and affordable health \ncoverage, including by addressing issues that arise when their health insurers stop offering \ncoverage during the year.  In such circumstances, the Administration has offered special \nenrollment periods, provided consumer outreach, and worked with state departments of \ninsurance to ensure consumers have smooth transitions to other health plans.  Individuals for \nwhom coverage is unaffordable or who experience a hardship also may quality for an \nexemption from the individual-responsibility provision of the law.  These options are available \nto all consumers in these circumstances, not just those enrolled in coverage through CO-OPs. \n \nH.R. 954 would exempt anyone whose CO-OP ends coverage during the year from the \nindividual-responsibility provision.  This is unnecessary given consumer protections already \navailable.  Moreover, it would create a bad precedent for using exemptions from the \nindividual-responsibility provision to address unrelated concerns about the Affordable Care \nAct.  The individual-responsibility provision is a necessary part of a system that prohibits \ndiscrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions and requires guaranteed \nissuance.  The provision helps prevent people from waiting until they get sick to buy health \ninsurance or dropping health insurance when they believe they do not need it.  Weakening the \nindividual responsibility provision would increase health insurance premiums and decrease \nthe number of Americans with coverage. \n \nThe Administration always is willing to work with the Congress on fiscally responsible ways \nto further improve health care affordability and the Affordable Care Act.  The President's \nBudget offers a number of proposals to do so.  However, H.R. 954 would be a step in the \nwrong direction, because it would create a precedent that undermines a key part of the law and \nwould do nothing to help middle-class families obtain affordable health care.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 954, he would veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nJune 7, 2016 \n(Senate) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nS. 2943 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 \n(Sen. McCain, R-AZ) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee's continued support of \nour national defense and supports a number of provisions in S. 2943, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017.  The Administration also appreciates that \nS. 2943, as reported by the Committee, would authorize resources to support our troops in a \nmanner that is consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 without relying on budgetary \ngimmicks that risk the safety of our service members and undercut stable planning and efficient \nuse of taxpayer dollars.  Of particular note are provisions supporting the Administration's pay \nraise and force structure requests.  As the bill is considered by the Senate, it is critical that the \nCongress adhere to the principle that any increase in funding must be shared equally between \ndefense and non-defense \u2013 a central tenet of last fall's budget agreement. \n \nThe Administration strongly objects to many provisions in this bill that would hinder the \nDepartment of Defense's (DOD) ability to execute the President's defense strategy and the \nAdministration's ability to carry out national security and foreign policy.  Specifically, the bill \nattempts to micromanage DOD by impeding the Department's ability to respond to changing \ncircumstances, directing overly prescriptive organizational changes, preventing the closure of \nGuantanamo, and limiting U.S. engagement with Cuba, and includes provisions that set an \narbitrary limit on the size of the President's National Security Council staff.  The bill would \nundermine expert judgments of the Department's civilian and military leadership and constrain \nthe ability of the President and the Secretary of Defense to appropriately manage and direct the \nNation's defense.  \n \nReorganizing DOD without careful study and consideration would undermine the Department's \nability to continue to carry out its national security functions, and comes at a dangerous time, \nwith U.S. forces deployed across the globe, including as part of the Counter-ISIL campaign and \nNATO mission in Afghanistan.  S. 2943 would restructure key parts of DOD in ways that have \nnot been thoroughly reviewed by experts, either within or outside the Department, and that are \nlikely to make the Department less efficient and agile.  For example, it would dissolve the Office \nof the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD/AT&L) and replace it \nwith failed models of the past.  USD/AT&L has a track record of improved acquisition \nperformance for the taxpayer since the implementation of the Weapon Systems Acquisition \nReform Act of 2009 (WSARA) and the Better Buying Power initiatives of 2010 to the present.  \nThe bill would create dysfunctional partitions across DOD's research, engineering, procurement, \nand sustainment systems that will make it harder to sustain the Department's improved \nperformance.  The bill would reverse key aspects of WSARA, which reinforced early attention to \nrequirements, cost and schedule estimates, testing, and reliability.  The bill also would insert a \ncivilian, other than the President or the Secretary of Defense, into the administrative chain of \ncommand for the first time.  Simultaneously, it would direct the establishment of cross- functional entities, which in many cases already exist, but, if structured as the bill requires, \nwould undermine the authority of the Secretary, add bureaucracy, and confuse lines of \nresponsibility.   \n \nThe bill includes other troubling provisions affecting the Department.  For example, it would \nrigidly prescribe the use of a wide range of contracting methods in circumstances that history has \nproven are not appropriate or efficient in meeting the military's needs.  It would direct wholesale \nreorganization of military medical treatment facilities, which would jeopardize the readiness of \nmilitary healthcare providers to carry out wartime missions.  It would prescribe onerous, across-\nthe-board cuts to senior military billets, civilian executives, and contractors at a time when the \nDepartment is already undertaking a 25 percent cut to headquarters activities and other \nsignificant reforms to become leaner and more efficient.  The bill also would impair personnel \npolicies, such as parental leave and housing allowances, which are important to supporting the \nforce \u2013 particularly female service members.  These personnel changes would harm the \nDepartment's ability to recruit and retain the high-quality service members that our all-volunteer \nforce requires.  In addition, S. 2943 would impose unneeded costs, constraining DOD's ability to \nbalance military capability, capacity, and readiness, including by failing to authorize a new Base \nRealignment and Closure (BRAC) round. \n \nThe bill continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay and adds \nnew provisions, attempting to dictate how the Executive Branch conducts foreign policy and \nrequiring the disclosure of sensitive national security information.  The Administration also \nobjects to the inclusion of non-germane provisions, such as those exempting defense contractors \nfrom an Executive Order (EO) that ensures that agencies are identifying and working with \ncontractors with track records of compliance with labor laws.  These provisions have nothing to \ndo with the national security of our country, and decrease the economy and efficiency of the \nFederal procurement system.  Furthermore, the Administration strongly objects to efforts to limit \nour engagement with Cuba, curtailing the normalization of our relationship.  The Administration \nis also concerned that, in addition to lacking defense and non-defense parity, expected attempts \nto increase funding for defense accounts will fail to reflect the highest joint priorities of the \nDepartment, ensure programmatic stability and continuity and contribute to improvements in the \nreadiness of the joint force, rather than exacerbate readiness challenges.  \n \nIf the President were presented with S. 2943, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the \nbill.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below, and urges the Congress to work \nin a bipartisan fashion to make necessary changes to the bill.  The Administration also looks \nforward to reviewing the bill's classified annex and working with the Committee to address any \nconcerns on classified programs. \n \nGuantanamo Detainee Provisions:  The Administration strongly objects to several provisions of \nthe bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  As the Administration has \nsaid many times before, the continued operation of the facility weakens our national security by \ndraining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening \nviolent extremists.  In February, the Administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely \nand responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter \nof our history to a close.  Rather than taking the steps necessary to close the facility, this bill \n2  includes several provisions that would seek to extend its operation.  While some provisions \nrepresent an improvement over current law by authorizing additional flexibility in some \ncircumstances, the bill fails to eliminate the unwarranted limitations on the transfer of detainees, \nincluding the onerous restrictions that currently constrain the transfer of detainees to foreign \ncountries, and introduces additional problematic restrictions that would impede closure of the \nfacility.  \n \nAmong the onerous, unwarranted and harmful provisions, section 1029 would prohibit the \ntransfer of detainees to numerous countries on the basis of State Department travel warnings, \nwhich are designed for the unrelated purpose of conveying information to individual tourists and \nother travelers about potential dangers associated with travel to those countries.  These warnings \ndo not reflect a country's ability to mitigate potential risk with regard to transferred detainees or \nserve as an appropriate substitute for the Administration's careful and individualized assessment \nbased on all relevant facts and circumstances of the capability of potential receiving countries to \nsuccessfully reintegrate detainees and implement appropriate security measures.     \n \nIn addition, section 1027 would require the Secretary of Defense to provide to the Congress prior \nto any transfer a memorandum of understanding containing diplomatic assurances from the \nforeign nation to which the detainee would be transferred.  Across two administrations, the \nExecutive Branch has consistently informed the Congress and represented before U.S. courts that \ndisclosing such diplomatic assurances from foreign governments would reduce the willingness of \nthese and potentially other countries to cooperate with the United States on a range of matters.  \nSection 1027 would also require the disclosure of sensitive national security information not only \nto the Congress, but to the very nation that is the subject of the assessment.  Further, section \n1028 could require the Secretary of Defense to provide the Congress with classified, sensitive \nnational security information about detainees, in unclassified form.   \n \nThe President has objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation.  \nFurther, the provisions concerning detainee transfers could raise several constitutional concerns.  \nIn certain circumstances, sections 1021, 1026, 1027, and 1029 would violate constitutional \nseparation of powers principles.  Sections 1026 and 1029 could, in some circumstances, interfere \nwith the ability to transfer a detainee who has been granted a writ of habeas corpus.  And, as \nexplained, sections 1027 and 1028 could require the disclosure of privileged information.  The \nAdministration would treat these provisions consistent with the President's constitutional \nauthority in these areas. \n \nRestriction of the Size and Function of the National Security Council (NSC) Staff:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 1089, which would place an arbitrary limitation of 150 \nprofessional NSC staff, which assists the President by coordinating national security policy \nacross the many departments and agencies in the Executive branch.  By contrast, the combined \nstaff of the Senate Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Homeland Security, and Intelligence \nCommittees is larger than 150 people.  This provision would radically restructure the NSC staff, \nrequiring an arbitrary reduction in personnel that could inhibit the NSC staff's ability to advise \nand assist the President as he carries out his national security and foreign policy agenda in an \nincreasingly complicated world.  Indeed, the NSC staff includes a number of positions that were \nadded after a 2009 review recommended the creation of additional directorates and positions to \naddress emerging threats and challenges, such as cybersecurity and weapons of mass destruction-\nrelated terrorism.  Arbitrarily reducing the size of the NSC staff could impede the NSC staff's \nability to coordinate interagency policy and advise and assist the President on these important \n3  issues.  Moreover, this Administration has already actively sought to ensure appropriate NSC \nstaff levels, reducing the staff by 12 percent in the last eighteen months. \n \nElimination of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics \n(USD/AT&L):  The Administration strongly objects to section 901, which would eliminate the \nUSD/AT&L and assign its duties to multiple officials, including a new Under Secretary for \nResearch and Engineering, an Under Secretary for Management Support, and an Assistant \nSecretary for Acquisition Policy and Oversight.  Unlike the USD/AT&L, the new Under \nSecretary for Research and Engineering would not have responsibility for developmental testing, \nwhich provides critical feedback regarding the early identification of design problems that is \ncrucial for successful acquisition programs.  The new Under Secretary would not have \nresponsibility for contractor oversight and life-cycle sustainment costs, which would undermine \nDOD's ability to control contractor costs and oversee performance through the life of a program.  \nAnd the new Under Secretary would not have the authority to direct the military departments and \nDOD components, undermining the ability of the Secretary of Defense to provide guidance and \ndirection to the military services on major acquisition programs.  Finally, the assignment of \nlogistics oversight functions to both a new Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics \nand Sustainment under the new Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Policy and Oversight and a \nnew Under Secretary of Defense for Business Management would fracture and misalign logistics \nauthorities, management, and execution and ignore the key logistics authorities and policies \nrelated to deploying, sustaining, and retrograding forces in contingency operations.  Taken \ntogether, these changes would roll back the acquisition reforms of the last two decades and risk \nreturning the Department to an era in which overly optimistic cost estimates, inadequate system \nengineering and developmental testing, inappropriate reliance on immature technologies, \nineffective contractor management, and lack of focus on life-cycle costs by the military \ndepartments led to explosive cost growth and the failure of multiple major defense acquisition \nprograms.  It is particularly inappropriate for the Congress to do this now, when the data clearly \nshows that recent performance of the Department's acquisition system has improved markedly in \nrecent years.  For example, the proportion of major programs projecting funding savings below \nbaseline has risen from 29 percent to 57 percent in development, and 44 percent to 79 percent in \nunit procurement, between the 2009 and 2014 Selected Acquisition Reports.  Many of the \nreforms accomplished under WSARA and the Better Buying Power initiatives of 2010 to the \npresent would be overturned just as compelling evidence that they are succeeding has become \navailable. \n \nUndermining DOD Organization and Structure:  The Administration strongly objects to sections \n941 and 942, which would undermine the Secretary of Defense's ability to exercise authority, \ndirection, and control over the Department.  The provisions would blur lines of responsibility and \ncontrol over resources within the Department, and would require the issuance of numerous \nunnecessary and burdensome policies, directives, and reports.  Section 941 would undermine the \nSecretary's ability to create effective cross-functional teams, which are already an extremely \ncommon feature of the way the Department is organized today.  For example, the Joint \nRequirements Oversight Council, the Defense Acquisition Board, the 3-Star Programmers, the \nGlobal Posture Executive Council, and the Deputy's Management Action Group are all chartered \ncross-functional organizations at the heart of the Department's core functions.  These sections \nwould limit the Secretary's ability to use teams such as these by mandating an inflexible \nlegislative schedule for the establishment of such teams and requiring that the teams write their \nown charters.  Section 941 also would give directive authority over other elements of the \nDepartment and authorize them to requisition personnel and resources from other parts of the \n4  Department without regard to competing mission requirements.  Furthermore, by directing the \nDepartment to enter into contracts with outside consultants to obtain advice on the performance \nof the teams, this provision is squarely at odds with section 905, which would require \nconsiderable cuts to contractors in the Department.  Section 941 would also prohibit the \nnomination of an individual to a senior DOD position unless the individual has successfully \ncompleted a course in \"leadership, modern organizational practice, collaboration, and the \noperation of mission teams.\"  Sections 941 and 942 would require the Secretary to establish two \nseparate comprehensive organizational strategies with overlapping and not always consistent \nrequirements and different reporting requirements.  Contrary to the stated objective of the \nlegislation, these provisions would establish new processes and new paperwork burdens, \nresulting in increased bureaucracy and a larger, less efficient, and less responsive DOD \norganization.  \n \nOrganization of the Department of Defense for Management of Special Operations Forces and \nSpecial Operations:  The Administration objects to section 923, which would insert an Assistant \nSecretary into the administrative chain of command for the first time since the enactment of the \nNational Security Act of 1947, displacing the Service Secretaries.  This provision would also \namend the responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low \nIntensity Conflict to include assisting the Secretary and the Under Secretary of Defense for \nPolicy in the development and supervision of policy, program planning and execution, and \nallocation and use of resources for the activities of the Department for countering the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction (CWMD).  These CWMD responsibilities currently \nreside under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security.  \nFinally, this provision would intrude on the authority and the prerogative of the Under Secretary \nof Defense for Policy to manage the organization to provide the best support to the Secretary and \nthe President.  \n \nRealignment of Director of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E):  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 894, which would realign the Director of DT&E under the Director of \nOperational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E).  DT&E is part of the acquisition process and \nprovides insight into managing risks, measuring technical progress, and characterizing technical \nperformance during development.  Independent of the acquisition process, DOT&E provides an \nassessment that characterizes a weapons system's operational effectiveness, suitability, and \nsurvivability.  Therefore, DOT&E performs oversight that is singularly focused on testing, \nwithout regard for the fiscal and schedule realities of DOD acquisition. The realignment of \nDT&E under DOT&E would eliminate this separation, undermine a program manager's \nauthorities and responsibilities, and drive increases in program cost and schedule by severely \nimpacting the services' ability to plan and execute developmental test and evaluation strategies \nwithin the framework of the DOD acquisition process. \n \nU.S.-Cuba Military Engagement:  The Administration strongly objects to the additional \nrestrictions that would be placed on U.S.-Cuban military-to-military interactions.  The proposed \nrestriction would hamper pragmatic, expert-level coordination between the United States and \nCuba on issues that benefit the United States.  For example, the Commanding Officer of U.S. \nNaval Station Guantanamo Bay and his Cuban counterpart meet monthly to share information \nabout activities on both sides of the fence to reduce the risk of accidental escalation.  While \nsection 1204 carves out an exception for exercises and operations related to humanitarian \nassistance and disaster relief, it does not provide an exception or waiver for counter-narcotics.  In \naddition, section 1204 limits the ability of the Secretary of Defense to invite, assist, or assure the \n5  participation of the Government of Cuba in security conferences, where much of the multilateral \npreparatory work on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and counter-narcotics takes place.  \nIt is in the U.S. national security interest to maintain flexibility in U.S. military-to-military \nengagement with Cuba due to Cuba's proximity and the many shared challenges faced by the \nUnited States and Cuba. \n \nProhibition on Conducting Additional BRAC Round:   The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 2702 and strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so \nthat DOD can make better use of scarce resources.  Maintaining excess infrastructure is costly \nand wasteful, and it deprives the Department of the ability to reallocate scarce resources to \naddress readiness, modernization, and other national security requirements.   In addition to \naddressing every previous Congressional objection to BRAC authorization, the Department \nrecently conducted a DOD-wide parametric capacity analysis which demonstrated that the \nDepartment has 22 percent excess capacity.  Additionally, the Administration's BRAC legislative \nproposal includes several changes that respond to Congressional concerns regarding cost.  \nSpecifically, the revised BRAC legislation requires the Secretary to certify that BRAC will have \nthe primary objective of eliminating excess capacity and reducing costs; emphasizes \nrecommendations that yield net savings within five years (subject to military value); and limits \nrecommendations that take longer than 20 years to pay back.  The Administration strongly urges \nthe Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested. \n \nModification of National Missile Defense Policy:  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee's continued support for the Nation's ballistic missile defense programs.  However, the \nAdministration strongly objects to section 1665, which would amend section 2 of the National \nMissile Defense Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-38; 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2431) by striking \u2018limited.'  The \ninclusion of this word is specifically intended to convey that the U.S. homeland missile defense \nsystem is designed and deployed to counter limited attacks (in number and sophistication) from \nIran and North Korea, and not to counter the strategic deterrence forces of Russia and China.  \nThe Administration continues to believe that the most reliable and effective means to deter major \nnuclear powers from ever contemplating an attack on the United States is by maintaining a \nmodern and robust strategic nuclear deterrent force. \n \nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF):  The Administration strongly objects to the \nelimination of CTPF in section 4502, which would remove a valuable tool for partnership-\nfocused approaches to counterterrorism.  Cutting CTPF would greatly reduce the \nAdministration's flexibility to provide counterterrorism assistance to foreign partners.  The \nAdministration strongly encourages the Congress to authorize the $1 billion originally requested \nto continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2017.  \n \nTRICARE Reform:  The Administration greatly appreciates the Committee's meaningful \nTRICARE benefit reforms in sections 701 and 702, which closely resemble those included in the \nPresident's Budget.  However, the Administration is disappointed that the legislation does not \ninclude a modest enrollment fee for TRICARE for Life and phases in TRICARE Choice \nenrollment fees for non-Medicare eligible retirees over five years.  Together, these elements of \nthe Administration's proposal would provide nearly $2.6 billion in additional savings over a five \n-year period.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fully adopt the benefit reform \nprovisions submitted with the President's Budget.  The Administration is also very concerned \nabout section 726, which has the potential to cause serious program disruption and induce high \nadditional costs derived from the unintended consequence of further complicating health care \n6  contract acquisition processes to comply with its detailed legislative mandates.  The section \nwould include a provision on continuous competition, allowing \"automatic renewal\" of the \nmanaged care contracts for up to 10 years, but then would prohibit the incumbent from rebidding \non the successor contract.  It also would allow either party to terminate the contract with 180 \ndays' notice.  Either provision could result in large geographic areas losing their TRICARE \nmanaged care contracts, severely limiting beneficiary access to civilian care.  The multi-billion \ndollar TRICARE management contracts require substantial acquisition process time, compliance \nwith many statutory requirements, and robust transition periods between contractors.  As written, \nresponsible implementation of this section is not feasible. \n \nMilitary Health System Reform:  The Administration strongly objects to section 721, which \nwould radically restructure the military health system.  The language severs the relationship \nbetween each Service and its medical department, jeopardizing the ability of the Department to \nreadily provide operational medical support.  It also would separate the accountability for \nmedical support to military missions and the responsibility for the quality of care from \noperational missions.  Both functions are critically important to maintain the documented success \nin saving lives on the battlefield.  The Defense Health Agency is both a DOD entity and a \nCombat Support Agency; however, when working operational support issues, there is \nconsiderable difference between having an accountable leader with knowledge of the mission in \nthe Service chain of command versus a leader outside of that chain, as provided by section 721.  \nThe Department agrees that standardization of common clinical and business processes will lead \nto more effective and efficient care, and commits to substantially accelerating achievement of a \ncommon, enterprise approach consistent with the Services' operational readiness requirements. \nThe Department looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that the Military Health \nSystem provides state-of-the-art, quality care to all it serves, on and off the battlefield, while \nmaintaining critical readiness capability to support the military mission.  \n \nModifications to the Newly-Created Military Retirement System:  The Administration \nappreciates the flexibility provided by sections 631-633 in connection with retired pay reform \nand urges the Congress to support the use of continuation pay for service members with up to 16 \nyears of service, given varying retention rates across career fields and the military departments.  \nHowever, the Administration is concerned about mandating a 2.5 monthly basic pay multiplier \nfor continuation pay for all members.  Allowing DOD greater flexibility to adjust the timing and \namount of continuation pay would allow military services to shape the force more effectively and \nefficiently.  \n \nRestructure of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH):  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 604, which would undermine the existing structure of BAH, return the allowance to its \ndistorted state from the mid-1990s, and reinstitute a burdensome and inefficient administrative-\nauthorization process by limiting BAH payments to actual expenses.  It would also undermine \nthe structure by basing the allowance solely on grade and location (disregarding dependency \nstatus), and would inappropriately penalize some service members over others by linking their \nBAH payments to their status as members of dual-military couples (members married to other \nmembers).  Section 604 would disproportionately affect female service members and those \nmilitary families in which both military members have chosen to serve their country (20 percent \nof the women on active duty are in a dual-military marriage, compared with 3.8 percent of active \nduty men).  Both members of a dual-military couple would be provided a lesser compensation \npackage than other members of equal grade, sending a message that their service is not as highly \nvalued.  It would similarly penalize members who choose to share housing with other members \n7  and thus would inhibit the ability of junior service members to obtain suitable housing in tight \nrental markets, which is currently a recurring concern.  Also, section 604 would hurt the \nrecruitment and retention of high-quality service members and their families, making it difficult \nto sustain the all-volunteer force.  Finally, the changes would also impact benefits under multiple \nVA educational assistance programs that are based on BAH rates, potentially decreasing \npayment amounts, increasing the complexity of benefit calculations, and negatively impacting \nthe timeliness of benefit delivery. \n \nMilitary Leave:  The Administration objects to section 532, which would diminish the plenary \nauthority of the Secretary of Defense and undermine his ability to manage the force.  The \nAdministration urges the Congress to support DOD's military leave proposal, which strikes the \nright balance between parental benefits and sustaining readiness.  Additionally, the terms \n\"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregiver are used throughout the bill language without legislative \ndefinition.  Given the myriad family situations in the force, the Department does not believe that \nthese terms can be defined in a manner that creates a workable construct for implementing and \nadministering the provision.  \n \nHeadquarters Workforce Limitations:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 904 and \n905, which would impose new restrictions on the size of the civilian and contracted services \nworkforces for DOD headquarters.  In accordance with the requirements of section 346 of the FY \n2016 NDAA, DOD has re-baselined its major headquarters activities and put in place a \ncomprehensive plan to achieve a 25 percent reduction in the size of headquarters by FY 2020.  \nThe Department believes that the imposition of additional limitations on subcategories of \nheadquarters and the revival of old and inconsistent headquarters definitions would add \nunnecessary bureaucratic requirements, further complicate the mission of reducing headquarters, \nand reduce the Department's capacity to respond to emergent mission changes and requirements.  \nWith the ongoing reductions and the many other reform efforts the Department has undertaken \nsince 2008, we believe the Department's headquarters will be right-sized, given the tremendous \nbreadth and depth of the Department's mission.  Further cuts must be targeted, designed to \nreduce specific identified redundancies or inefficiencies, or come with commensurate reductions \nin the Department's mission.   \n \nReduction in General Officer and Flag Officer Grades and Positions:  While the Administration \nsupports simplifying and improving command and control of the military, particularly where the \nnumber of four-star positions have made headquarters either top-heavy or less efficient, it objects \nto section 501, which would arbitrarily reduce the number of general and flag officers by 25 \npercent by the end of calendar year 2017.  Reductions to the number of general and flag officer \npositions should be made deliberately after reviewing the role of each position and analyzing the \nimpact of the reduction on the force.  The Administration intends to reduce the number of four-\nstar positions and across-the-board mandated reductions would degrade the effectiveness and \nreadiness of the force.     \n \nLimitation on Number of Senior Executive Service (SES) Employees:  The Administration \nobjects to section 1112, which would make a mandatory, 25 percent across-the-board reduction \nin the number of the Department's SES employees by January 1, 2019.  The Administration \nsupports the elimination of unnecessary and excessive executive positions as evidenced by \nDOD's elimination of 97 SES positions in 2011, and a further reduction of over 140 SES \npositions since then.  However, any further reductions to SES positions in DOD should be made \nin a deliberate manner following a review and analysis of the impact of such reductions on the \n8  functioning of each component or agency.  Requiring DOD to arbitrarily cut additional SES \npositions across-the-board would create long-term negative impacts for various DOD services \nand organizations. \n \nCoalition Support Fund:  The Administration appreciates the extension of authority and funds \nassociated with section 1212(f) of the FY 2016 NDAA. \n \nPakistan Security Enhancement Authorization:  The Administration welcomes this authority to \nsupport security and stability in Pakistan, particularly in the Federally-Administered Tribal Areas \nand Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  However, the Administration objects to subsection (d) of section \n1214, which would make Pakistan ineligible for the Secretary of Defense's waiver authority \nunless the Secretary provides a certification to the congressional defense committees.  We share \nthe Committee's concerns regarding the threat posed to our forces and interests in Afghanistan by \nthe Haqqani Network, and we continue to engage with Pakistan at the highest levels regarding \nthe need for concerted action specifically against the group.  However, the restriction in \nsubsection (d) would unnecessarily complicate progress in our bilateral relationship on this issue \nand would limit the Secretary of Defense's ability to act in the U.S. national security interest.   \nSecurity Cooperation Enterprise Reforms:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \nefforts to reform DOD's security cooperation enterprise in subtitle G of Title XII, particularly \ncertain Administration requested reform proposals.  The bill also proposes far-reaching reforms \nin a number of areas to enhance the transparency and oversight of security sector resources, \nprofessionalize the workforce, and improve the alignment of authorities to defense strategy.  \nWhile these proposed reforms seek to address a number of existing challenges in the current \nframework, they go beyond the Administration's request with potentially broad ramifications that \nneed to be analyzed carefully.  Any reforms ultimately must ensure that no harm is done to \nDOD's current security cooperation and force readiness efforts, or to the State Department's lead \nrole in foreign policy and security sector assistance, including by inappropriately codifying, \nexpanding, limiting, or eliminating current authorities, resources, or mechanisms necessary to \nensure that the United States pursues a coherent and consistent foreign policy through all \nassistance activities.  In addition, this consolidation could undermine DOD's ability to support \nthe Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.   \nForeign policy and security cooperation authorities must continue to strike a balance between \nspecific defense initiatives and broader foreign policy priorities.  The bill's expansion of existing \nsecurity cooperation authorities must continue to preserve or include requested mechanisms for \nensuring State Department foreign policy direction, including joint formulation.  The \nAdministration is eager to work with the Committee, and with the Congress, to ensure the final \nlegislation undertakes Administration-requested reforms in a carefully considered manner that \navoids duplication of efforts and authorities, and unintended consequences for current DOD and \nState security sector assistance activities. \nProhibition on Use of Funds for Certain DOD Programs and Projects in Afghanistan that Cannot \nbe Safely Accessed by United States Government Personnel:  The Administration objects to the \nlanguage included in section 1213, which would adversely affect two key assistance programs -- \nthe Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) and the Commander's Emergency Response \nProgram (CERP).  DOD cannot predict or guarantee the future security environment in the \nvicinity of every program and project that is funded by CERP or ASFF, which are often used to \nfund multi-year programs and projects.  As a result, DOD would potentially be required to seek a \n9  waiver for every program and project -- a burdensome requirement that could negatively affect \nDOD's ability to address urgent needs of the local population, interrupt or slow down training \nand sustainment programs, and delay funding the critical needs of the Afghanistan National \nSecurity and Defense Forces at a time when insurgent forces are leveraging every opportunity to \nthreaten Afghanistan's security.  \n \nMultiple Provisions Imposing Restrictions on the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) \nProgram:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1036, 1037, 1038, and 1611.  Section \n1036 would restrict DOD's authority to use RD-180 engines, eliminate the Secretary's authority \nto waive restrictions to protect national security interests, and -- with section 1037 -- disqualify a \ndomestic launch service provider from offering a competitive, certified launch service capability.  \nSection 1038 would repeal the statutory requirement to allow all certified providers to compete \nfor launch service procurements.  Section 1611 would redirect funds away from the development \nof modern, cost-effective, domestic launch capabilities that will replace non-allied engines.  The \ncombined effect of these provisions would be to eliminate price-based competition of EELV \nlaunch service contracts starting in FY 2017, force the Department to allocate missions, inhibit \nDOD's ability to maintain assured access to space, delay the launch of national security satellites, \ndelay the on-ramp of new domestic launch capabilities and services, and increase the cost of \nspace launch to DOD, the Intelligence Community, and civil agencies. The authorization to use \nup to 18 RD-180 engines is necessary and prudent to expeditiously and affordably transition to \nthe new domestic launch capabilities currently under development.   \n \nTransition of Air Force Operation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to Enlisted Personnel:  \nThe Administration strongly objects to section 1046, which would require the Air Force to \ntransition all RPA operations to an organizational model that uses enlisted personnel for the \npreponderance of RPA operations by September 30, 2019.  Over the last decade, the demand for \nRPA forces has grown dramatically, and various factors have resulted in undesirable cuts in \ntraining capacity and ultimately reduced the number of trained aviators.  To address this issue, \nthe Air Force developed and is implementing a get-well plan that has begun correcting pilot \nshortfalls and increasing RPA pilot manning to achieve and sustain a healthy RPA enterprise.  \nBefore the Congress mandates any particular manning determinations, the Air Force should be \nallowed to conduct a study assessing the appropriate future balance of officer-enlisted \npilots/crews in the RPA enterprise and any potential impacts on future Air Force force structure.  \nDirecting a date and percentage for integrating enlisted pilots prior to understanding the \nramifications for training through-put and force management may negatively impact the entire \nRPA force and reduce combat capability at a time when it is beginning to create a healthy \nenterprise after years of continuous surge operations.  \n \nU.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) Assessment of Satellite Acquisition by National \nReconnaissance Office (NRO):  The Administration strongly objects to section 1606, which \nwould require the Comptroller General to continually assess the cost, schedule, and performance \nof NRO programs that receive funding from the Military Intelligence Program or are supported \nby DOD personnel.  Such an expansive definition would require annual audits of all NRO \nprograms, not just those funded in part by DOD.  This additional oversight would be \nexceptionally burdensome and unnecessarily wasteful to an agency that has received seven \nconsecutive clean financial audits and was recently recognized by the Congress for its systems \nacquisitions excellence.  The current oversight regime is sufficient and appropriate, and includes \nthe NRO Inspector General, DOD, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the \nInspectors General of those agencies, the Office of Management and Budget, and the \n10  Congress.  Since 2011, GAO access has been administered by Intelligence Community Directive \n114, which reflects an agreement between the Comptroller General and the Director of National \nIntelligence.  Given the sensitivity of NRO acquisitions, extensive GAO access would present \nsecurity risks to the Nation's most sensitive space programs. \n \nLimitation on Acceleration of Dismantlement of Retired Nuclear Weapons:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 3113, which would place unnecessary restrictions on the ability of the \nPresident to exercise his responsibilities to manage the nuclear arsenal.  The Administration also \nobjects to the reduction in funding for accelerated dismantlement of retired nuclear warheads.  \nThe United States has a considerable backlog of retired warheads awaiting dismantlement that \nare no longer needed for military purposes.  Funding for accelerated dismantlement is important \nboth to appropriately manage the U.S. nuclear arsenal in a safe, secure, and effective way and to \ndemonstrate continued U.S. commitment to nonproliferation and disarmament. \n \nNonproliferation Construction:  The Administration strongly objects to continued construction of \nthe Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility and to section 3114 which would require yet \nanother study of the cost and time necessary to complete this facility.  Even with a firm fixed-\nprice contract for the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility, numerous previous studies have confirmed \nthat the alternative disposition method is expected to be significantly faster and less \nexpensive.  Consistently, these reviews have concluded that the projected life-cycle costs of the \nMOX fuel approach for plutonium disposition will be $30-$50 billion, and possibly higher, and \nwill require approximately $800 million to $1 billion annually for decades through the life of the \nprogram.  It would be irresponsible for the Congress to require continued construction of this \nproject, which would only serve to waste limited national security funds and force more pressing \nnuclear security needs to go unmet.  The already-proven alternative method of disposition is \nexpected to be significantly faster and less expensive than the MOX approach, has far lower \nrisks, and will begin to move plutonium out of the State of South Carolina much sooner. \n \nThe Administration also objects to section 3114, which would establish the Chief of Engineers as \nan owner's agent relative to the MOX Project.  Recognizing the U.S. Army Corps' (USACE) \nexpertise, the Department of Energy is already leveraging USACE personnel on its large \nconstruction projects, including the MOX Project where USACE is augmenting project oversight \nand providing independent cost estimates.  Therefore, the Administration does not believe \nnaming USACE as the owner's agent will provide additional value. \n \nProviding Footwear to Recruits at Initial Entry Training:  The Administration objects to section \n671, which would require the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to provide athletic \nfootwear directly to recruits upon their entry into the Armed Forces instead of providing a cash \nallowance for the purchase of such footwear, at the choice of the recruit.  Mandating that a \nspecific article of clothing be provided to new recruits is unprecedented and, in the case of \nathletic shoes, runs counter to research that indicates a strong correlation between the variety of \nathletic shoes available, fit, and comfort, and reduced injury rates.  Forcing DOD into a \"one size \nfits all\" approach to athletic footwear may contribute to a higher incidence of injury to new \nrecruits during one of the most critical times in a member's military training.  DOD places the \nhealth of service members above all other considerations.  Because only one company is \ncurrently producing a shoe that arguably meets the standards established in the section, this \nprovision appears to provide a preferential arrangement for a particular company.   \n \n11  Distributed Common Ground System of the Army (DCGS-A):  The Administration objects to \nsection 111, which would restrict award of any contract for the design, development, and \nprocurement of any data architecture, data integration, cloud capability, data analysis or data \nvisualization and workflow capabilities unless Federal Acquisition Regulation part 12 is used,  \nincludes firm fixed-priced procedures, and achieves initial operational capability within nine \nmonths and full operational capability within 18 months of contract award.  This provision \nappears to micromanage and mandates a commercial solution without regard for price, ability to \nsupport a modular open system architecture, or cost associated with proprietary software \nmaintenance.  In practice, the provision could mandate acquisition of a system that does not fully \nmeet required Key Performance Parameters without due consideration of integration costs and \nrisks or schedule impacts, putting the system's affordability, functionality, and interoperability at \nrisk.  \n \nWarfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T):  The Administration strongly objects to the \nfunding authorization that reduces WIN-T by $100 million.  The reduction in funds stops the \nfielding of the WIN-T on-the-move networking capability to Army National Guard Brigade \nCombat Teams and creates a production break in WIN-T Increment 2 hardware.  The production \nbreak will lead to the loss of key subject matter experts.  \n \nCommissary Privatization Pilot Program:  The Administration supports section 661, which \nwould include provisions that would protect and enhance the Defense commissary and exchange \nsystems and reduce their reliance on appropriated fund support by allowing the establishment of \nan alternative pricing program for commissaries.  However, the Administration has concerns \nwith the commissary privatization pilot program directed in section 662.  The Department \nrecently issued a Request for Information (RFI), in accordance with the requirements of the FY \n2016 NDAA, and will not be able to assess the willingness of private sector entities to participate \nin a privatization pilot program in a manner consistent with the preservation of the commissary \nbenefit until responses to the RFI have been received and assessed.  By requiring the Department \nto conduct a pilot program for privatization regardless of the interest and capabilities of private \nsector entities, section 662 would place the commissary benefit at risk.   \n \nEstablishment of an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Information:  The Administration objects \nto section 903, which would establish an Assistant Secretary for Information whose \nresponsibilities would be potentially duplicative with the Principal Cyber Advisor (PCA) to the \nSecretary of Defense as well as the Principal Space Advisor.  While it would combine oversight \nof cyber policy and information technology, it would complicate, rather than improve, the \noversight of U.S. Cyber Command and cyber operations, or U.S. Strategic Command and space \noperations, with governance of resources, acquisition, and cyber workforce policy fragmented.  It \nalso would create a new fracture in DOD and intelligence space management between the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Intelligence and the new Assistant Secretary, and potentially distract \nfrom the current Chief Information Officer's position and responsibilities.  \n \nManagement of Defense Clandestine Human Intelligence Collection:  The Administration \nobjects to section 945, which purports to establish a pilot program that would place case officers \nof the Defense Clandestine Service (DCS) under the control of the Central Intelligence Agency \n(CIA).  Requiring the transfer of all case officers and personnel who support case officers of the \nDCS to the CIA for three years is not a \"pilot,\" but is tantamount to an actual transfer of the \nprogram.  Limiting the transfer to three years would not mitigate the burdensome management \nchallenges, disruption of operations, and potentially high costs associated with moving the \n12  operating capability of the service to the CIA and then returning it back to DOD.  Further, the \nAdministration is concerned that there could be adverse and unforeseen implications of such a \ntransfer to the professional development of DCS staff.  DCS and CIA integrated operations are \nalready working effectively and efficiently; a consolidation, as envisioned by the provision, is \nunnecessary.  For example, the DCS and CIA already exchange or embed personnel for \nplanning, management, coordination, execution of operations, and development and sharing of \nproducts.   The DCS is already integrated with the CIA, as necessary and appropriate, throughout \nthe breadth and depth of DOD and CIA clandestine operations around the world.  \n \nB-21 (Long Range Strike Bomber):  The Administration strongly objects to section 844, which \nwould establish a critical cost threshold for the B-21 program below the acquisition program \nbaseline (APB), which was based on two fully independent cost estimates.  This section \nrepresents an unprecedented and extremely damaging reversal of the approved acquisition \nstrategy for the B-21 program.  To enforce a different performance standard after the execution \nof the acquisition strategy has begun will result in the carefully established business plan \nbecoming mired in reporting delays and unprecedented, redundant breach certifications.  The \nAdministration also strongly objects to the $302.3 million FY 2017 funding reduction.  There are \nno excess funds in the program in FY 2017 and the reduction will result in a significant delay in \nmoving forward with the development program.  Furthermore, the Administration believes that \nthe requirement to transfer funds to the Rapid Prototyping Fund could jeopardize the program \nthrough increased risk to the availability of funds, and the additional reporting requirements \nwould be unnecessarily burdensome, would add schedule risk, and would detract from overall \nprogram management at a critical phase of the program.   \n \nPenalty for Use of Cost-Type Contracts/Preference for Fixed-Price Contracts:  The \nAdministration objects to section 826, which would require the Secretary of each military \ndepartment and the head of each of the defense agencies to pay a penalty for some uses of cost-\ntype contracts that are awarded over the next five fiscal years.  Section 826 would unnecessarily \nconstrain flexibility to tailor contract types for a given requirement.  It also creates a complex \nfinancial transaction process that, to be auditable, will require extremely burdensome procedures.  \nThe Administration also objects to section 827, which would require higher level approval for \nthe use of other than fixed-price contracts.  This requirement is unnecessary and would result in \nthe Department experiencing increased costs in situations where a cost-type contract would have \nbeen more appropriate.  Acquisition officials and contracting officers should have the full range \nof contract types available to structure business arrangements that achieve a reasonable balance \nof risk between the Government and the contractor, while providing the contractor with the \ngreatest incentive for efficient and economical performance.  There is extensive history that \ndemonstrates conclusively that fixed-price development is not in the Government or industry's \ninterest in many circumstances. \n \nGlobal Positioning System Next Generation Operation Control System (GPS-OCX):  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 1610, which would withhold FY 2017 OCX funding \nuntil a Nunn-McCurdy certification is complete.  OCX will provide a cyber-hardened ground \ncontrol network to operate the current and future GPS satellites.  Fencing off FY 2017 OCX \nfunding will result in a stop-work for the development, test, and integration of OCX Block 0 and \nBlock 1, resulting in a 6-12 month slip to the launch and operation of GPS III.  Additionally, the \nprovision de-funds ongoing efforts to synchronize and modernize the GPS Enterprise, resulting \nin cost and schedule impacts across the space, mission control/planning, and user segments, and \n13  it stops all user equipment testing, preventing the deployment of M-code capable receivers as \nrequired in Public Law 111-383, section 913.   \n \nNon-applicability of EO 13673 to DOD Contractors:  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 829H, which would limit DOD's application of EO 13673 (\"Fair Pay and Safe \nWorkplaces\") only to contractors or subcontractors who have already been suspended or \ndebarred as a result of Federal labor violations covered by the EO.  Such limited applicability \nwould undermine broader safeguards established by the President to ensure that agencies are \nidentifying and working with contractors with track records of compliance with labor laws, \nwhich enhances productivity and increases the likelihood of timely, predictable, and satisfactory \ndelivery of goods and services.  Narrowing the scope of the EO to those contractors that have \nalready been suspended or debarred would limit contracting officers' ability to identify \ncontractors with track records of non-compliance.  It also would limit enforcement agencies' \nability to assist contractors with significant labor violations to improve their labor law \ncompliance, including through the use of labor compliance agreements, before suspension and \ndebarment becomes the only option.   \n \nApplicability of Certain Executive Orders to DOD:  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 862, which would weaken a number of EOs and other actions taken by the President to \nprotect taxpayer money and the integrity of the acquisition process and to improve the economy \nand efficiency of Federal contracting.  For example, the President's Memorandum on Contractor \nTax Delinquency laid the foundation for limiting agencies' ability to make new awards to \ncontractors with serious tax delinquencies.  These protections are no less relevant in the case of \nFederal contractors furnishing commercially-available off-the-shelf items.  Section 862 also \nundermines other EOs such as EO 13665 that protect against discrimination in Federal \ncontractors' workplaces.  Discriminatory hiring and compensation practices decrease the \nlikelihood that the most qualified and productive workers are hired at the market efficient price, \nand hence broad applicability is required to ensure an efficient market in Federal contracting.  \nThe remainder of EOs that section 862 seeks to weaken -- including those encouraging the use of \nProject Labor Agreements requiring that employees be notified of their statutory labor rights, as \nwell as raising the minimum wage and providing paid sick leave for Federal contract employees \n-- similarly improve productivity of Federal contractors' workplaces.  As such, section 862 \nshould be struck as it would decrease the economy and efficiency of the Federal procurement \nsystem. \n \nPersonnel Background and Security Investigations:  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 973, which would transfer responsibility for personnel background and security \ninvestigations of DOD personnel from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to the \nDefense Security Service.  This provision would undermine the ability of the Federal \nGovernment to achieve economies of scale by further fragmenting the investigation process \nwhile diminishing the security, effectiveness, and efficiency of operations.  The Administration \nis currently standing up the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), which will \nstrengthen how the Government performs background investigations.  NBIB will be housed at \nOPM to conduct the vast majority of background investigations, but will leverage DOD expertise \nto bring the fullest national security and IT resources to bear against increasingly sophisticated \ncyber threats.  Section 973 would upend this plan and interfere with the Executive Branch's \nability to determine appropriate means for implementing this critical national security function.  \nIt would also delay ongoing security clearance reform efforts, and likely cause significant \ninvestigative delays. \n14   \nExpansion of DOD Hiring Flexibilities:  The Administration supports the inclusion of section \n1106 (Direct Hire for post-secondary students and recent graduates), and section 1103 \n(temporary and term appointments), which would increase the ability of DOD to recruit and hire \nthe talent it needs to carry out critical mission areas.  We urge the Congress to broaden these \nprovisions to include other Federal agencies under Title 5 of the United States Code.  Hiring and \nrecruitment flexibilities provided in these provisions would be extremely valuable for all Federal \nagencies, and would enable Government-wide improvements to help meet Federal workforce \nneeds. \n \nProgram Acquisition and Contracting Restrictions:  The Administration  objects to section 145, \nwhich would prohibit the Department from using authorized funds to re-host the COMPASS \nCALL Primary Mission Equipment from the EC-130H to a commercial business jet without \nconducting a full and open competition.  The Air Force requires the flexibility to employ \nappropriate contracting authorities as allowed by law, including the exemptions to full and open \ncompetition in order to efficiently and effectively execute the COMPASS CALL re-host plan.  If \nthe Air Force determines that less than full and open competition is allowable and advisable, \nconducting a full and open competition will unnecessarily delay fielding critical warfighter \ncapability.  The Administration also objects to section 146, which would restrict the Department \nfrom obligating or expending funds on the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System \nrecapitalization program, unless the Air Force uses a fixed-price contract for engineering and \nmanufacturing development.  The restriction places unacceptable risk on the program by \nrestricting the Department's ability to use a contract type which is best suited for the \ndevelopment effort. \n \nF-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1086 and \n1087, which would disband the F-35 Joint Program Office following the F-35 full-rate \nproduction decision (expected in April 2019), and establish the F-35 Follow-on Modernization \nprogram as a separate major defense acquisition program.  The contention that the F-35A, F-\n35B, and F-35C are essentially three distinct aircraft with significantly different missions and \ncapability requirements misses the mark and does not take into account the essential role that the \nF-35 Joint Program Office plays in the program, or the international nature of the program and \nthe role that the international partners will continue to play for the remainder of this, the most \ncomplex cooperative weapons program DOD has ever undertaken.  The follow-on modernization \neffort, which is just beginning, and the challenging transition from development to global \nsustainment and life-cycle support require continued management of the enterprise from a central \nJoint Program Office.  While a transition to individual, Service-led, F-35 variant program offices \nmight conceivably be advantageous at some time, now is not that time, and retaining the current \nprogram structure for the Follow-on Modernization program, with its existing oversight \nmechanisms, is the most prudent approach.   \n \nMissile Defense Programs:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1663, which would \nrequire the initiation of concept definition, design, research, development, and engineering \nevaluation and test for a space-based intercept and defeat layer and space test bed.  There \ncurrently is no requirement for a space-based intercept and there are concerns about the technical \nfeasibility and long-term affordability of interceptors in space.  The Department is conducting an \nevaluation on a space-based missile defense layer, as required by section 1685 of the FY 2016 \nNDAA.  The results of that evaluation will inform the technical feasibility of such a capability.  \n \n15  Defense Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Board:  The Administration objects to the provision \nin section 811, which would create a new Defense-specific CAS Board to create standards \naddressing the measurement, assignment, and allocation of contractor costs.  This action would \nresult in unnecessary overlap and duplication with the functions of the existing Government-\nwide CAS Board and could result in contractors with both Defense and civilian contracts having \nto comply with two different standards for the same cost issue.  Requiring the use of generally \naccepted accounting principles (GAAP) would impose inappropriate constraints on the Board's \nability to carry out its responsibilities.  GAAP focuses on reporting the financial results of overall \noperations, and addresses neither the allocation of costs to individual contracts nor the \nallowability of contract costs.  Section 811 also imposes inappropriate limitations on the Defense \nContract Audit Agency (DCAA) despite its historical success in savings on average of $3 billion \nannually due to findings, primarily those related to non-compliances with CAS and the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation Cost Principles.  Commercial audit firms would audit GAAP costs, while \nDCAA would be limited to audits of direct costs on cost contracts and to audits of indirect costs \nonly at contractors where their Government cost-type contracts are more than 50 percent of the \nentities' total sales.  This would exclude some of DOD's largest contract from DCAA oversight.  \nAudits by both DCAA and commercial audit firms would create burdens and inefficiencies for \nboth contractors and Government agencies. \n \nModified Restrictions on Undefinitized Contractual Actions (UCAs):  The Administration \nobjects to section 816, which would require that UCAs be awarded on a fixed-price level of \neffort basis.  Fixed-price level of effort is a contract type that is most appropriately used to \nacquire labor, as in the case of research or investigatory requirements.  The Department employs \nUCAs largely in part to enable the contractor to acquire materials (e.g. long lead) for major \nweapon system programs, something this provision would seem to prohibit. UCAs are also used \nwhen the urgency of a Government need argues strongly against the negotiations delay caused by \nestablishing final terms.  \n \nRequirement to Use Firm Fixed-Price Contracts for Foreign Military Sales (FMS):  The \nAdministration objects to section 828, which restricts the contract type for FMS.  Frequently, \nDOD combines requirements with FMS requirements on a single contract, or has contractors \nconcurrently producing weapon systems for its requirements and FMS requirements under \nseparate contracts.  If the Department were precluded from using the appropriate type contract in \nany particular environment, it would effectively constrain DOD's ability to deliver best value to \nthe FMS customer, and eliminate opportunities to achieve efficiencies by combining U.S. and \nFMS requirements on the same contract.   \n \nPreference for Performance-Based Contractual Payments:  The Administration objects to the \nprovision of section 829 that would preclude DOD from conditioning performance-based \npayments on costs incurred.  Performance-based payments are a method of contract financing \nand should not be used to pay contractors amounts in excess of costs incurred in advance of the \nGovernment's receipt of the item or service.   \n \nProducts and Services Purchased through Contracting Program for Firms that Hired the Severely \nDisabled:  The Administration strongly objects to section 829G, which would jeopardize \napproximately 33,000 existing jobs that DOD provides to people with severe disabilities, to \ninclude 2,800 veterans.  Furthermore, this provision would effectively preclude the Department \nfrom awarding near-term contracts to enable opportunities for future employment for countless \nothers with severe disabilities.  The Department is by far the largest single procurer of goods and \n16  services from Ability One within the Federal Government.  The provision would require DOD to \nperform several statutory duties that are currently performed by the Committee for Purchase \nFrom People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, the Federal agency that administers the \nAbility One Program.  For example, section 829G would require DOD contracting officers to \ndetermine when a firm's (nonprofit agency) employee is significantly disabled and ensure their \nhours equate to the 75 percent Direct Labor Hour (DLH) ratio in this section.  Current law \nrequires the 75 percent DLH ratio to be calculated based on all DLH in the firm's entire facility \nduring the fiscal year.  Additionally, there would be no mechanism available to legally add \nproducts or services to the Procurement List, restricting contracting with non-profits that employ \npeople with severe disabilities to those items that are currently on the List.  There is no practical \nway for the Department's contracting officers to meet the pre-contract formation and post-\ncontract administration requirements of section 829G and would therefore bring these contracts \nand renewals to a standstill along with the employment opportunities that these contracts \nprovide.   \n \nDefense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS):  The Administration objects to language in \nsection 901, which would move DFAS from the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to the \nUnder Secretary of Defense (Business Management and Support) organization.  DFAS performs \nimportant financial management and pay functions that are and should remain under the purview \nof the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).  This action would remove core financial management \nfunctions, including payment of the Department's vendors, cash management, and financial audit \nsupport from the supervision of the CFO and sever critical links between DFAS and the CFO \nwith respect to management of the Department's funding and audit functions.  A crucial \ningredient to all the Services achieving unqualified financial audit opinions is the role DFAS \nplays as a service provider.  As the DOD focal point for audit, the CFO's centralized control of \nthe service provider and the audit plan ensures all are vectored properly. \n \nJoint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF):  The Administration objects to \nsection 1531, which fails to address the successor fund to the JIEDDF mandated by the FY 2016 \nNDAA.  Without the authorization of the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund, the successor \nfund proposed by DOD, the Administration is constrained in its ability to enable rapid response \nto non-traditional, unanticipated improvised threats on the battlefield, degrade improvised \nexplosive device precursor facilitation networks of ISIL and other violent non-state actors \nglobally, and protect against the rapidly emerging improvised threats currently faced by U.S. \nforces. \n \nPreference for Commercial Services:  The Administration objects to the provision of section 864 \nthat would preclude agencies from acquiring certain services unless they are commercial \nservices, except where the agency makes a written determination establishing that no commercial \nservices are suitable to meet the agency's needs.  The range of applicable services has been \nsignificantly expanded beyond the information technology services specified in section 855 of \nthe FY 2016 NDAA to include broad service categories such as logistics management services.  \nBecause cost-type contracts cannot be used for the acquisition of commercial items, this \nexpansion would unnecessarily and inappropriately limit the Department's ability to execute \ncontracts using the most appropriate contract type.  For example, even though planned logistics \nsupport services for the Joint Strike Fighter are optimally suited for a cost-type contract, the \nDepartment would be precluded from using a cost-type contract as long as the services were \navailable commercially.  \n \n17  Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Reform:  The Administration appreciates that the bill \nadopts a number of the UCMJ reforms proposed by the Administration, including enhanced \nvictims' rights (including anti-retaliatory measures), improvements to trial procedures, and \nupdated sentencing guidelines. \n \nNational Defense Strategy:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1096, which would \nrequire DOD to publish a new national defense strategy annually.  A national defense strategy \nmust provide strategic direction, priorities, and tradeoffs to address both near and longer-term \nchallenges.  If a document is truly strategic, its shelf-life will be far longer than one year.  A new \nstrategy takes time to integrate within and usefully impact the Department's many operational, \nbudgetary, scenario, and other assessments, processes, and systems.  DOD continually assesses \nand regularly adjusts its strategy; however, formal annual assessments would create substantial \nadministrative burden and discordant direction that degrades the effectiveness and efficiency. \n \nAuthority to Provide Reimbursable Auditing Services to Certain Non-Defense Agencies:  The \nAdministration appreciates the modification to section 893 of the FY 2016 NDAA in section 892 \nof the bill.  However, the Administration recommends that section 892 repeal section 893(a) of \nthe FY 2016 NDAA, rather than amending section 893(a).  The prohibition on DCAA \nperforming audits for non-defense agencies is counterproductive to the intent to reduce DCAA's \nincurred cost inventory backlog.  It would extend the length of time required to reduce the audit \nbacklog and create burdens and inefficiencies in the audit process for both contractors and \nmultiple Government agencies. \n  \nTransfer of the DCAA:  The Administration strongly objects to the language in section 901 that \nwould place DCAA under the Under Secretary of Defense (Management and Support).  GAO \npreviously concluded that audit independence would be impaired if DCAA was aligned with \neither the USD/AT&L or the Office of the Inspector General.  Alignment under the Under \nSecretary of Defense (Management and Support) would impair DCAA's ability to perform \nindependent audits.  This would reduce DCAA's independence because it would locate DCAA \nwithin the organization responsible for acquisition and contract administration. \n \nAsia-Pacific Rebalance Infrastructure:  The Administration strongly objects to the exclusion of \nrequested language which would authorize DOD to proceed with planning, design and \nconstruction for public infrastructure projects identified as necessary mitigation for several \nsignificant impacts identified in the Navy's 2015 \"Guam and Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands Military Relocation (2012 Roadmap Adjustments) Supplemental Environmental \nImpact Statement\" and Record of Decision.  The cultural repository and public health laboratory \nare critical projects required to address the impact of the expanding military installations and \nmissions on Guam necessary to implement the Asia-Pacific rebalance.  A key aspect of the Asia-\nPacific rebalance is to create a more operationally resilient Marine Corps presence in the Pacific \nand invest in Guam as a joint strategic hub.  This necessary authority supports the ability of the \nPresident to execute our foreign and defense policies in coordination with our ally, Japan.  \nAdditionally, it calls into question among regional states our commitment to implement the \nrealignment plan and our ability to execute our defense strategy. \n \nTransfer of Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Funding:  The Administration strongly objects to \nthe section 4501 Other Authorizations transfer of $258.3 million from Drug Interdiction and \nCounter Drug Activities account to the unrequested Security Cooperation Enhancement Fund.  \nThe transfer of these funds would severely hinder DOD's drug interdiction and counter-drug \n18  efforts at a time when drug trafficking to the United States is increasing.  Estimates of opium \npoppy cultivation in Mexico nearly tripled from 2013-2015 and over 90 percent of the heroin \nproduced in Mexico is trafficked to the United States.  The rate of overdose deaths involving \nheroin have tripled in the past three years.  Colombia's estimated potential cocaine production \nincreased by 67 percent since 2014 and is now at an eight year high.  It is critically important that \nDOD continue to provide targeted and focused counterdrug training, equipment, and other \nassistance to meet the President's objectives under the National Drug Control Strategy goals, \nwhile supporting national strategies that aim to enhance security in Colombia, Mexico, and \nCentral America, and protect U.S. public health and safety.  The new Fund also raises other \nconcerns.    \n \nIncrease of Micro-purchase Threshold, Simplification of Proposal Development and Evaluation, \nand Acquisition of Innovative Commercial Items:  The Administration strongly supports the \nCommittee's efforts to reduce the complexity of the acquisition process and believes that sections \n812 and 815 should be broadened to ensure the entire Federal Government has the necessary \ntools to acquire best value solutions and bring even greater savings to the taxpayer.  Section 812 \nwould reduce unnecessary complexity of small dollar acquisitions by raising the micro-purchase \nthreshold.  Civilian agencies should be able to receive these benefits and the Administration \nsupports increasing these benefits by including civilian agencies and raising the threshold even \ngreater to $10,000.  Section 815 would simplify proposal requirements for certain services under \nMultiple Award task order contracts.  The Administration estimates that multi-agency contracts \nor Government-wide acquisition vehicles account for approximately half of all service contract \ndollars awarded each year.  To receive the greatest benefit of this section and create parity \namong acquisition vehicles, the Administration supports expanding this provision to all multi-\nagency contracts or Government-wide acquisition vehicles including the Federal Supply \nSchedules.  The Administration also appreciates inclusion of section 868 which would provide \npilot authority for the Department to acquire, on a pilot basis, innovative commercial items in the \nsame manner as it acquires research and development, but urges the Congress to broaden the \npilot to include the Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration \nso that they too may take advantage of the pilot to obtain emerging technologies more efficiently. \n \nRepeal of Moratorium on Public-Private Competition:  The Administration objects to section \n806, which would eliminate the moratorium on public-private competition between Government \nemployees and private sector contractors to perform commercial activities that support DOD \nmissions.  OMB continues to work with DOD and other agencies on efforts to ensure the most \neffective mix of Federal employees and contractors and believes more time is needed for efforts \nto ensure core in-house capabilities for critical functions before the moratorium is lifted.   \n \nBoard for the Correction of Military Records and Discharge Review Board Matters:  The \nAdministration objects to the overly-burdensome and duplicative reporting requirements in \nsection 536.  The Department has exercised extraordinary commitment to service members and \nveterans through extensive reforms to the military department's Review Boards' policies and \nprocedures.  These reforms include, but are not limited to, the inclusion of mental health \nprofessionals in all aspects of Discharge Review Board and Board for Correction of Military and \nNaval Records procedures, as well as highly-specialized procedures relative to cases in which \npetitioners alleged Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and/or Traumatic Brain Injury as factors in \ndeterminations regarding their service records.  These procedures have been highly effective in \naddressing petitions asserting such bases and the Boards have performed and continue to perform \ntheir missions in open and transparent fashion, including the publication of redacted decisions in \n19  public reading rooms.  The proposed reporting requirements, however, would not only require \nsubstantial, additional assets and take significant time, compromising the Boards' ability to \naccomplish their missions and provide equitable relief to deserving service members and \nveterans, but will also expose significant sensitive information and potentially Personally \nIdentifying Information.  The proposal would also mandate the revelation of factors both \nconsidered and not considered in each case.  Such a requirement impinges on the Boards' ability \nto fashion appropriate remedies in highly individualized cases and also requires the creation \nand/or revelation of a template seemingly applicable in every case.  Such an approach not only \nthreatens the required autonomy of the Boards, but also creates a \"checklist\" approach belying \nthe importance of discretion and consideration of each and every case on its merits while also \ncreating the harmful practice of precedence in Board cases. \n \nNotification on the Provision of Defense Sensitive Support:  The Administration objects to \nsection 1052, which would levy an unnecessary and burdensome reporting and notification \nrequirement on the Department regarding sensitive support to agencies outside DOD.  The \nexisting clandestine quarterly reports keeps the Congress fully informed of the Defense Sensitive \nSupport Activity (DSSA) process and each approved request for support.  Introducing an \nadditional requirement for prior notification of each instance of requested support is \nfundamentally impractical given their frequency, risks slowing or interrupting providing critical \nand timely support for operations, and burdens limited staff with duplicative reporting \nrequirements in a time of declining resources, staff the Department relies upon to do the effective \noversight and execution of the DSSA process that the Congress and supported organizations \nexpect. \n \nAssociate Director for Military Affairs:  The Administration objects to section 1049, which \nwould specify criteria and responsibilities of an Associate Director for Military Affairs at the \nCIA, because it is unnecessary and duplicative.  Existing policies, regulations, and interagency \nagreements already provide for an Associate Director for Military Affairs. \n \nTransfer of Military-Grade Firearms to Private Companies:  The Administration objects to \nsection 1056, which could put the U.S. Army in the position of transferring certain military-\ngrade firearms to dealers in the United States -- the kinds of transfers that are highly regulated \nunder existing law -- and potentially make it more difficult for those weapons to be traced if later \nused in crimes.   \n \nSpecial Immigrant Visas:  The Administration is deeply concerned that this legislation does not \nextend or authorize new visas as requested for the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program, \nwhich enables Afghans who have worked alongside our troops and our diplomats to seek refuge \nin the United States.  Thousands of Afghans have performed this work, often at great personal \nrisk.  Many have even lost their lives.  Many continue to face grave threats.  These Afghan \ncivilians have been essential to accomplishing our mission in Afghanistan.   \n \nUse of Surplus Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Motors for Commercial Space \nLaunches:  Section 1607 would direct the Comptroller General to conduct an analysis of the \ncosts and benefits of providing surplus ICBMs to the private sector for commercial space launch \npurposes.  Both Federal law and the Administration's National Space Transportation Policy \ncurrently prohibit such transfers for commercial use.  The Administration continues to support \nthis long-standing policy, which seeks to avoid undermining investment, entrepreneurship, and \ninnovation in the launch market. \n \n20  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n21  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nJanuary 5, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 712 \u2013 Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Collins, R-GA, and 22 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they \nare tailored to advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that \nthey minimize uncertainty.  H.R. 712 would undermine critical public health and safety \nprotections, introduce needless complexity and uncertainty in agency decision-making, and \ninterfere with agency performance of statutory mandates.  Accordingly, the Administration \nstrongly opposes House passage of H.R. 712.  \n \nH.R. 712 would impose unnecessary procedures on agencies and invite wasteful litigation.  \nWhen a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, it must adhere to the robust and \nwell-understood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure \nAct, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork \nReduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking \nhas been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political \nparties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations upon a reasoned \ndetermination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to \npromote regulatory flexibility.  \n \nThis Administration is committed to a regulatory system that is informed by science, is cost-\njustified, and is consistent with economic growth.  Through the Regulatory Flexibility Act as \nwell as through Executive Order and the direction of the President, agencies must also ensure \nthat they take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.  Executive \nOrder 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased public participation, harmonization \nof rulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a regulatory retrospective \nreview.  Through Executive Orders 13579 and 13610, the Administration also has taken \nimportant steps to promote systematic retrospective review of regulations by all agencies.  \nCollectively, these requirements promote flexible, commonsense, cost-effective regulation.  \n \nPassage of H.R. 712 would impose additional, unnecessary procedural requirements that would \nseriously undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory mandates.  H.R. 712 would \nrequire numerous, cumbersome layers of reporting from Federal agencies.  It also would address \na nonexistent problem that is already prohibited by Federal regulations:  collusion between \nagencies, interest groups, and the courts to avoid compliance with the rulemaking procedures \ndescribed above.  H.R. 712 accordingly would serve only to introduce redundant processes for \nlitigation settlements and spawn excessive, expensive, and time-consuming regulatory litigation.  \nH.R. 712 therefore would impede the ability of agencies to protect public health, welfare, safety, \nand our environment, as well as to promote economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and \njob creation.  \n  If the President were presented with H.R. 712, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n) \nJuly 15, 2015 \n                    (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3038 \u2013 Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015, Part II \n(Rep. Ryan, R-WI, and Rep. Shuster, R-PA) \n \nWith surface transportation authorization expiring at the end of July, the unfortunate reality is \nthat, due to inaction, Congress will need to pass a short-term extension of these authorities to \nkeep Federal funding for the Nation\u2019s surface transportation system flowing.  While the country \ncannot continue to rely on short-term patches as an approach to funding the Nation\u2019s \ninfrastructure, the Administration supports passage of H.R. 3038 to give the House and Senate \nthe necessary time to complete work on a long-term bill this year that increases investment to \nmeet the Nation's infrastructure needs.   \n \nIn recent decades, Congress routinely passed six-year surface transportation bills, providing \nmuch needed certainty to State and local governments. In comparison, the current series of short-\nterm patches creates significant uncertainty that makes it more difficult to plan and implement \nlong-term investments.  At the same time, Congress has failed to increase investment in the \nNation\u2019s aging surface transportation infrastructure, leaving State and local governments without \nthe resources they need to meet the demands of a growing economy and population.  \n \nIn today's economy, to compete the Nation must have a first-class transportation system that \nattracts first-class jobs and takes American businesses' goods all across the world.  Such a system \ncannot be achieved without a long-term bill with increased levels of investment.  That is why the \nPresident has proposed the GROW AMERICA Act, which would provide robust funding for all \nmodes of surface transportation, create jobs, streamline project approval processes, and \nimplement innovative transportation policies to make better use of taxpayer dollars.   \n \nThe Administration will not support continued failure to make the investments the Nation needs.  \nThe Administration expects that Congress will use this five-month extension to pass a multi-year \nbill with significant increases in investment to address the system\u2019s maintenance and repair \ndeficit, enhance safety, and lay the foundations for future growth in critical areas like freight \nmovement.

Roe, R-TN, and 235 cosponsors) \n \nThe Affordable Care Act has improved the American health care system, on which Americans \ncan rely throughout life.  After more than five years under this law, 16.4 million Americans have \ngained health coverage.  Up to 129 million people who could have otherwise been denied or \nfaced discrimination now have access to coverage.  And, health care prices have risen at the \nslowest rate in nearly 50 years.  As we work to make the system even better, we are open to ideas \nthat improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of health care, and help middle-class \nAmericans.   \n \nThe Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) will be comprised of fifteen expert members, \nincluding doctors and patient advocates, and will recommend to the Congress policies that \nreduce the rate of Medicare growth and help Medicare provide better care at lower costs.  IPAB \nhas been highlighted by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), economists, and \nhealth policy experts as contributing to Medicare\u2019s long-term sustainability.  The Board is \nprohibited from recommending changes to Medicare that ration health care, restrict benefits, \nmodify eligibility, increase cost sharing, or raise premiums or revenues.  Under current law, the \nCongress retains the authority to modify, reject, or enhance IPAB recommendations to \nstrengthen Medicare, and IPAB recommendations would take effect only if the Congress does \nnot act to slow Medicare cost growth.  \n \nH.R. 1190 would repeal and dismantle the IPAB even before it has a chance to work.  The bill \nwould eliminate an important safeguard that, under current law, will help reduce the rate of \nMedicare cost growth responsibly while protecting Medicare beneficiaries and the traditional \nprogram.  While this safeguard is not projected to be needed now or for a number of years given \nrecent exceptionally slow growth in health care costs, it could serve a valuable role should rapid \ngrowth in health costs return.   \n \nCBO estimates that repealing the IPAB would increase Medicare costs and the deficit by \n$7 billion over 10 years.  The Administration would strongly oppose any effort to offset this \nincreased Federal budget cost by reducing the Prevention and Public Health Fund.  The \nAffordable Care Act created this Fund to help prevent disease, detect it early, and manage \nconditions before they become severe.  There has been bipartisan and bicameral support for \nallocation of the Fund, and the Congress directed uses of the Fund through FY 2014 and \nFY 2015 appropriations legislation.  The Fund supports critical investments such as tobacco use \nreduction and programs to reduce health-care associated infections.  By concentrating on the \ncauses of chronic disease, the Fund helps more Americans stay healthy.    \n  The Administration is committed to strengthening Medicare for those who depend on it and \nprotection of the public\u2019s health.

While the Administration does not oppose House passage of H.R. 1195 as \nreported, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1195 as amended by House passage last \nweek of the rule for consideration of the bill, which would reduce the cap on the total amount of \nfunding that could be requested by the Director for the CFPB for FYs 2020 and 2025.  \nThe mandatory creation of additional advisory committees is not necessary because the CFPB \nalready conducts significant stakeholder outreach.  A core component of the Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform) was the creation of the CFPB, \nthe first ever regulator solely dedicated to protecting financial consumers.  The CFPB's mission \nincludes establishing and enforcing clear rules of the road for financial institutions, developing \nconsumer protections and disclosure regimes, and preventing the kind of predatory behavior that \nwas a significant contributor to the 2008 financial crisis.  The CFPB, using existing authority, \nalready convenes a Community Bank Advisory Council and a Credit Union Advisory Council, \neach of which shares with the CFPB its perspectives, experiences, analyses, and \nrecommendations regarding CFPB policy development and rulemaking.  These councils already \ninclude a range of stakeholders.  Moreover, the CFPB is the only financial regulator required to \nconvene a panel prior to proposing a rule to obtain extensive feedback from small businesses on \nany rule that would significantly impact them.   \nMuch more problematic, however, is the reduction in CFPB's funding required by the \namendment adopted as a result of House passage of the rule for consideration of H.R. 1195, \nwhich would reduce the CFPB's available funding in each of FYs 2020 and 2025.  As the CFPB's \nfunding is already capped under law and only increased in line with increases in the Federal \nGovernment's employment cost index, this lower cap is solely intended to impede the CFPB's \nability to carry out its mission of protecting consumers in the financial markets.

In the \nmeantime, H.R. 4557 would undermine the public health protections of the Clean Air Act (CAA) \nby allowing further emissions of approximately 30 tons per month of toxic air pollution from \nbrick and clay products production facilities.  These toxic emissions include mercury, gases, and \nother hazardous metals which are associated with a variety of acute and chronic health effects, \nincluding cancers.   \n \nThe CAA required the Environmental Protection Agency to finalize pollution standards for toxic \nair pollution from all industrial sectors by 2000.

Obstructing \nimplementation of the JCPOA would greatly undermine our national security interests.  It would \nresult in the collapse of a comprehensive diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably \nprevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and in turn would allow for the resumption of a \nsignificantly less constrained Iranian nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international \nsanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to America\u2019s credibility as a leader of \ninternational diplomacy.  This would have ripple effects, jeopardizing both the hard work of \nsustaining a unified coalition to combat Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region and \nAmerica\u2019s ability to lead the world on nuclear non-proliferation. \n  \nBy prohibiting actions to provide relief from nuclear-related sanctions on Iran even if Iran meets \nall of its JCPOA commitments \u2013 significantly rolling back and constraining its nuclear program \nunder an unprecedented verification and monitoring regime \u2013 H.R. 3457 effectively seeks to \nrenegotiate the commitments reached by all of the P5+1, the EU, and Iran, and endorsed by the \nUN Security Council.

The \nAdministration continues to work to explore all possible avenues for compensation, but will not \ndo so in a manner that would connect this issue to the JCPOA, thereby jeopardizing its \nimplementation and Iran\u2019s fulfillment of the critical nuclear steps required under the JCPOA. \n  \nAs we address our concerns with Iran\u2019s nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, \nthe Administration remains clear-eyed and shares the deep concerns of the Congress and the \nAmerican people about Iran\u2019s support for terrorism.

Cochran, R-MS) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of H.R. 2028, making appropriations for \nenergy and water development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2016, and for other purposes.  Although the bill supports key national security items, the bill \ndrastically underfunds critical investments that develop American energy sources to build a clean \nand secure energy future; develop and commercialize the emerging technologies that create high-\nquality jobs and enhance the Nation's economic competitiveness; and improve resilience against \ncurrent and ongoing climate impacts that threaten our economy, public health, and natural \nresources.  As a result, it would put at risk U.S. competitiveness in new markets for clean energy \nindustries such as advanced vehicles, advanced manufacturing, energy efficiency for homes and \nbusinesses, and domestic renewable energy such as wind, solar, and biomass.  If the President \nwere presented with H.R. 2028, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \nEnacting H.R. 2028 and adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending \nlimits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-\nclass priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to \nthreaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be \nmotivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The \nRepublican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense \nfor FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts \nwould result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head \nStart, millions fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and drastic cuts to \nscientific research awards and grants, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the \nmiddle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.    \n \nSequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only \nthrough pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland \nSecurity, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of \nour economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear \nthat he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense \nwithout also fixing non-defense. \n \nThe President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2028 and any other \nlegislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the \ninvestments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense \npriorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members \nof Congress from both parties have urged.    \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) \n \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Administration strongly objects to the \n$1.9 billion provided in the bill for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  \nOverall, this level is $790 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  Relative to the FY 2016 \nBudget request, the bill reduces funding for renewable energy by 34 percent, sustainable \ntransportation by 23 percent, and energy efficiency by 35 percent.  These reductions would \nsignificantly underfund critical activities that support the development and commercialization of \nclean energy technologies including wind energy and advanced manufacturing capabilities.  At \nthis funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in \ncooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced, limiting \ninnovation and technological advancement, curtailing solutions to reduce U.S. dependence on oil \nand reduce energy waste, and undermining the Nation's industrial competitiveness in the future \nglobal clean energy economy.  The Congress is urged to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request \nof $2.7 billion. \n \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration objects to the  \n$291 million provided in the bill for ARPA-E, which is $34 million or 10 percent below the \nFY 2016 Budget request.  This funding reduction would impact investments in transformational \ntechnologies that reduce energy-related emissions, increase energy efficiency across multiple \neconomic sectors, and reduce energy imports. \n \nElectricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.  The Administration objects to the $151 million \nprovided in the bill for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, which is $119 million or  \n44 percent below the FY 2016 Budget request.  At the funding levels provided in the bill, critical \nactivities supporting a secure, reliable, and modernized electricity grid as well as energy \nassurance, would go unfunded.  Investments in a modernized grid are necessary to move the \nNation to a cleaner more secure energy future. \n \nFossil Energy and Nuclear Energy.  The Administration notes that the bill includes funding \nabove the FY 2016 Budget request in some areas that are already well established in the market, \nincluding for nuclear ($948 million, $41 million or 4.5 percent above the FY 2016 Budget \nrequest) and for Fossil Energy Research and Development ($598 million, $38 million or  \n6.8 percent above the FY 2016 Budget request), yet makes drastic reductions in those areas that \nare most crucial to the Nation's clean energy future and continued U.S. technology leadership.  \nThe Administration encourages the Congress to fund DOE's energy programs at the requested \nlevel, as this balances the portfolio among items of short-, medium-, and long-term progress and \naccounts for the potential contributions to U.S. leadership in these technology areas. \n \nOffice of Science.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Office of \nScience, in particular the support for capable exascale computing.  However, the level of funding \nprovided, which is $0.2 billion below the FY 2016 Budget request of $5.3 billion, would reduce \nresearch and development programs throughout the agency and the Administration encourages \nthe Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request. \n \n2  Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).  The Administration opposes the $200 million level \nprovided for the SPR, which is $57 million or 22 percent below the FY 2016 Budget request of \n$257 million.  At this funding level, the bill fails to fund activities supporting timely replacement \nof equipment and physical systems that are necessary to begin to address the backlog of deferred \nmaintenance activities, and to enhance distribution flexibility and reliability.  Absent this \nfunding, the SPR's energy security mission might be at risk. \n \nEnergy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund \nthe FY 2016 Budget request of $131 million for EIA to address critical energy data gaps, expand \ndomestic energy data and analysis, and increase energy data integration with Canada and \nMexico. \n \nNuclear Waste.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for implementing a \nworkable solution for the management and disposal of the Nation's nuclear waste. \n \nFederal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act.  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 312 of the bill, which excludes information technology (IT) spending at DOE labs from \nthe management improvements and accountability introduced by the Federal Information \nTechnology Acquisition Reform Act.  This exclusion would constrain the ability of the Secretary \nand Chief Information Officer to ensure the Department's mission is effectively and efficiently \nexecuted by reducing duplicative IT systems, implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity \nsolution, and addressing other IT management issues, which support the President's goal to \ndeliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and accountable. \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the \nCongress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request for DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission to implement the DATA Act.  This funding would support efforts to provide more \ntransparent Federal spending for data activities, updating IT systems, changing business \nprocesses, and employing a uniform procurement instrument identifier. \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund the FY 2016 Budget \nrequest for DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop a U.S. Digital Service \nteam.  This funding would support efforts to manage digital services that have the greatest \nimpact to citizens and businesses. \n \nCorps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works (Corps) \n \nOverall Funding.  The bill funds the Corps civil works program at a net level of $5.4 billion.  \nThe Administration believes the more appropriate overall funding levels proposed in the \nFY 2016 Budget request would limit spending on projects that provide a low return to the \nNation. \n \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary.  The bill funds the Office of the Assistant Secretary at  \n$3 million, a roughly $2 million, or 35 percent, decrease from the FY 2016 Budget request.  This \nreduction would not support the staffing necessary to provide oversight of the civil works \nprogram. \n \nCorps Regulatory Program.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fund the Corps' \nregulatory program at the requested level.  A $5 million reduction in funding would inhibit the \n3  Corps' ability to issue permits in a timely manner, which could negatively affect business and \ndevelopment, and to protect important aquatic resources, while undertaking needed \nprogrammatic improvements, including implementation of the Clean Water rulemaking. \n \nFill Material under the Clean Water Act.  The Administration believes it is essential to retain \nFederal Agency discretion to pursue rulemakings they deem necessary to protect America's clean \nwater resources, which are critical to American families and businesses.  The Administration \nstrongly opposes section 104 of the bill, which could hamstring future regulatory work. \n \nFederal Flood Risk Management Standard.  The Administration objects to section 503 of the \nbill, which prohibits funds from being used to implement, administer, carry out, modify, revise, \nor enforce Executive Order 13690 entitled \"Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management \nStandard and a Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input.\"  If enacted, \nthis provision would undermine Federal agencies' ability to protect Federal investments and \ncould make our communities more vulnerable to flood risks.  \n \nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, and Central Utah Project \n \nOverall Funding.  The bill provides $1.1 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and $10 million \nfor the Central Utah Project.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support of the \nBureau and the Central Utah Project. \n \nIndian Water Rights Settlements.  The Administration objects to the $23 million or 23 percent \nreduction to the FY 2016 Budget request for the Bureau of Reclamation for implementing \nenacted Indian Water Rights Settlements, including reductions in funding for the Crow \nsettlement of over 80 percent, the Aamodt settlement by more than half, and the Navajo-Gallup \nsettlement by over 10 percent.  The funding requested for these settlements carefully considered \nfunding levels necessary in FY 2016 and future years to meet the dates mandated in the \nsettlement acts.  This reduction would make it difficult to meet Congress' own statutorily-defined \ndeadlines.  Indian water settlement agreements can provide water supply certainty for tribal \ncommunities, boost economic growth, and end expensive and protracted litigation.  The \nAdministration urges the Congress to restore funding for this important program to the levels in \nthe FY 2016 Budget request. \n \nSan Joaquin River Restoration.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support of this \nimportant program to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply \nimpacts.  This restoration program is a multi-year effort that is integral to the implementation of \nFederal legislation that settled 18 years of litigation. \n \nCalifornia Storage Projects.  The Administration strongly supports efforts to help alleviate the \neffects of drought in the West; however, the Administration is concerned with section 207, which \nestablishes deadlines for completing feasibility studies for certain water storage projects.  The \nprovision is unnecessary and the dates provided in the bill could prevent the participation of non-\nFederal partners in certain of the studies and may inhibit the Administration's ability to consider \na full range of options for addressing these issues. \n \nDam Safety Authorization.  Section 205 of the bill amends the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act \nto allow new or supplementary non-safety-related project construction in conjunction with Safety \nof Dams work, provided that the additional costs are allocated to the authorized project purposes.  \n4  Any such authorization should ensure that the beneficiaries of the non-safety-related project \nconstruction pay their full share of the costs as a condition of construction and that there be no \nrepayment contract for that portion of the project. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions in the bill, including sections 101 and 201, raise separation of powers \nconcerns. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n5  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nApril 20, 2016 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nSenate Amendment to H.R. 2028 \u2013 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2017 \n(Sen. Cochran, R-MS) \n \nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2028, \ncontaining the text of S. 2804, making appropriations for energy and water development and \nrelated agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes. \n \nThe Administration welcomes the bill's investments in improving resilience against current and \nongoing climate impacts that threaten our economy, public health, and natural resources, as well \nas the Committee's stated support for the premise and goals of Mission Innovation.  Additionally, \nthe Administration appreciates the Committee's work to support investments in critical \nnonproliferation efforts and in maintaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal.  \nHowever, the bill underfunds critical energy research and development activities and fails to put \nus on an achievable path toward doubling clean energy research and development by FY 2021.  \nSpecifically, the Administration objects to the low funding levels provided for the Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency-Energy and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  \nReductions in both of these programs significantly below the FY 2017 Budget request would \nundermine critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy \ntechnologies.  At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration \nprojects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be \nreduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement.  Funding at this level also would \nimpede development of solutions to reduce U.S. dependence on oil and reduce energy waste, and \nundermine the Nation's competitiveness in the future global clean energy economy. \n \nThe Administration supports the bill's investments in restoring the Nation's aquatic ecosystems, \nimproving commercial navigation, and helping local communities reduce the risk of floods.  \nHowever, the Administration believes funding included in the bill for the Army Corps of \nEngineers beyond the FY 2017 Budget request would not provide a high return on investment to \nthe American taxpayer. \n \nIn October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated \nfor FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense \nspending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class \nfamilies, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that \nagreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  \nHowever, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological \nprovisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the final bill that is presented to  the President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) \n \nMission Innovation.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's stated support for the \npremise and goals of Mission Innovation and the support expressed for the related regional \nconsortia.  However, the bill underfunds critical energy research and development activities and \nfails to put us on an achievable path toward doubling clean energy research and development by \nFY 2021.  The bill underfunds investment in our students, scientists, engineers, and \nentrepreneurs; our businesses and universities; and our future economy.  This would slow the \npace of progress on breakthroughs in energy efficiency and clean energy; undermine America's \nlong-standing, nonpartisan support for pioneering research that seeks solutions to pressing \nproblems; and hinder our ability to harness the power of new ideas and innovation to drive \nsustained economic growth in the clean energy economy of the future. \n \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration objects to the \n$293 million provided in the bill for ARPA-E, a reduction of $57 million or 16 percent from the \ndiscretionary request for ARPA-E in FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduction would hinder the \nability to invest in transformational technologies that reduce energy-related emissions, increase \nenergy efficiency across multiple economic sectors, and reduce energy imports. \n \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  The Administration strongly objects \nto the $2.1 billion provided in the bill for the EERE.  Overall, this level is $825 million below the \nFY 2017 Budget request.  Relative to the FY 2017 Budget request, the bill reduces funding for \nrenewable energy by 26 percent, sustainable transportation by 27 percent, and energy efficiency \nby 20 percent.  These reductions would significantly underfund critical activities that support the \ndevelopment and commercialization of clean energy technologies including wind energy, electric \nand other advanced vehicles, and building technologies.  At this funding level, the number of \nresearch, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, \nuniversities, and the national labs would be reduced, limiting innovation and technological \nadvancement.  Funding at this level also would curtail solutions to reduce U.S. dependence on oil \nand reduce energy waste, and undermine the Nation's competitiveness in the future global clean \nenergy economy.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget \nrequest of $2.9 billion. \n \nElectricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.  The Administration objects to the $206 million \nprovided in the bill for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.  The FY 2017 Budget \nrequested funding levels for research and development (R&D) that provide for a balanced R&D \nportfolio.  This includes funding for important energy storage and transformer resilience and \nadvanced components activities as well as materials activities via the proposed Grid \nManufacturing Institute.  Both the State Distribution-Level Reform and State Energy Assurance \nprograms respond to important Quadrennial Energy Review recommendations and the \nAdministration encourages the Congress to fund these programs. \n \n2  Office of Science.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Office \nof Science, the level of funding provided, which is $172 million below the discretionary total of \nthe FY 2017 Budget request, would significantly impact basic R&D programs. \n \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).  The Administration opposes the $200 million level \nprovided for SPR.  At the bill level, important investments in SPR maintenance activities would \nbe deferred potentially adversely impacting operational readiness. \n \nEnergy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund \nthe FY 2017 Budget request of $131 million for EIA to fully fund investments in adding regional \ndetail to petroleum data, enhancing commercial building energy efficiency data and expanding \ninternational analysis. \n \nNuclear Waste.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for implementing a \nworkable solution for the management and disposal of the Nation's nuclear waste. \n \nDepartmental Administration.  The Administration appreciates language in the bill which \nprovides flexibility to the Department in the management and funding of its support functions \nwithin this account.  However, a 10-percent reduction from the FY 2017 Budget request may \nsignificantly hinder DOE's ability to effectively implement priority management objectives such \nas project management and cost estimating, which ultimately drive greater efficiency within the \nagency. \n \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee's strong support for NNSA's Weapons Activities, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, \nand Naval Reactors programs. \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  While the Administration \nappreciates the funding provided in the bill for DOE to implement the DATA Act, the \nAdministration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission to implement the DATA Act.  This funding would support efforts to \nprovide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology \nsystems, changing business processes, and employing a uniform procurement instrument \nidentifier. \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 \nBudget request for DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop a U.S. Digital \nService team.  This funding would support efforts to manage digital services that have the \ngreatest impact to citizens and businesses. \n \nCorps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works (Corps) \n \nOverall Funding.  The bill funds the Corps civil works program at a net level of $6 billion.  The \nAdministration believes the more appropriate overall funding levels proposed in the FY 2017 \nBudget request which would limit spending on projects that provide a low return to the Nation. \n \nEcosystem Restoration.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for ecosystem \nrestoration activities, such as Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration, Columbia River, \n3  South Florida Ecosystem Restoration, and Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Recovery, at the \nlevels provided in the FY 2017 Budget request. \n \nTechnical Assistance.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee's support for funding \nongoing efforts that provide local communities with technical and planning assistance to enable \nthem to reduce their flood risk, including nonstructural approaches. \n \nFill Material under the Clean Water Act.  The Administration believes that it is essential to \nretain Federal agencies' discretion to pursue rulemakings they deem necessary to protect \nAmerica's clean water resources, which are critical to American families and businesses.  The \nAdministration objects to section 103 of the bill, which could hamstring future regulatory work \nin this area, putting our water resources at risk. \n \nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project \n \nOverall Funding.  The bill provides $1.2 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and $10 million \nfor the Central Utah Project Completion Act.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \nsupport for priorities within the Bureau of Reclamation's program, as reflected in the FY 2017 \nBudget request, including the San Joaquin River Restoration Program, Indian Water Rights \nsettlements, and the WaterSMART program. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n4  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nOctober 20, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1937 \u2013 National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2015 \n(Rep.

Specifically, \nH.R. 1937 would undermine sound Federal decision-making by eliminating appropriate reviews \nunder the National Environmental Policy Act if certain conditions are met, circumventing public \ninvolvement in mining proposals, and bypassing the formulation of alternatives to proposals, \namong other things.  The Administration also opposes the legislation's severe restrictions on \njudicial review.  Although the legislation purports to limit litigation, its extremely short statute of \nlimitations and vague constraints on the scope of prospective relief that a court may issue are \nlikely to have the opposite effect. \n \nThe Administration strongly supports the development of rare earth elements and other critical \nminerals, but rejects the notion that their development is incompatible with existing safeguards \nregarding uses of public lands, environmental protection, and public involvement in agency \ndecision-making. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \n  January 7, 2015 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3 - Keystone XL Pipeline Act \n(Rep.

The bill also would authorize \nthe project despite uncertainty due to ongoing litigation in Nebraska. \n \nBecause H.R. 3 conflicts with longstanding Executive branch procedures regarding the authority \nof the President and prevents the thorough consideration of complex issues that could bear on \nU.S. national interests (including serious security, safety, environmental, and other \nramifications), if presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthis bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n    September 26, 2016 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5303 \u2013 Water Resources Development Act of 2016  \n(Rep. Shuster, R-PA, and 3 cosponsors) \n \nWhile H.R. 5303 would advance some of the Administration's policies and principles including \nbuilding a foundation for long-term economic growth, addressing significant risks to public safety, \nstrengthening the Nation's resilience to the impacts of climate change, and protecting and restoring \nour environment, it should be improved with additional reforms and elimination of problematic \nprovisions.  Additionally, the Administration believes that the Congress should quickly pass \ntargeted funding to support Flint, Michigan, whether in the Water Resources Development Act or \nanother vehicle. \n \nH.R. 5303 would authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to construct several new \nprojects that the Administration has recommended for authorization.  New project and study \nauthorizations should be limited to those most likely to provide high economic or environmental \nreturns to the Nation or address a significant risk to public safety within the Corps' three main \nmission areas: flood and storm damage reduction; commercial navigation; and aquatic ecosystem \nrestoration.  The Administration supports provisions in the bill to de-authorize projects that no \nlonger meet the Nation's needs. \n \nCreating and maintaining the Nation's water resources infrastructure is a shared responsibility \nbetween Federal and non-Federal beneficiaries and requires that the management, use, protection, \nand restoration of our water resources continue to evolve to meet the Nation's future needs.  The \nAdministration welcomes the efforts in the bill to expand options for non-federal project partners \nwho want to cover more of, or all of, the costs to study or construct a Corps project. \n \nThis legislation impedes Administration efforts to both enhance resilience and increase public-\nprivate collaboration and private investment in environmental restoration by establishing a \nconfusing and duplicative mitigation bank program overseen by the RESTORE Council, which \nincludes Governors from only the five states along the Gulf Coast. \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to enact an important reform of the laws governing the \nInland Waterways Trust Fund, which a proposal in the President's FY 2017 Budget would \naccomplish.

Res. 64, a joint resolution of disapproval of the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached between the P5+1 (United States, United \nKingdom, France, China, Russia, and Germany), the European Union, and Iran on July 14, 2015.  \nEnactment of the resolution would greatly undermine our national security interests on multiple \nfronts.  It would effectively block the international community from peacefully and verifiably \npreventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, allow for the resumption of an unconstrained \nand unchecked Iranian nuclear program, and lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions \nregime that was sustained because the Administration sought to diplomatically resolve concerns \nregarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program.  Further, enactment of the resolution would deal a devastating \nblow to America\u2019s credibility as a leader of diplomacy and could ultimately result in the \nexhaustion of alternatives to military action.  If this resolution were enacted, the hard work of \nsustaining a unified coalition to combat Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region would be \nmuch more difficult, as would America\u2019s ability to lead the world on nuclear non-proliferation. \n \nPreventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon has long been a top priority for the United \nStates and for the Administration.  It has been the Administration\u2019s longstanding policy to \nretain all options to achieve that objective \u2013 including possible military options.  At the same \ntime, the Administration has worked diligently with the Congress and our international partners \nto achieve a peaceful, diplomatic solution, recognizing that a negotiated understanding offers a \nmore effective, verifiable, and durable resolution.  The JCPOA achieves this objective by \nreinforcing the prohibition against Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, verifiably cutting off all of \nIran\u2019s potential pathways to a nuclear weapon, and instituting the most comprehensive \ninspection and verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program.  The JCPOA \nmakes the United States and the world safer by removing the gravest threat that Iran could pose \nto the Middle East, including Israel and our Gulf partners.  \n \nThe JCPOA, if faithfully implemented, will verifiably cut off Iran\u2019s ability to pursue a nuclear \nweapon through uranium enrichment, through a plutonium pathway, or through a potential \ncovert path.  Iran is bound under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons to \nnever seek a nuclear weapon and the JCPOA provides the tools to ensure that Iran cannot use a \npeaceful program as cover to pursue a nuclear weapon.  The JCPOA is not based on trust, but \non an unprecedented inspections, monitoring, and transparency regime.  Under the JCPOA, \nthere will be 24/7 monitoring of Iran\u2019s key nuclear facilities.  Inspectors will be able to get \ntimely access to the places they need to go for inspections, or Iran will be in violation of the \nJCPOA and risk the re-imposition of sanctions.  For decades, inspectors will have access to \nIran\u2019s entire nuclear supply chain \u2013 from uranium mines and mills to centrifuge production \nfacilities.  This means that in order for Iran to covertly acquire a nuclear weapon, it would need \nto build an entirely separate, undetected nuclear supply chain.  The JCPOA also facilitates the  International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s ability to complete its report on the possible military \ndimensions of Iran\u2019s pre-2003 program. \n \nThe JCPOA also ensures that Iran has powerful incentives to keep its nuclear \ncommitments.  Before getting phased relief from secondary nuclear-related sanctions, Iran has \nto complete all of its major nuclear steps which will extend the amount of time it would take \nIran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon from the current two to three months to \nat least a year.  For example, the core of Iran\u2019s heavy-water reactor at Arak will be pulled out \nand filled with concrete, rendering it unable to produce plutonium that could be used for a \nweapon; two-thirds of its nearly 20,000 currently installed centrifuges will be removed; its \ncurrent stockpile of enriched uranium will be reduced by 98 percent; and it must put in place \nthe monitoring, surveillance, and access measures that will ensure the ability to verify that its \nnuclear program is used for exclusively peaceful purposes going forward.  If Iran fails to abide \nby its JCPOA commitments, all relieved sanctions, both unilateral and multilateral, can snap \nback into place. \n \nThe Administration is fully committed to continuing to brief and closely consult the Congress as \nwe work with our international partners to ensure successful implementation of the JCPOA.  As \nwe address our concerns with Iran\u2019s nuclear program through the JCPOA, the Administration \nremains clear-eyed and shares the deep concerns of the Congress and the American people \nabout Iran\u2019s support for terrorism, its destabilizing role in the region, and its human rights \nabuses \u2013 this is why we will continue to vigorously enforce our sanctions against these activities \nand work closely with our partners in the region to counter them, using a range of unilateral and \nmultilateral tools. \n \nThe JCPOA must be assessed by what it achieves on its central goal of preventing Iran from \nobtaining a nuclear weapon \u2013 and the Administration urges the Congress to fully consider the \nstakes for our national security of walking away without the international community.  Without \nthe JCPOA in place, Iran would likely resume the advancement of its nuclear program without \nany of the constraints or transparency required by this deal and without the international unity \nof our sanctions regime, which would be the worst of all possible worlds, leaving us in a \nposition of weakness, not strength. \n \nThe President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful \nimplementation of the JCPOA.  If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 64, he would veto \nthe resolution.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  September 28, 2016 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nSenate Amendment to H.R. 5325 \u2013 Continuing Appropriations and Military Construction, \nVeterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 and Zika Response and \nPreparedness Act, 2016  \n(Sen. Cochran, R-MS) \n \nThe Administration supports passage of Senate Amendment to H.R. 5325, making:   \n1) continuing appropriations for fiscal year (FY) 2017; 2) appropriations for military \nconstruction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the FY ending \nSeptember 30, 2017; 3) additional resources available to combat the Zika virus; and 4) for other \npurposes.   \n \nBy providing a short-term funding bridge, the bill would allow critical Government functions to \noperate without interruption.  To minimize the negative impacts of a short-term funding measure \non Federal agencies, the Congress should act quickly to enact full-year appropriations legislation \nfor the remainder of FY 2017.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress \nto support investments equally balanced between defense and non-defense spending that will \ncreate jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national \nsecurity.  \n \nThe Administration is disappointed the legislation continues a provision that would bar the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission from taking action to increase transparency in public \ncompanies' political spending.  The Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of \nproblematic provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation. \n \nThe Administration is also disappointed that\u2014despite overwhelming bipartisan, bicameral \nsupport\u2014the Congress failed to ensure that the Export-Import Bank is able to fully assist \nAmerican businesses and workers by restoring a board quorum to the Bank. \n \nThe Administration appreciates that the Congress is finally taking bipartisan action to address the \nZika virus.  The funding provided in the bill supports the Administration's efforts to reduce the \nrisk of the Zika virus, particularly in pregnant women, by better controlling the mosquitoes that \nspread the Zika virus, develop new tools, including vaccines and better diagnostics to protect the \nNation from the Zika virus, and to conduct crucial research projects needed to better understand \nthe impacts of the Zika virus on infants and children.  The Administration appreciates that the \nbill is free of provisions that would inhibit the Administration's ability to target resources to best \nprotect the American people from the Zika virus.  However, the Administration continues to \nbelieve that funding to fight the Zika virus should be treated as an emergency, the same as past \npublic health emergencies, and is disappointed that the funding is partially offset. \n \nThe Administration is pleased that there appears to be a path forward to provide targeted funding \nto support people in communities impacted by natural disasters and catastrophic events,  including in Louisiana, Flint, Michigan, and other areas.  The Administration welcomes the bill's \ninvestments in communities ravaged by natural disasters, but notes that the funding provided is \ninsufficient to fully address needed recovery efforts in these and other communities.  Upon its \nreturn in November, the Administration urges the Congress to take immediate action to provide \nfunding, whether in an appropriations bill or another vehicle, that supports those who have been \nmost impacted by natural disasters and other catastrophic events.  \n \nIn addition, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in military infrastructure, \nhousing, and services for men and women in our Armed Forces and their families.  The \nAdministration also appreciates the Congress' commitment to fund the benefits and services our \nveterans have earned. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n2  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nMay 12, 2015 \n (House Rules) \nS O A P  \nTATEMENT  F  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 1735 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2016 \n(Rep. Thornberry, R-TX, and 1 cosponsor) \nThe Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s continued support of \nour national defense and supports a number of provisions in H.R. 1735, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, such as authorities that support ongoing \noperations.  The Administration also appreciates many of the acquisition reform measures \nincluded in the bill and looks forward to continued cooperation with the Committee on further \nprogress in this area.   \nWhile there are areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration strongly objects to a \nnumber of provisions in the bill.  First, the President has been very clear about the core principle \nthat he will not support a budget that locks in sequestration, and he will not fix defense without \nfixing non-defense spending.  Sequestration levels will damage our ability to restore readiness, \nadvance badly-needed technological modernization, and keep faith with our troops and their \nfamilies.  Unfortunately, the bill fails to authorize sufficient funding for our military\u2019s priorities, \nand instead uses Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in ways that leaders of both \nparties have made clear are inappropriate.  Shifting base budget resources into OCO risks \nundermining a mechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts and fails to \nprovide a stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning is based.  The use of OCO \nfunding to circumvent budget caps in defense spending also ignores the long-term connection \nbetween national security and economic security and fails to account for vital national security \nfunctions carried out at non-defense agencies.    \nFurther, the bill fails to adopt many of the needed force structure and weapons system reforms \nincluded in the President\u2019s Budget, including failing to provide an authorization for a new Base \nRealignment and Closure (BRAC) round to allow the Department of Defense (DOD) to properly \nalign the military\u2019s infrastructure with the needs of its evolving force.  It also includes non-\ngermane provisions, such as those undermining the Endangered Species Act, that have nothing to \ndo with national defense.  The President\u2019s defense strategy depends on investing every dollar \nwhere it will have the greatest effect, which the Administration\u2019s FY 2016 proposals will \naccomplish through critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, slow growth in \ncompensation, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The Committee\u2019s changes would constrain the \nability of DOD to align military capability and force structure with the President\u2019s defense \nstrategy and to reduce unneeded costs.  The bill also continues unwarranted restrictions, and \nimposes onerous additional ones, regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay.  If this bill were \npresented to the President, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend to the President that \nhe veto it.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these and other concerns, \na number of which are outlined in more detail below, and urges Congress to work in a bipartisan \nfashion to make necessary changes to the bill.  In particular, this is the time to come together to \nfind a comprehensive and real solution to sequestration that strengthens both our security and our \neconomy.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the classified annex and working \nwith the Congress to address any concerns on classified programs.   \nGuantanamo Detainee Provisions:  The Administration strongly objects to several provisions of \nthe bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  As the Administration has \nsaid many times before, operating this facility weakens our national security by draining \nresources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent \nextremists.  Rather than taking steps to bring this chapter of our history to a close, as the \nPresident has repeatedly called upon Congress to do, this bill aims to extend it.  Not only would \nit extend existing restrictions, it would impose additional unwise and unnecessary ones that \nwould further impede efforts to responsibly close the facility.  Under existing law, the Secretary \nof Defense is already required to make a determination that actions have been or will be taken to \nsubstantially mitigate risks to the United States or U.S. persons or interests posed by detainee \ntransfers abroad.  Sections 1038 and 1039 would impose still more onerous restrictions on such \ntransfers, and, in some cases, seek to prohibit certain transfers entirely.  Sections 1036 and 1037 \nwould prohibit the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States or to \nconstruct or modify any facility in the United States to house detainees.  The President has \nobjected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation.  The restrictions \ncontained in this bill are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch\u2019s \nability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when \nand where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national \nsecurity interests, and when and where to transfer them consistent with our national security and \nour humane treatment policy.  Sections 1036, 1038, and 1039 would, moreover, violate \nconstitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances, and section 1038 \ncould in some circumstances interfere with a detainee\u2019s right to the writ of habeas corpus.  In \naddition, section 1034 would require burdensome and unnecessary reporting to Congress and \ncould interfere with the President\u2019s authority to protect sensitive national security information.  \nSections 1040 and 1041 would impermissibly require the disclosure of certain documents, \nincluding those protected by privilege, and restrict specified DOD funds until those documents \nare provided to Congress, despite the Administration\u2019s ongoing cooperation in providing \ndocuments and information to Congress.  \nSequestration and Misuse of OCO Funds:  The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s \nauthorization of sequester level appropriations for items that were requested in and belong in the \nbase budget, and use of OCO - a funding mechanism intended to pay for wars and not subject to \nthe budget caps - to pay for $38 billion in base requirements.  Sequestration adds risk to our \nnational security by threatening the size, readiness, presence, and capability of our military, and \nthreatens the economic security on which our national security depends.  The Committee clearly \nrecognizes that the President\u2019s Budget level for defense is needed, but authorizes it in a way that \nfails to acknowledge the need to reverse sequestration for both defense and non-defense \nspending. \n2  Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) \nRecommendations:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for some of the \nMCRMC recommendations to improve our military compensation and retirement systems, and \nencourages Congress to support the additional recommendations for which DOD has \ntransmitted legislation.  The Administration is still evaluating how the more complex \nrecommendations - such as the Blended Retirement System and Reserve Component Duty \nStatuses - would affect the All-Volunteer Force, and expects to provide the Committee with \nfurther views on these proposals in the coming months.  The Administration looks forward to \ncontinuing to work with Congress and the MCRMC on these provisions to meet our solemn \nresponsibility to ensure that any changes protect the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer \nForce, improve quality-of-life for service members and their families, and safeguard the fiscal \nsustainability of the military compensation and retirement systems. \nCompensation Reform:  The President\u2019s Budget provides the funding and common-sense \nreforms that will ensure that service members receive competitive pay and benefits and critical \ntraining and equipment.  The Administration believes it is imperative to slow the growth of basic \npay and housing allowances, modernize military healthcare, and reform how commissaries \noperate, and strongly encourages members of Congress to support these reforms, which would \nsave $1.7 billion in FY 2016 and $18 billion through FY 2020.   \nAmong these reforms are proposed improvements that will modernize the TRICARE program.  \nTRICARE remains fundamentally unchanged since its inception in the mid-1990s and is \nantiquated by contemporary health plan standards.  The Consolidated Health Plan structure \nwould provide DOD with substantial projected savings, simplify TRICARE for beneficiaries, \nand offer participants more freedom to choose providers.  Failing to enact the TRICARE and \nother various reform proposals would compel DOD to take additional reductions in the areas of \nreadiness, modernization, and force structure.  The Administration looks forward to working \nwith Congress on these and other reforms to modernize and enhance the military health care \nsystem. \nProhibition on Conducting Additional BRAC Round:  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 2702, which would preclude any funds being authorized for use toward an additional \nBRAC round.  This impairs the ability of the Executive Branch to plan for contingencies or make \nother needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The \nAdministration strongly urges Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which \nwould allow DOD to rightsize its infrastructure while providing important assistance to affected \ncommunities, freeing resources currently consumed by maintaining unneeded facilities.  In the \nabsence of authorization of a new round of BRAC, the Administration will pursue alternative \noptions to reduce this wasteful spending and ensure that DOD\u2019s limited resources are available \nfor the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security. \nModification of Authority to Provide Assistance to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the \nLevant:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1223, which would significantly restrict \nthe authority to provide the Government of Iraq with assistance to counter the Islamic State in \nIraq and the Levant (ISIL) and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to \nimplement the President\u2019s strategy to counter ISIL.  The provisions providing that three groups \nshould be treated as \u201ca country\u201d for certain assistance purposes and mandating that assistance be \nprovided directly to specific groups - even absent authorization from the Government of Iraq - \nare particularly damaging, have already created negative diplomatic consequences for the United \n3  States, are inconsistent with the longstanding U.S. foreign policy of working to maintain a stable, \nunified Iraq, and could put the United States at risk of violating Iraq\u2019s sovereignty as well as the \narms embargo on Iraq established by relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.  These \nprovisions would fundamentally undermine the Government of Iraq and undercut our ongoing \nmilitary operations in coordination with the Government of Iraq to degrade, destroy, and \nultimately defeat ISIL.  Moreover, while the Government of Iraq has made progress toward \npolitical reconciliation, that process is ongoing, and requiring that the provision of the assistance \nspecified in section 1223 be contingent on satisfaction of all conditions articulated in that section \ncould undermine this progress.  Finally, with the consent and full support of the Government of \nIraq, the United States already has provided - and plans to continue to provide - significant \nmilitary assistance to the security forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government and Sunni tribal \nsecurity forces.   \nRocket Propulsion System Development Program:  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 1603, which would place restrictions on the funds to eliminate the Nation\u2019s use of non-\nallied space launch engines for national security space launches by 2019.  The Administration \nalso strongly objects to moving Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) development \nfunding into the more restrictive Rocket Propulsion System Development line item.  The \nAdministration is committed to transitioning from non-allied engines; however, an engine-\ncentric approach as laid out in this section would not preserve the Nation\u2019s assured access to \nspace.  While rocket engines are a major component of a launch vehicle, they are only one of \nmany critical components.  These components must be designed and developed together to meet \nthe ultimate cost and performance goals, not only for the launch vehicle but also for the support, \noperations, and production infrastructure as well.  Without a comprehensive strategy that ensures \nthe availability of operational launch systems, the government risks investing hundreds of \nmillions of dollars without any guarantee of ensuring assured access to space.   \nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund:  The Administration objects to the elimination of the \nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF) because it removes a flexible, partnership-focused \napproach to counterterrorism.  While the Administration is appreciative of support for the border \nsecurity and capability enhancements for Jordan, military construction, and specific counter- \nISIL programs, redirecting CTPF funding to these other activities precludes DOD from building \non existing tools and authorities to respond to a range of terrorist threats.  The Administration \nstrongly encourages Congress to authorize the $2.1 billion originally requested to continue \nsupport for CTPF activities in FY 2016. \nSense of Congress on the Government of Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program and Malign Military Activities:  \nSection 1232 contains language pertaining to the ongoing P5+1 nuclear negotiations with Iran \nthat will likely undermine our negotiating team as they work with our international partners to \nachieve a long-term, comprehensive deal that prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  \nOpen Skies Treaty:  The Administration objects to section 1244, which would change the \nreporting requirement to provide an assessment to Congress on Russian proposals to introduce \nnew or modified sensors or aircraft from 30 days to 90 days prior to the United States certifying \nthe aircraft or sensors.  The 90-days requirement is impractical as it is only 30 days after we will \nbe informed of Russia\u2019s notification of intent to certify, generally before analyses are completed.  \nThe Administration also objects to section 1265, which would limit the availability of Research, \nDevelopment, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds for arms control implementation in the Air \nForce until the Secretary of Defense reports to Congress on issues related to the Open Skies \nTreaty.  The provision could affect the ability of the United States to modernize its observation \n4  aircraft sensors by delaying funding needed to upgrade from wet film to digital sensors.  \nMissile Defense Programs:  While appreciating the Committee\u2019s support of DOD\u2019s ballistic \nmissile defense programs, the Administration objects to section 1668 requiring a concurrent \nanti-air warfare capability at the Aegis Ashore site in Poland and Romania by 2018.  This \nrequirement would entail hardware and software upgrades not previously planned and would \nintroduce additional costs and potentially delay the deployment in Poland.  Installing this \ncapability would also require amending previously negotiated agreements with the host nation as \nwell as extensive discussions with our NATO Allies.  The Administration also objects to the \nrequirement that a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery be available for rotational \ndeployment to U.S. European Command\u2019s area of responsibility.  This requirement would \nconstrain DOD\u2019s flexibility in managing these high-demand/low-density assets.  The \nAdministration objects to the section 1401 authorization of $30 million in FY 2016 for the \nplanning and design of an East Coast missile field.  The authorization is premature and other \nmissile defense requirements have higher priority.  The Administration objects to the \nrequirement of section 1673 to homeport the Sea-based X-band (SBX) radar on the East Coast in \n2020, which does not take into consideration the threat environment or cost and may constrain \nDOD\u2019s ability to best defend the United States.   \nAlternative Fuels:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 315 and 316, which would \nimpede DOD\u2019s use of alternative fuels.  Sections 315 and 316 would impede efforts to foster a \ndiverse, cost-competitive energy supply that enhances energy security for both military uses and \ncivilian aviation.  Section 315, which would exempt DOD from section 526 of the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007, undercuts a law passed with strong bipartisan support \nthat provides an environmentally sound framework for the development of future alternative \nfuels.  Section 316, which would prevent the Secretary of Defense from entering into contracts to \nconstruct biofuels refineries, would restrict DOD\u2019s discretion to support the development of \ndrop-in alternative military fuels to improve fuel diversity, increase operational flexibility, and \nmanage budgetary risks associated with oil prices.  A diverse approach to energy security - one \nthat includes both conventional and new sources - would benefit the economy and enhance our \nmilitary capability.  \nAdditional Requirements for Streamlining of Department of Defense Management Headquarters: \nWhile the Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s support for the Department\u2019s plan to \nreduce headquarters personnel and spending by 20 percent, the Administration strongly objects \nto section 905 as unnecessary.  The Department\u2019s execution of then-Secretary of Defense \nHagel\u2019s Department-wide 20 percent headquarters reduction plan projects savings of $5.3 \nbillion.  These cuts were incorporated into the President\u2019s FY 2016 Budget and will continue \nthrough FY 2019.  Section 905 also is overly restrictive in scope because it targets the National \nCapital Region and exempts DOD civilians whose salaries are funded from the Defense \nWorking Capital Fund.  This could have a profound impact on personnel and cause arbitrary \nacross-the-board cuts.  \nLevel of Readiness of Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Carriers:  The Administration strongly \nobjects to section 1084, which would severely constrain DOD\u2019s flexibility in managing the \nmilitary airlift system by effectively requiring the Department to set aside a projected minimum \namount of business for commercial air carriers without prior considerations of the impacts on \nmilitary readiness.  DOD\u2019s management of commercial air carrier support ensures commercial \naugmentation must not be at the expense of the operational readiness of organic military airlift.  \nHowever, section 1084 would mandate a consultative - and inherently conflicting - role for \nindustry in apportioning business between commercial and organic resources, inhibiting military \n5  airlift readiness, the military airlift system, and DOD\u2019s ability to rapidly respond to emerging \nairlift requirements.  \nRequirement to Provide Certain Documents to Congress:  The Administration objects to section \n1061, which would require the provision of summaries of defense planning guidance and \ncontingency planning guidance to Congress.  Release of these summaries outside the Executive \nBranch could detrimentally affect the Department\u2019s programs by interfering with the ability of \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense to give direction to subordinate military commanders \nand by compromising the candor and confidentiality of the advice given to the Secretary of \nDefense.  \nCongressional Notification of Sensitive Military Operations:  The Administration strongly \nobjects to section 1032, which modifies section 130f of title 10, United States Code, by striking \nthe explicit Afghanistan exception to the notification requirement for sensitive military \noperations.  Afghanistan continues to be regarded as an area of active hostilities.  The \ncounterterrorism mission to defeat the remnants of al-Qa\u2019ida is ongoing, in addition to operations \nto prevent attacks by other extremist groups threatening U.S. forces and personnel in \nAfghanistan.  This amendment would place an undue burden on the Executive branch, which \nalready reports extensively to Congress on U.S. operations in Afghanistan.  \nRestriction on Retirement of the A-10:  The Administration strongly objects to section 133, \nwhich is inconsistent with DOD\u2019s fiscal constraints and current priorities.  Section 133 would \nrestrict DOD from obligating or expending funds to retire A-10 aircraft as well as require a study \nby an independent agency focusing on what capabilities should be included in an A-10 \nreplacement.  The retirement restriction puts at risk needed recapitalization efforts impacting the \nacquisition and manning of the Air Force fighter enterprise.  Additionally, the study specifies \ncapability thresholds that may or may not be valid in future conflicts.  DOD believes the Joint \nStrike Fighter and other multi-mission aircraft will replace the A-10\u2019s singular mission of close \nair support while also providing other critical capabilities.   \nModernization of Ticonderoga Class Cruisers:  The Administration strongly objects to the \nCommittee\u2019s restrictions on the Department\u2019s plan to modernize its Ticonderoga Class Cruisers.  \nThe Committee\u2019s provision would erase planned savings of $300 million to $400 million, result \nin early depletion of Ship Modernization, Operations and Sustainment Fund funds, and \naccelerate the retirement of the cruisers.  The Administration also strongly objects to the \nprovision restricting the removal of ballistic missile defense capability from the cruisers.  \nMaintaining this capability on cruisers will prevent scheduled combat systems upgrades, and \nupgrading the ballistic missile defense capability will increase overall modernization costs and \ndelay the Navy\u2019s cruiser modernization.  \nNational Guard Civil and Defense Support Activities and Related Matters:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 515, which would authorize Governors and Adjutants General of the \nvarious States to expend DOD funds to employ the National Guard of their States to perform \nsupport operations, missions, or activities in support of a civil authority of a State or Federal \nagency.  This unwarranted intrusion on the authorities of the President and the Secretary of \nDefense would impose significant fiscal burdens on an already tight defense budget in order to \nfund non-defense missions, expose DOD to legal and fiscal risks for missions not under its \ncontrol, and circumvent the national response system.  \n6  Limitation on Project Authorization to Carry Out Certain FY 2016 Projects:  The Administration \nobjects to section 2310, which would limit expending funds associated with the construction of \nJoint Intelligence Analysis Complex Consolidation (JIAC), Phase 2, at Royal Air Force \nCroughton, United Kingdom, and would limit action to realign forces at Lajes Field, Azores, \nuntil the Department conveys specific information to the Committee.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with Congress on this issue in order to avoid the potential for significant \nfinancial costs during a period of constrained resources, uncertainty among our allies that share \nequities in the JIAC, and disruption in intelligence support to the warfighter.  \nProhibition on Per Diem Allowance Reductions Based on the Duration of Temporary Duty \nAssignment or Civilian Travel:  The Administration objects to section 602, which would prohibit \na reduced rate of per diem for uniformed service members and DOD civilian employees based on \nthe duration of travel.  This prohibition, which applies only to DOD, is counterproductive to a \ngrowing government-wide trend toward implementing flat rate per diem for long-term travel.  \nSection 602 would nullify an evidence-based policy decision that fairly compensates DOD \ntravelers, demonstrates the Department\u2019s stewardship of taxpayer funds, and meets external \nmandates to simplify travel and reduce costs.  It also would negate an estimated $81.5 million in \nannual programmed savings and would produce additional contingency travel costs while \nimposing an unfunded annual requirement on the military departments.  \nUnrequested Funding:  In this fiscally constrained environment, the Administration objects to the \nauthorization of billions of dollars of unnecessary funding offset by equal cuts to higher priority \nitems requested in the President\u2019s Budget.  Unrequested items include $1.15 billion for extra \nF/A-18 aircraft, $1 billion for extra Joint Strike Fighters, $683 million to keep A-10 aircraft,  \n$128 million for extra UH-60 helicopters, and $722 million to reverse planned savings associated \nwith compensation reform proposals to slow the growth in basic housing allowance payments \nand to reform commissary operations.  The Administration has made extensive efforts to assess, \nprioritize, and balance force capacity, capability, and readiness in developing the FY 2016 \nBudget.  Extra programs inserted in the budget come at the expense of programs that are more \nimportant, and will create ripple effects across the rest of the budget. \nOperation and Maintenance and Military Personnel Reductions:  The Administration objects to \nthe billions of dollars of undistributed reductions in the bill across the operation and maintenance \nand military personnel accounts.  The operation and maintenance reductions would be applied to \nthose programs funded in section 4301, which include readiness, depot maintenance, base \noperations support, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These \nreductions will delay the Department\u2019s full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts and increase the \nbacklog of maintenance at the military departments\u2019 depot facilities.  \nRestrictions on the Overhaul and Repair of Naval Vessels in Foreign Shipyards:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 1021, which would prohibit the Navy from proceeding \nwith planned overhaul, repair, or maintenance efforts with a duration of more than six months, \nwhich are scheduled to be accomplished in foreign shipyards on ships whose homeports are not \nin the United States or Guam.  This restriction on Forward Deployed Naval Force ships would \nreduce operational availability and increase costs due to the transit time to the United States or \nGuam, and negatively affect Sailors\u2019 quality of life by subjecting them to extended separations \nfrom their families.  Alternatively, changing ship homeports would cause harm to Sailors and \ntheir families by requiring earlier and more frequent relocations.  \n7  Unified Medical Command:  The Administration strongly objects to section 711, which would \ndirect DOD to establish a Unified Medical Command (UMC).  In addition to already possessing \nthe necessary authorities to organize its medical forces, past reviews by the Department have \nconcluded a UMC is not in the best interest of the Department.  In order to best balance oversight \nfrom the Office of the Secretary of Defense with the Services\u2019 mission needs, the Department \nbelieves that the current organizational construct contained in the Defense Health Agency is \noptimal.  The establishment of a UMC would likely impose significant costs without realizing \nefficiencies or savings.  \nProposed Realignments of Military Medical Treatment Facilities:  The Administration objects to \nsection 713, which would require a mandatory 90-day waiting period before restructuring or \nrealigning a military treatment facility and impose a burdensome reporting requirement.  As the \nArmy, for example, draws down end strength, it must have the flexibility to realign medical \ncapabilities corresponding to end strength levels.  Keeping medical personnel at underutilized \nfacilities directly impacts the ability to properly resource fully utilized facilities and to have our \nmedical providers maintain their clinical skills.  Any delay would adversely affect medical \nreadiness and clinical proficiency to the detriment of our Soldiers and their families.  \nLandmines:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1057, which would limit the \navailability of funds for the destruction of anti-personnel landmines.  This provision would \ninterfere with DOD\u2019s ability to dispose of unneeded munitions and undermine the \nAdministration\u2019s policy of working to eliminate anti-personnel landmine stockpiles other than \nthose required for the defense of the Republic of Korea. \nLimitation on Service Secretary Revocation of Combat Valor Awards:  The Administration \nobjects to section 582, which would infringe on the authority of the military service Secretaries \nto revoke certain combat valor awards.  Such a limitation would create a disconnect with the \nauthority vested in the Secretaries to approve valor awards.  Current provisions of title 10, that \nprohibit award or presentation of valor medals to a person whose continuous and on-going \nservice has not been honorable, protect the integrity of awards by ensuring that they are not \ngiven to those who might demand the benefits of the award even after engaging in heinous \ncriminal acts, such as hostile acts against the United States and sexual assault.   \nDisposition of Weapons-Usable Plutonium:  The Administration strongly objects to section \n3116, which would require the Secretary of Energy to carry out construction and project support \nactivities for the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility.  This language is unnecessarily \nrestrictive and would preclude alternative, and potentially more cost-effective approaches to \nimplementing U.S. commitments in the 2000 Plutonium Management and Disposition \nAgreement and its 2010 annex to dispose of excess weapons plutonium.  The Department of \nEnergy (DOE) contracted for an independent validation of costs for plutonium disposition \nalternatives in accordance with congressional mandates.  Based on the first phase of this analysis, \nthe remaining costs for disposing of plutonium using the MOX approach exceed $47 billion, \nwhich is over $22 billion more than the preliminary estimates done in 2014.  The results of this \nanalysis will inform the Administration's approach to plutonium disposition.   \nNuclear Weapons Dismantlement:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3121, which \nwould limit funding for nuclear weapons dismantlement.  It restricts the Executive Branch\u2019s \nability to determine the appropriate stockpile adjustments to meet national security goals and \nruns counter to the Nation\u2019s commitments in support of the goals of the Nuclear Nonproliferation \nTreaty.  Requiring the President to certify that any dismantlement is for a life extension program \n8  constrains our ability to respond expeditiously to the needs of the stockpile.  Additionally, the \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) already provides annually, in the Stockpile \nStewardship and Management Plan, dismantlement accomplishments and plans for the future.  \nNonproliferation Technology Development:  The Administration strongly objects to section \n3120, which would limit funds for nonproliferation or arms control verification or monitoring \ntechnologies from being used to develop technologies beyond technology readiness level (TRL) \n5 unless certain requirements are met.  NNSA activities span the full range of TRLs, from basic \nresearch to production and deployment.  As drafted, this language would significantly impede \ndevelopment of all high TRL work including:  space-based nuclear detonation detection; \nadvanced radiation detection; nuclear safeguards; emergency response and verification; and \nmonitoring technology.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can only meet its \nmission if it has state-of-the-art safeguards approaches and technologies.  This is particularly \nimportant as we look forward to the IAEA\u2019s safeguards implementation responsibilities. \nAuthorization of Production of Special Nuclear Material Outside the United States by Foreign \nCountry with Nuclear Naval Propulsion Program:  The Administration strongly objects to section \n3119, which would limit and condition authorizations under 10 CFR Part 810 of technology \ntransfers and assistance to countries that have a naval nuclear propulsion program.  Countries \nwith such programs include generally authorized countries such as the United Kingdom, France, \nand Brazil, as well as countries like Russia, China, and India, for which specific authorization is \nrequired.  The Secretary would be prohibited from issuing authorizations with respect to such \ncountries until the Director of National Intelligence and the Chief of Naval Operations submit an \nassessment to the specified committees of the risks of diversion of such nuclear technology \ntransfer to a country\u2019s naval nuclear propulsion program, even if the technology or assistance has \nno relationship to or utility in naval propulsion.  Halting these authorizations would have a \nsignificant negative financial impact on the U.S. nuclear industry and on diplomatic relations \nbetween the United States and the impacted countries.  \nFixed Site Radiation Portal Monitors:  The Administration objects to section 3117, which would \nprohibit use of FY 2016 and subsequent fiscal year funds for research and development, \ninstallation, or sustainment of fixed site radiological portal monitors or equipment in foreign \ncountries.  This prohibition would preclude maintenance, training, and gradual transition to \nindigenous support for equipment to detect potential trafficking in nuclear and radiological \nmaterials, an important element of the U.S. multi-faceted strategy to interdict materials outside of \nregulatory control.  It would also negatively impact U.S. relationships and cooperation with \nforeign partners to prevent proliferation of nuclear and radiological materials.  \nPersonnel Levels:  The Administration objects to section 3111, which would limit the size of the \nNNSA Federal workforce needed to provide necessary program and project guidance and \noversight to execute nuclear security programs.  NNSA must have the ability to recruit, hire, and \nretain a highly skilled Federal workforce that includes an appropriate mix of competitive and \nexcepted service in order to fulfill its mission consistent with programmatic requirements.  The \ncap on Federal competitive staffing unduly restricts NNSA's flexibility and places at risk the \nappropriate, and inherently governmental Federal oversight and management of critical \nprograms. \nTransfer of Nonoperational Facilities:  The Administration objects to section 3141, which would \nrequire the transfer of NNSA excess facilities within three years to the Environmental \nManagement (EM) program for decontaminating and decommissioning (D&D).  In January \n9  2015, the Secretary established a working group that is already developing an analysis and \noptions for how the Department may prioritize and address the numerous contaminated excess \nfacilities owned by the various DOE program offices.  The path forward for disposition of these \nfacilities should be determined through this ongoing analysis and appropriate planning, not a \nrequired three-year timeline for transfer.  Although the Administration agrees that high-risk, \nexcess facilities should be \u201cdispositioned\u201d quickly, safely, and cost-effectively, section 3141 \nwould not address the underlying issue of risk because the Department is unable to undertake \nD&D of all of these facilities in the foreseeable future due to ongoing mission requirements and \nenforceable regulatory cleanup commitments.  \nUranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund:  The Administration objects \nto section 4701, which would eliminate the authorization of appropriations for the contribution \nto the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund.  This funding is \ncritical to the Administration\u2019s proposal to reauthorize the Fund to address the significant \nshortfall in resources allocated for cleanup of shutdown uranium enrichment plants that \nsupported nuclear weapons production and commercial power generation. \nGreater Sage-Grouse and Public Land Management:  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 2862, which would mandate a delay until 2025 in listing or deciding not to list the \nGreater Sage-Grouse under the Endangered Species Act and would effectively override \nlongstanding principles of major Federal land management statues, including the Federal Land \nPolicy and Management Act and the National Forest Management Act.  Such unprecedented \ndelays undermine science-based decision-making, are unnecessary for military readiness, and are \nill-advised for purposes of public land management.  Such delays create uncertainty for \nlandowners and businesses, and effectively suspend unprecedented collaborative conservation \nefforts that have been developed with extensive public input.  Additional provisions would divest \nstewardship of Federal land from Federal agencies, requiring these lands to be managed \nconsistent with State-approved management plans.  Moreover, existing law already allows the \nSecretary of Defense to obtain an exemption of any action from the requirements of the \nEndangered Species Act for reasons of national security. \nThe National Historic Preservation Act:  The Administration objects to section 2853, which \nwould amend the National Historic Preservation Act to allow Federal agencies to object to a \ndesignation of Federal properties for reasons of national security.  Listing a property on the \nNational Register of Historic Places, or designating it as a National Historic Landmark, does not \nlimit any Federal agency\u2019s decision-making authority.  Decisions on how to manage the \nproperty, informed by the evaluation of its significance and integrity, remain the responsibility of \nthe agency with jurisdiction over that property.  The Administration is not aware of any specific \ninstance where such a designation has adversely affected national security.  Enactment of this \nsection could lead to a fundamental weakening of highly successful and widely admired \nprograms that Congress intended to help recognize and protect our shared heritage. \nMilitary Land Withdrawals:  The Administration has concerns with the bill\u2019s provisions relating \nto military land withdrawals.  The responsible agencies will continue to coordinate to facilitate \nresponsible use of public lands to support military readiness, training, and testing, \nacknowledging the current system of periodic legislative re-withdrawals is not particularly \nefficient and does not provide for the optimum land management regime.  But, the \nAdministration is not prepared to support transfers of such lands without a process that provides \ncareful consideration of the evolving needs, interests, and any supporting legislative provisions.  \nThe Administration stands ready to consider measures and approaches to make the use of public \n10  lands for military needs more efficient. \nThe Annual Compliance Report:  The Administration has concerns with section 1262 as it vests \nin the Office of the Director of National Intelligence functions for which the Department of State \nhas lead responsibility, specifically regarding international compliance with arms control and \nnonproliferation agreements and commitments.  The Department of State is uniquely positioned \nto provide policy and legal expertise on a range of complex arms control compliance issues and \nalready has the responsibility to prepare an annual report on such compliance.  \nSpecial Immigrant Visas (SIV):  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s indication of \nsupport for continuation of the Afghan SIV program, but is concerned about the absence of \nauthority to provide additional visas for this program in the bill.  The Administration proposes an \nadditional 5,000 visas for FY 2016.  The SIV program enables Afghan nationals who have aided \nU.S. efforts through their work, and who have experienced or are experiencing an ongoing \nserious threat as a result, to apply for these visas.  The Administration strongly supports \nextension of this program and looks forward to working with Congress to enact the President\u2019s \nproposal.  \nMaritime Security Fleet:  The Administration objects to section 3504, which could significantly \nreduce the U.S. Government\u2019s oversight of vessels of the Maritime Security Fleet by placing the \nprimary responsibility for ensuring fleet readiness with classification societies, some of which \nare foreign-owned and foreign-controlled.  Since 2013, there have been 27 documented cases of \nnonconformities for lifesaving, firefighting, or environmental conditions aboard vessels that \nclassification societies certified; of these, 55 percent were discovered by the Coast Guard after \ncertification and directed back to the classification society for remediation.  By restricting the \nSecretary\u2019s discretion to guarantee the fleet\u2019s readiness to carry critical military cargo at all \ntimes, section 3504 would leave the U.S. Government reliant on domestic and foreign \nclassification societies to perform necessary inspections and, by extension, to certify that these \nvessels meet the U.S. Government's requirements for national security operations. \n* * * * * * * \n11  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nJanuary 11, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1644 \u2013 STREAM Act \n(Rep.

Such a needless delay of these important safeguards \nwould impact the communities and economies that depend on clean water and a healthy \nenvironment. \n \nThe current stream protection requirements governing surface mining activities are more than 30 \nyears old and do not incorporate significant advances in scientific knowledge and mining and \nreclamation techniques.

Cochran, R-MS) \n  \nThe Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S. 1558, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other \npurposes.  The Administration supports investments essential to execute the President's national \nsecurity and defense strategies, and appreciates the Committee's recognition that increased \nresources are needed for national defense.  However, the bill drastically underfunds critical \ninvestments in DOD's base budget and instead uses Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) \nfunding for base requirements in ways that leaders in both parties have made clear are \ninappropriate.  Base budget sequestration levels will damage our ability to restore readiness, \nadvance badly-needed technological modernization, and keep faith with our troops and their \nfamilies.  Meanwhile, shifting base budget resources into OCO risks undermining a mechanism \nmeant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts and fails to provide a stable, multi-year \nbudget on which defense planning and fiscal policy are based.  The use of OCO funding to \ncircumvent budget caps in defense spending also ignores the long-term connection between \nnational security and economic security and fails to account for vital national security functions \ncarried out at non-defense agencies. \n \nIn addition, the bill fails to support many of the needed force structure and weapons system \nreforms included in the President's Budget, and undermines a new Base Realignment and \nClosure (BRAC) round that would allow DOD to properly align the military's infrastructure with \nthe needs of its evolving force.  The President's defense strategy depends on investing every \ndollar where it will have the greatest effect, which the Administration's fiscal year (FY) 2016 \nproposals will accomplish through critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, slow \ngrowth in compensation, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The Committee's changes would \nconstrain the ability of DOD to align military capability and force structure with the President's \ndefense strategy, and would require the Department to retain unnecessary force structure and \nweapons systems that cannot be adequately resourced in today's fiscal environment, contributing \nto a military that will be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.  The bill also \nincludes unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay.  If the President were \npresented with S.1558, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.    \n \nEnacting S. 1558, while adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending \nlimits for FY 2016, would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-class \npriorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to threaten \nsuch drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be motivated \nto come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The Republican \nframework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense to the \nlowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts would result in tens  of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, more than two \nmillion fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and thousands fewer \nscientific and medical research awards and grants, adversely impacting the pace of discovery and \ninnovation, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle class, and \nAmericans working hard to reach the middle class.   \n \nSequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only \nthrough pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland \nSecurity, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of \nthe economy and the security of the Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear \nthat he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense \nwithout also fixing non-defense. \n \nThe President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto S. 1558 and any other legislation \nthat implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the investments needed \nfor our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks forward to working with \nthe Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense priorities and offset the cost \nwith commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both \nparties have urged.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Defense \n \nSequestration and Misuse of OCO Funds.  The Administration strongly objects to the \nsequestration-level for the appropriations in the bill for items that were requested in and belong \nin the base budget, as well as the use of OCO\u2014a funding mechanism intended to pay for wars \nand not subject to the budget caps\u2014to pay for $36 billion in base requirements.  Sequestration \nadds risk to our national security by threatening the size, readiness, presence, and capability of \nour military, and threatens the economic security on which our national security depends.  The \nCommittee clearly recognizes that increased investment in defense is needed, but proposes to \nfund it by circumventing instead of increasing the budget caps.  This approach fails to provide \nthe stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning is based; undermines a mechanism \nmeant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts; locks in unacceptable funding cuts for \nnational security activities at non-defense agencies such as the Departments of State, Homeland \nSecurity, and Veterans Affairs; and weakens national security by undermining the Nation's \neconomic security. \n \nGuantanamo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 8100, 8101, \nand 8102 of the bill, which would restrict the Executive Branch's ability to manage the detainee \npopulation at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility.  Sections 8100 and 8101 would \nprohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and for the \nconstruction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the \nUnited States, except in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2016 (NDAA for FY 2016).  Section 8102 would restrict detainee transfers abroad in accordance \nwith the NDAA for FY 2016.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and \nsimilar provisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions.  \nOperating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens our national security by draining \n2  resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent \nextremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive \nBranch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to \ndetermine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and \ncircumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Sections 8100 and 8102 would, \nmoreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles in certain circumstances. \n \nMilitary Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC).  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress and MCRMC to improve our \nmilitary compensation and retirement systems, and encourages the Congress to support the \nadditional recommendations for which the Administration has transmitted legislation.  The \nAdministration strongly supports enacting a Blended Retirement System, which would ensure \nthat 85 percent of servicemembers receive Government contributions toward their retirement\u2014\ncompared to fewer than 20 percent under the current system, provide DOD with better tools to \nrecruit and retain the All-Volunteer Force, and produce significant savings over the long term. \nThe Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress and MCRMC on \nother provisions, to meet our solemn responsibility to ensure that any changes protect the long-\nterm viability of the All-Volunteer Force, improve quality-of-life for servicemembers and their \nfamilies, and safeguard the fiscal sustainability of the military compensation and retirement \nsystems. \n \nCompensation Reform.  The FY 2016 Budget request provides the funding and common-sense \nreforms that will ensure that servicemembers receive competitive pay and benefits and critical \ntraining and equipment.  These proposals would save $1.7 billion in FY 2016 and $18 billion \nthrough FY 2020.  The Administration appreciates the Senate's support of DOD's efforts to slow \nthe growth of basic pay and housing allowances and strongly encourages members of the \nCongress to support all of DOD's requested compensation reforms. \n \nProhibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Round.  The \nAdministration strongly objects to the proposed $10.5 million reduction to funds that would \nsupport a 2017 BRAC round.  This reduction would impair the ability of the Executive Branch to \nplan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would improve military \neffectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the \nBRAC authorization as requested, which would allow DOD to right-size its infrastructure while \nproviding important assistance to affected communities, freeing resources currently consumed by \nmaintaining unneeded facilities.  In the absence of authorization of a new round of BRAC, the \nAdministration will pursue alternative options to reduce this wasteful spending and ensure that \nDOD's limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national \nsecurity. \n \nA-10 Aircraft.  The Administration objects to the additional $467 million for unneeded A-10 \naircraft, which is inconsistent with DOD's fiscal constraints and current priorities.  Funding the \nA-10 above the requested amount puts at risk the future health of the Air Force fighter enterprise \nand $4.7 billion in savings through FY 2019.  DOD needs to focus its resources on the Joint \nStrike Fighter and other multi-mission aircraft, which will replace the A-10's singular mission of \nclose air support while also providing other critical capabilities. \n \nAviation Restructure Initiative (ARI).  The Administration strongly objects to section 8106 of the \nbill, which limits the transfer of AH-64 Apache helicopters to 36 until 60 days after the release of \n3  the National Commission of the Future of the Army report.  This delay in transfers would \nnegatively affect the Army's readiness and ability to prepare and deploy forces for ongoing \noperations.  The FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) established limitations \non the ARI, but provided for the transfer of certain numbers of aircraft in time for congressional \nreview of the report of the Commission on the Future of the Army before transfer of additional \naircraft.  Delaying the transfer until the passage of the FY 2016 NDAA would damage the \nreadiness of Army units in the 1st Infantry Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in October \n2015, the 25th Infantry Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in February 2016, and the 10th \nMountain Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in June 2016.  The remaining combat \naviation brigades would bear the rotational burden of meeting current and projected operational \nrequirements around the world, and would be forced to increase operational tempo and deploy-\nto-dwell ratios for these low-density, high demand units.  The National Guard Bureau has \ndeveloped a plan for the transfer of the first 48 AH-64 Apaches as well as a plan to receive the \nfirst 20 UH-60 Blackhawks.  DOD's plan for the transfer of select numbers of aircraft between \nthe components in FY 2016 is in compliance with the FY 2015 NDAA and is the same as the \nnumber of Apache aircraft (72) that the National Guard Bureau agreed to transfer in its aviation \nproposal.  These new limitations also would likely lead to a significant reduction of AH-64D \ninductions into the AH-64E remanufacturing facility in Mesa, Arizona and affect supporting \nactivities in Huntsville, Alabama, and elsewhere.  The Administration urges the Congress to \npermit the transfer of 72 Apache aircraft in FY 2016. \n \nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF).  The Administration strongly objects to the \nreduction of $1.1 billion of CTPF and the limitations imposed on the Fund, which would \nseverely restrict the flexibility and resources required to empower and enable partners in \nresponding to shared terrorist threats around the world.  For the CTPF to build partner capacity \neffectively, funds need to remain available for two years in order to support the acquisition of \nlong-lead equipment some partner nations require.  Without the needed resources and multi-year \nflexibility, the important security assistance programs begun in FY 2015 would be in jeopardy.  \nThe Administration strongly encourages the Congress to appropriate the $2.1 billion originally \nrequested and remove unnecessary limitations to continue support for CTPF activities in \nFY 2016. \n \nRocket Engine Development.  The Administration strongly objects to the $144 million in \nunrequested and unnecessary funding for a new Government-developed rocket engine.  The \nAdministration is committed to transitioning from non-allied engines; however, an engine-\ncentric approach as provided for in this bill would not preserve the Nation's assured access to \nspace.  While rocket engines are a major component of a launch vehicle, they are only one of \nmany critical components.  Developing a rocket propulsion system independent of the rest of the \nspace launch system risks the Government investing hundreds of millions of dollars without \nensuring the availability of operational launch systems.  Sound systems engineering principles \nand over a half-century of launch vehicle design work demonstrate that a rocket propulsion \nsystem must be developed in conjunction with the rest of the space launch vehicle.  This \nunnecessary funding comes at the expense of more important programs, and would create ripple \neffects across the rest of the budget. \n \nDefense Meteorological Satellite Program.  The Administration strongly objects to the \nelimination of all funding for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-20 and its \nlaunch.  By 2017, only one DMSP satellite will be within its design life.  DOD has certified that \nthis fully-built and recently-refurbished satellite is a cost-effective solution to the expected \n4  shortfall in polar-orbiting weather satellites, which the Government Accountability Office has \nchronicled in its High Risk List.  Because weather satellite data are shared among defense, \nintelligence, civil, and international users, eliminating this satellite would have broad \nimplications, including reduced accuracy of weather prediction models and degraded efficiency \nof surveillance and reconnaissance platforms. \n \nUnrequested Funding.  In this fiscally constrained environment, the Administration strongly \nobjects to the billions of dollars provided for items that were not in the FY 2016 Budget request, \noffset by reductions to higher priority items that the military needs.  Unrequested items include \n$828 million for 10 extra Joint Strike Fighters (after assuming $409 million in uncertain program \nsavings), $1.1 billion to reverse planned savings associated with compensation reform proposals, \n$1 billion of OCO funds for National Guard and Reserve Equipment, $1 billion in incremental \nfunding for an Arleigh Burke (DDG 51) destroyer, $225 million to fund an additional Joint High \nSpeed Vessel, $250 million of Advance Procurement funding for the Navy's amphibious warship \nreplacement program, and $31 million to fund Operation Phalanx.  The Administration has made \nextensive efforts to assess, prioritize, and balance force capacity, capability, and readiness.  The \nFY 2016 Budget supports the defense strategy and rebalances the Joint Force for the Nation's \ncurrent and future security challenges.  The Administration also objects to section 8006 of the \nbill, which places spending on unrequested items into statute. \n \nOperation and Maintenance and Military Personnel Reductions.  The Administration objects to \nthe billions of dollars of undistributed reductions in the bill across the operation and maintenance \nand military personnel accounts.  The operation and maintenance reductions would be applied to \nthose programs that support readiness, depot maintenance, base operations support, and facilities \nsustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions would delay the \nDepartment's full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of maintenance at \nthe military departments' depot facilities. \n \nDefense Health Program.  The Administration strongly objects to the $786 million reduction in \nDefense Health Program Operation and Maintenance funding.  Military medicine has had \ndramatic cost increases in FY 2015, and overall costs are projected to rise.  DOD has taken \naggressive action, where possible, to address these cost increases.  However, ensuring the health \nof the force and their families, along with upholding our commitment to retirees will be \nincreasingly difficult, absent sufficient funding at the level established in the President's Budget \nrequest.  Without funding at the level requested, the Department will be forced to reduce or \neliminate needed medical support programs and initiatives.  \n \nAircraft Carrier Replacement Program.  The Administration objects to the bill's $191.5 million \nreduction to the Department of the Navy's Aircraft Carrier Replacement Program, ship \nconstruction account.  This funding reduction would present unacceptable risk to CVN 80 being \ndelivered on schedule and would result in a significant increase to the ship's cost.  With respect \nto previous Ford-class aircraft carrier funding profiles, CVN 80 incorporates a reduced advanced \nprocurement funding profile thus exacerbating the impact of the proposed funding reduction to \nthis ship.  A delay in delivering CVN 80 would result in unacceptable risk in the Department of \nthe Navy's aircraft carrier force structure by causing a gap that reduces the force level below \ncongressionally mandated requirements. \n \nLittoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mine Countermeasures Mission and Remote Minehunting System \nPackages.  The Administration objects to the proposed $104.5 million in reductions to LCS \n5  Mission Module procurement, including LCS Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Mission Package \n(MP), Remote Minehunting System (RMS), Shallow Water MCM and LCS Common Mission \nModules Equipment programs.  These reductions would leave the programs with insufficient \nfunds to procure needed MCM equipment in the quantity required to deploy LCS with MCM \nMPs in FYs 2018-2020, resulting in a warfighting gap in the Middle East.  The Navy would be \nrequired to extend operations of aging MCM class ships and MH-53 systems at additional \noperating and sustainment expense.  All testing will be completed prior to FY 2016 planned \nprocurements.  The MCM MP reduction would also lead to increased unit costs in component \nmission systems impacting multiple production lines.  The Navy's procurement profiles carefully \nbalance risk to meet testing needs and provide improved MCM capability to the Fleet. \n \nMQ-4 Triton Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.  The Administration objects to the reduction of  \n$152 million from the Triton program that reduces the low rate initial production procurement by \none aircraft in FY 2016 and associated advanced procurement for two aircraft.  In the FY 2016 \nPresident's Budget request the quantity of aircraft was reduced for FY 2016 and FY 2017 from \nfour to three aircraft for each year.  Further reduction of the quantities to two aircraft each year \nwould increase the aircraft cost by as much as 30 percent due to suboptimal economic order \nquantities.  In addition, this reduction would delay Triton Initial operational capability. \n \nJoint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF).  The Administration objects to the elimination \nof the base funding request of $99.7 million.  This funding is critical to the Department's ability \nto quickly respond to urgent operational needs.  Eliminating these funds may directly lead to \nunnecessary risks to servicemembers and their ability to accomplish critical missions. \n \nMissile Defense Programs.  The Administration objects to the $149.3 million in total funding \nreductions to ballistic missile defense programs.  The Administration opposes the $12.3 million \nreduction to the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications program, which is \nneeded to meet the President's European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase III, as well as the \n$22.4 million reduction to the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) program, which \nwould negatively affect the warfighter by delaying delivery of automated engagement \ncoordination between THAAD and Aegis by 12 months.  The Administration also opposes the \nSenate-proposed reduction of $63.8 million to missile defense technology development programs \nand $50.8 million for Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Special Programs that are needed to \nensure the United States stays ahead of future ballistic missile threats.  These reductions would \nsignificantly harm MDA's ability to develop a mid-term discrimination capability, directed \nenergy programs and other classified activities needed to defend friends and allies and address \nevolving threats against the homeland. \n \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \ncontinued support of meaningful launch competition.  For example, section 8045 would improve \nassured access to space and provide significant savings to the taxpayer.  However, the \nAdministration objects to the rescission of $125 million that would eliminate a competitive \nlaunch opportunity in FY 2015.  The Air Force is committed to increasing the number of \ncompetitions and the request for proposal is planned for release in FY 2015.  The Administration \nurges the Committee to support improving assured access to space and allow this competition.  \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration \nappreciates the Committee's support for the DATA Act by fully funding the FY 2016 Budget \nrequest for the Department of Defense to implement the Act.  This funding will support the \n6  Department's efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating \ninformation technology systems, changing business processes, and employing a uniform \nprocurement instrument identifier. \n \nClassified Programs.  The Administration looks forward to providing its views on the \nadjustments contained in the Classified Annex to the bill once it becomes available.  \n \nAdditional Constitutional Concerns.  Several other provisions in the bill raise constitutional \nconcerns.  For instance, section 8071 and language in title IX may interfere with the President's \nauthority as Commander in Chief and section 8009 could interfere with the President's authority \nwith regard to sensitive national security information. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n7  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  June 7, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 4775 \u2013 Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016 \n(Rep.

This \nwould result in people living in areas with unhealthy ozone levels for at least an additional 10 \nyears.  The bill also would unnecessarily extend deadlines for science-based reviews of all \nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) from 5 to 10 years\u2014delaying for 5 years the \nrequirement that the latest science inform our air pollution standards.

The Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort \nthat produced this legislation and wants to work with the Senate and House on a bipartisan basis \nto ensure that important changes are made to protect the most vulnerable students.  The \nAdministration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to \nmake these critical changes to S. 1177 before the bill is presented to the President for signature. \n \nThe Administration supports the commitment in S. 1177 to holding all students to challenging \nacademic standards, maintaining critical provisions that ensure teachers and parents know how \nstudents are performing every year, providing states and school districts with the flexibility \nneeded for schools to improve outcomes for students, and providing additional transparency \naround resource and opportunity gaps.  The Administration appreciates that S. 1177 would allow \nfor critical investments in innovation and what works and excludes harmful provisions that \nwould divert resources away from students, schools, and districts with the greatest economic \nneeds.  The Administration applauds the bipartisan commitment in S. 1177 to expand \nopportunities for America\u2019s children to attend high-quality preschool. \n \nIn order to continue ESEA\u2019s legacy of equity and opportunity for every child in America, the \nAdministration strongly urges revisions during Senate consideration of S. 1177 that would \nstrengthen school accountability to close troubling achievement and opportunity gaps, including \nby requiring interventions and supports in the lowest-performing five percent of schools, in other \nschools where subgroups of students are not achieving, and in high schools where too many \nstudents do not graduate.  Parents, families, and communities deserve to know that when \nchildren fall behind, their schools will take action to improve.  Changes also are needed to \nS. 1177 to ensure that the Department of Education has the authority to implement the ESEA so \nthat it works as intended to protect at-risk students and to provide accountability for taxpayer \nfunds.   \n \nThe Administration also urges changes during Senate consideration of S. 1177 that would cap \nthe amount of time spent annually on standardized testing and that would require parental \nnotification when testing is consuming too much classroom learning time.  S. 1177 should also \nbe improved to better support America\u2019s teachers and principals and to deliver the resources and \nresource equity needed to strengthen our Nation\u2019s schools, including by requiring states to \ndevelop plans to address resource inequities and closing the longstanding \u201ccomparability\u201d \nloophole to provide needed resources to vulnerable students in Title I schools.   \nThe Administration remains committed to working with the Congress on a bipartisan approach to \nreplace NCLB with a law that expands opportunity for all of America\u2019s children.  \n \n*  *  *  *  *  * \n \n2  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nJanuary 12, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 185 \u2013 Regulatory Accountability Act of 2015 \n (Rep. Goodlatte, R-VA, and nine cosponsors) \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they \nare tailored to advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that \nthey minimize uncertainty.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of \nH.R. 185, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2015.  The Regulatory Accountability Act would \nimpose unprecedented and unnecessary procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent \nthem from efficiently performing their statutory responsibilities.  It would also create needless \nregulatory and legal uncertainty and further impede the implementation protections for the \nAmerican public.  This bill would make the regulatory process more expensive, less flexible, and \nmore burdensome -- dramatically increasing the cost of regulation for the American taxpayer and \nworking class families.    \nThe Regulatory Accountability Act would impose unnecessary new procedures on \nagencies and invite frivolous litigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, it must \nalready adhere to the requirements of the statute that it is implementing.  In many cases, the  \nCongress has mandated that an agency issue a particular rule or regulation, and it often \nprescribes the process an agency must follow.  Agencies must also adhere to the robust and well-\nunderstood procedural and analytical requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, \nand the Congressional Review Act.  Furthermore, agency rulemaking has long been governed by \nExecutive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties. These \nExecutive Orders require that agencies promulgate regulations only after considering regulatory \nalternatives, determining that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs, and establishing \nthat the new regulations encourage regulatory flexibility.  Lastly, any final regulation is subject \nto judicial review to ensure that agencies satisfy the substantive and procedural requirements of \nall applicable statutes and consider input from the relevant stakeholders.  \nPassage of H.R. 185 would replace this established framework with layers of additional \nprocedural requirements that would undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory \nmandates.  It would require cumbersome \u201cformal\u201d rulemaking for a new category of rules, for \nwhich agencies would have to conduct quasi-adjudicatory proceedings.  It would require \nunnecessary Advance Notices, beyond the standard notice and comment already required, for a \nlarge number of rules, and other unnecessary procedural steps that seem designed simply to \nimpede the regulatory development process.  It would impose unnecessary new evidentiary \nstandards as a condition of rulemaking.  It would subject the regulatory process to unneeded \nrounds of litigation.  And the Regulatory Accountability Act would undermine the Executive \nBranch\u2019s ability to adapt regulatory review to changing circumstances. \nIn these ways and others, the Regulatory Accountability Act would impede the ability of  agencies to provide the public with basic protections, and create needless confusion and delay \nthat would prove disruptive for businesses, as well as for State, tribal, and local governments.  \nIf the President were presented with the Regulatory Accountability Act, his senior \nadvisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nMay 10, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 4641 \u2013 To provide for the establishment of an inter-agency task force to review, \nmodify, and update best practices for pain management and prescribing pain medication. \n(Rep.

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention show that opioids \u2013 a class of drugs that includes prescription opioid pain \nmedications and heroin \u2013 were involved in 28,647 deaths in 2014.  In addition to high rates of \nprescription opioid deaths, there have also been alarming increases in deaths from heroin and \nsynthetic opioids such as fentanyl.  In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for \nprescription opioids, which is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of \npills.  Further, four in five new heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioid pain \nmedications.  These trends will not change by simply authorizing new grant programs, studies \nand reports.  Congressional action is needed to fund the tools communities need to confront this \nepidemic and accelerate important policies like training health care providers on appropriate \nopioid prescribing, an essential component of this effort. \n \nIn February, the Administration submitted a robust proposal to the Congress to provide \n$1.1 billion in new funding to address this epidemic and expand access to treatment for \nprescription opioid abuse and heroin use to help individuals with an opioid use disorder seek \ntreatment, successfully complete treatment, and sustain recovery.

Luetkemeyer, R-MO, and 39 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5143, the Transparent Insurance Standards Act of \n2016.  This legislation would roll back critical Wall Street reforms intended to protect American \nconsumers and our financial system.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) created important and necessary changes to regulatory \nauthorities and coordination for the insurance industry.  H.R. 5143 would severely weaken these \nreforms, which were put in place to enhance insurance industry oversight in the wake of the 2008 \nfinancial crisis.  The Nation has made great progress as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, and \ncannot allow this bill to hamper the United States' ability to implement the best standards for our \nunique regulatory regime.  The restrictions that this legislation seeks to place on United States \nrepresentatives in international insurance matters under H.R. 5143 would raise serious \nconstitutional concerns and severely outweigh any potential attendant benefits. \n \nFollowing the 2008 financial crisis, and specifically after the near-collapse of American \nInternational Group, Inc. (AIG), the Dodd-Frank Act established a new supervisory and \nregulatory framework to examine financial stability risks in the insurance industry both \ndomestically and internationally.  The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office \n(FIO), which is directed in part to \"coordinate federal efforts and develop federal policy on \nprudential aspects of international insurance matters, including representing the United States, as \nappropriate, in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and assisting the \nSecretary in negotiating covered agreements.\"  The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the scope of \nthe Federal Reserve's supervisory authority so that it now serves as the consolidated supervisor \nof insurance holding companies that own either a Federally chartered thrift or a bank, as well as \nnon-bank financial companies designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  \nFIO, the Federal Reserve, and state insurance commissioners are all actively engaged at the IAIS \nand regularly coordinate with one another, ensuring that each aspect of the unique United States \nregulatory regime is adequately represented in any international negotiation.  Despite their \neffective coordination and extensive work thus far to improve global insurance regulation, the \nrestrictions which H.R. 5143 seeks to impose would stop this work in its tracks and would put in \nplace cumbersome and counterproductive requirements. \n \nH.R. 5143 would purport to prescribe strict negotiating objectives for United States \nrepresentatives in international fora regarding international insurance standards, and establish \nseveral new processes and reporting requirements to be completed before any standard could be \nagreed to.  These requirements would contravene the President's exclusive constitutional \nauthority to determine the time, scope, and objectives of international negotiations.  They also \nwould add significant delays and limitations to the process for developing an international \ninsurance capital standard, ultimately weakening the United States' ability to negotiate \neffectively for standards that best accommodate our unique regulatory regime.   \nSpecifically, under H.R. 5143, FIO and the Federal Reserve would not be allowed to agree to \ninternational insurance standards unless, among other things, such standards are first published in \nthe Federal Register and made available for public comment for 30 days.  If this prohibition \napplied to the mere negotiation and conclusion of such agreements, it would violate the \nPresident's exclusive constitutional authority to conduct international negotiations.  Even \nconstrued to avoid unconstitutional application, this type of requirement would significantly \nimpair U.S. interests at both the IAIS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and limit the \nability of the United States to influence decisions made at the IAIS, which could result in \ninternational insurance standards being adopted that are not in the best interests of U.S. \nconsumers, the U.S. insurance industry, and the U.S. economy.   \n \nFurthermore, H.R. 5143 would require the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Trade \nRepresentative to \"consult with and directly include State insurance commissioners\" in \nnegotiation of written bilateral or multilateral agreements regarding insurance or reinsurance.  \nAlthough the President may choose to permit such consultation and involvement, as has been \ndone already, the President's authority to determine who will represent the United States in \ninternational negotiations is exclusive, and the Congress may not dictate these choices for him.   \n \nFinally, the bill would limit the amount available to the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) through its mandatory Reserve Fund, established by the Dodd-Frank Act.  This cut to SEC \nresources is completely unrelated to international insurance standards and would negatively \nimpact the SEC's ability to fund the long-term information technology initiatives that are \nnecessary to keep pace with industry's increasing use of new and technologically-complex \nfinancial products and services. \n \nBecause this legislation seeks to tie the hands of U.S. representatives, in an unconstitutional \nmanner, and prevent them from effectively negotiating on international insurance matters, the \nAdministration strongly opposes H.R. 5143. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5143, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nApril 21, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 1560 - Protecting Cyber Networks Act  \n(Rep. Nunes, R-California, and 8 cosponsors) \nAn important building block for improving the Nation's cybersecurity is ensuring that private \nentities can collaborate to share timely cyber threat information with each other and the Federal \nGovernment.  In January, the President submitted an updated legislative proposal to the \nCongress with the goal of, among other things, facilitating greater information sharing amongst \nthe private sector and with the Federal Government.  The Administration's proposal provides a \nfocused approach to facilitate more cybersecurity information sharing while ensuring the \nprotection of individuals' privacy and civil liberties.  As the Administration has previously \nstated, information sharing legislation must carefully safeguard privacy and civil liberties, \npreserve the long-standing respective roles and missions of civilian and intelligence agencies, \nand provide for appropriate sharing with targeted liability protections.  \nThe Administration commends the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on its \nefforts to craft cybersecurity information sharing legislation and appreciates its efforts to address \nseveral of the Administration's most significant concerns.  This work has strengthened the \nlegislation and incorporated important changes to better protect privacy.  Several improvements \nto the bill are needed to ensure that it appropriately encourages and facilitates information \nsharing while safeguarding individuals' privacy interests and civil liberties.  As a result, the \nAdministration recognizes the importance of the House and Senate working together to achieve \nthese shared goals and supports House passage of H.R. 1560, so that improvements can be made \nas the legislative process continues. \nWhile the bill has improved significantly, the Administration still has concerns with H.R. 1560's \nsweeping liability protections.  Appropriate liability protections should incentivize good \ncybersecurity practices and should not grant immunity to a private company for failing to act on \ninformation it receives about the security of its networks.  Such a provision would remove \nincentives for companies to protect their customers' personal information and may weaken \ncybersecurity writ large.  In addition, while H.R. 1560 would require that entities take reasonable \nmeasures to remove unnecessary personal information before sharing such information with \nothers, the breadth of the liability protections could provide immunity to entities that are grossly \nnegligent or even reckless.  The bill's language should also ensure that information is not shared \nfor anticompetitive purposes.  The Administration believes that a reasonable solution that strikes \nan appropriate balance can be found.  \nNewly authorized cybersecurity information sharing should preserve the long-standing, \nrespective roles and missions of civilian and intelligence agencies.  H.R. 1560 permits \ninformation sharing with the Federal Government through numerous Federal departments.  \nThe Administration supports authorizing new liability-protected sharing relationships through \nthe National Cybersecurity and Communication Integration Center, a civilian entity within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.  This approach will help protect privacy, provide for  appropriate transparency, and be more effective operationally, enhancing the Federal \nGovernment's ability to quickly integrate, analyze, and use the information to protect the \nNation's networks.  \nH.R. 1560 also authorizes the use of certain potentially disruptive defensive measures in \nresponse to network incidents, provisions that were not included in the Administration's \nproposal.  The use of defensive measures without appropriate safeguards raises significant legal, \npolicy, and diplomatic concerns and can have a direct deleterious impact on information systems \nand undermine cybersecurity.  Moreover, as drafted, these provisions may prevent the \napplication of other laws such as State common law tort remedies.  Though the Administration \nremains concerned that the bill\u2019s authorization to operate defensive measures is not adequately \ntailored, it is committed to working with stakeholders to address these concerns. \nH.R. 1560 recognizes that cybersecurity requires a whole-of-government approach and that \ninformation must be appropriately shared within the Federal Government.  This sharing must be \ngoverned by certain narrow use limitations \u2013 an essential part of overlapping privacy and civil \nliberties protections that also rely on transparent oversight.  The Administration commends the \nCommittee for requiring that intra-governmental sharing be governed by a set of policies and \nprocedures developed by the Federal Government to protect privacy and civil liberties.  The \nAdministration seeks to work with Congress to ensure that other language in the bill regarding \nthe ability to modify such information does not interfere with the Federal Government's ability \nto implement privacy protective policies and procedures.   \nInformation sharing is one piece of a larger suite of legislation needed to provide the private \nsector, the Federal Government, and law enforcement with the necessary tools to combat \ncyber threats.  In addition to updating information sharing statutes, the Congress should \nincorporate privacy and civil liberties safeguards into all aspects of cybersecurity and enact \nlegislation that creates a strong and consistent notification standard for breaches of personal \ndata, as well as legislation that gives law enforcement the tools to fight cybercrime in the \ndigital age.  \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  September 13, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5226 \u2013 Regulatory Integrity Act of 2016 \n(Rep.

The manner by which agencies communicate to the public on regulations and \ntheir associated impacts already is covered by the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, the \nInformation Quality Act, several long-standing Executive Orders, and agency-specific statutes.  \nReporting each and every communication would dramatically increase the cost of regulation to \nthe American taxpayer. \n \nPassage of H.R. 5226 would undermine long-established regulatory frameworks by adding \nunhelpful, duplicative, and burdensome procedural requirements on agencies, while increasing \nthe cost of regulation to the American taxpayer. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5226, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                 \n                                                                                                                         \n                    May 19, 2015 \n                    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1335 \u2014 Strengthening Fishing Communities and  \n \nIncreasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act\n(Rep. Young, R-AK, and three cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1335, which would amend the Magnuson Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), because it would impose arbitrary and \nunnecessary requirements that would harm the environment and the economy.  The MSA \ncurrently provides the flexibility needed to effectively manage the Nation's marine commercial, \nrecreational, and subsistence fisheries.  In contrast, H.R. 1335 would undermine the use of \nscience-based actions to end and prevent overfishing. \n \nThe current requirements of MSA are working \u2013 the percentage of stocks that are subject to \noverfishing and the percentage that are in an overfished state are at historic lows.  H.R. 1335 \nwould interfere with the tremendous success achieved in rebuilding overfished fisheries by \nsetting rebuilding targets that are not based on sound, credible science, and that unnecessarily \nextend the time to rebuild fisheries.  In making these changes, H.R. 1335 introduces a series of \nambiguous provisions that could improperly extend rebuilding periods, delaying the significant \neconomic and environmental benefits of rebuilt fisheries to both fishermen and the Nation as a \nwhole.   \n \nH.R. 1335 would exempt fishery management actions from the requirements for environmental \nanalysis under the National Environmental Policy Act and replace them with a new set of \nstandards.  This provision is unnecessary, as the regional fishery management councils have \nintegrated environmental analyses into an overall framework that is both timely and effective.   \nFor similar reasons, the provisions regarding the Endangered Species Act, the National Marine \nSanctuaries Act, and the Antiquities Act are unnecessary and likely to give rise to confusion.  \nRather than reducing burdens on the fishery management councils, these provisions of H.R. 1335 \nwould interfere with a well-established and integrated system and would create confusion, delay, \nand the potential for litigation. \n \nH.R. 1335 would also severely undermine the authority of the Gulf of Mexico Regional Fishery \nManagement Council by extending State jurisdiction over the recreational red snapper fishery to \nnine miles in the Gulf of Mexico.  This proposed extension of jurisdiction would create an \nuntenable situation where recreational and commercial fishermen fishing side-by-side would be \nsubject to different regulatory regimes.  Absent an agreement among the States as to how to \nallocate recreationally-caught red snapper, the bill would encourage interstate conflict and \njeopardize the sustainability of this Gulf-wide resource. \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to support the Administration's efforts to fully utilize the \nflexibility in the current MSA.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a  proposed rule in January updating key guidelines for implementing the MSA, which would \nameliorate many of the concerns that H.R. 1335 seeks to address without undermining the \nfundamental, science-based requirements of the MSA.  H.R. 1335 would introduce uncertainty \nand delays in rebuilding fisheries, undermine science-based management, weaken the protections \nprovided by other important environmental statutes, and generate sector and interstate conflicts.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 1335, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n  \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nJune 9, 2016 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5278 - Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act  \n (Rep. Duffy, R-WI, and two cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5278, the Puerto Rico Oversight, \nManagement, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which would provide Puerto Rico with \na comprehensive restructuring authority to address its unsustainable debt, coupled with \nappropriate fiscal oversight to increase transparency and achieve meaningful reforms.  \n \nPuerto Rico has already begun defaulting on its $70 billion of debt with a much larger default \nanticipated on July 1 when nearly $2 billion in additional payments are due.  However, this is not \njust a matter of financial liabilities.  The human costs for the 3.5 million Americans in Puerto \nRico \u2013 in terms of access to health care, electricity, education, and basic public safety \u2013 are real \nand escalating daily.  H.R. 5278 would allow Puerto Rico to restructure its liabilities to help \naddress the ongoing crisis, with no new Federal spending.   \n \nWhile the Administration supports passage of H.R. 5278, the Administration has concerns with \nsome provisions in the bill.  The Administration opposes the measures in this bill on minimum \nwage and overtime that put in jeopardy important protections for workers, do nothing to address \nthe crisis, and further exacerbate the economic disparities between Puerto Rico and the mainland \nUnited States.  Although the bill would include important provisions to ensure adequate funding \nfor public sector pensions, it could do even more to protect pensions.  Further, the bill should \nensure Puerto Ricans have a robust voice on the proposed Financial Oversight and Management \nBoard.  While the bill includes provisions the Administration opposes, on balance, the \nAdministration believes this compromise legislation is far superior to the status quo and is \nnecessary to protect the well-being of 3.5 million Americans and create a path to recovery.  \n \nOnly Congress has the authority to provide Puerto Rico the tools to resolve this crisis.  Failing to \nact now will result in an economic and humanitarian crisis far beyond what Puerto Rico is \nalready facing today.  Absent the bill's protections and tools, an escalating series of lawsuits \nbetween creditors and against Puerto Rico could ensue, which could imperil essential services \nand put pensions in jeopardy.   \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to build on the bipartisan effort behind PROMESA and \npass this legislation quickly before this crisis grows materially worse.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n                                                                                                 October 21, 2015 \n                              (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3762 \u2013 Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Price, R-GA) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3762.  The House now has \nattempted to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times.  By repealing \nnumerous key elements of current law, H.R. 3762 would take away critical benefits and health \ncare coverage from hard-working middle-class families.  The bill also would remove policies \nthat are expected to help slow the growth in health care costs and that have improved the \nquality of care patients receive.  H.R. 3762 would increase the deficit in the long term and \ndetract from the work the Congress could be doing to foster job creation and economic \ngrowth.  \n \nThe Affordable Care Act is working and is fully integrated into an improved American health \ncare system.  Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is a thing of the past.  And \nunder the Affordable Care Act, we've seen the slowest growth in health care prices in nearly \n50 years, benefiting all Americans.  \n \nRepealing key elements of the Affordable Care Act would result in millions of individuals \nremaining uninsured or losing the insurance they have today.  An estimated 17.6 million \nAmericans gained coverage as several of the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions have \ntaken effect \u2013 15.3 million since the beginning of the first open enrollment in \nOctober 2013.  This legislation would roll back coverage gains and would cost millions of \nhard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage they deserve. \n \nRepealing the health care law would have implications far beyond these Americans who have or \nwill gain insurance.  More than 150 million Americans with employer-based insurance would be \nat risk of higher premiums and lower wages, or losing their coverage altogether.  Reforms that \nstrengthen Medicare's long-term finances also would be repealed, likely making Medicare's \nHospital Insurance Trust Fund insolvent earlier.  H.R. 3762 also would defund the Prevention \nand Public Health Fund, which was created to help prevent disease, detect it early, and manage \nconditions before they become severe; limit women's health care choices; and disproportionately \nimpact low-income individuals. \n \nRather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal basic protections that \nprovide security for the middle class, Members of the Congress should be working together to \ngrow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3762, he would veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                                                                                                 September 16, 2015 \n                              (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3134 \u2013 Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 \n(Rep.

Planned Parenthood uses both Federal and non-Federal funds to provide a range of \nimportant preventive care and health services, including health screenings, vaccinations, and \ncheck-ups to millions of men and women who visit their health centers annually.

By eliminating Federal funding for a \nmajor provider of health care, H.R. 3134 would limit access to health care for men, women, and \nfamilies across the Nation, and would disproportionately impact low-income individuals.   \n \nH.R. 3504 would impose new legal requirements related to the provision of abortion services \nin certain circumstances, which would likely have a chilling effect, reducing access to care. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3134 or H.R. 3504, he would veto them. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n                                                                                                                        July 27, 2015 \n                    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 427 \u2013 Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Young, R-IN, and 171 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, and \ntailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner.  Accordingly, \nthe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 427, the Regulations from the \nExecutive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015, which would impose an unprecedented requirement \nthat a joint resolution of approval be enacted by the Congress before any major rule of an \nExecutive Branch agency could have force or effect.  This radical departure from the \nlongstanding separation of powers between the Executive and Legislative branches would delay \nand, in many cases, thwart implementation of statutory mandates and execution of duly-enacted \nlaws, create business uncertainty, undermine much-needed protections of the American public, \nand cause unnecessary confusion. \n \nThere is no justification for such an unprecedented requirement.  When a Federal agency \npromulgates a major rule, it must already adhere to the particular requirements of the statute that \nit is implementing and to the constraints imposed by other Federal statutes and the Constitution. \nIndeed, in many cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the particular rule.  The \nagency must also comply with the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act \n(5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.).  When an agency issues a major rule, it must perform analyses of benefits \nand costs, analyses that are typically required by one or more statutes (such as the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act) as well \nas by Executive Orders 12866 and 13563. \n \nIn addition, this Administration has already taken numerous steps to reduce regulatory costs and \nto ensure that all major regulations are designed to maximize net benefits to society.  Executive \nOrder 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, public participation, harmonization of \nrulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a regulatory retrospective \nreview.  In addition, Executive Order 13610 further institutionalizes retrospective review by \nrequiring agencies to report regularly on the ways in which they are identifying and reducing the \nburden of existing regulations.  Finally, agency rules are subject to the jurisdiction of Federal \ncourts. \n \nMoreover, for the past 19 years, the Congress itself has had the opportunity, under the \nCongressional Review Act of 1996, to review on an individual basis the rules \u2013 both major and \nnon-major \u2013 that Federal agencies have issued. \n \nBy replacing this well-established framework with a blanket requirement of Congressional \napproval, H.R. 427 would throw all major regulations into a months-long limbo, fostering \nuncertainty and impeding business investment that is vital to economic growth.  Maintaining an \nappropriate allocation of responsibility between the two branches is essential to ensuring that the  Nation's regulatory system effectively protects public health, welfare, safety, and our \nenvironment, while also promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job \ncreation. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 427, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "April 28, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 2029 \u2013 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2016 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2029, making appropriations for \nmilitary construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. The bill fails to fully fund critical priorities, \nincluding veterans' medical care and military and VA construction.  Furthermore, the legislation \nincludes a highly problematic ideological rider that would constrain the President's ability to \nprotect our national security.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2029, his senior advisors \nwould recommend that he veto the bill. \nMoreover, enacting H.R. 2029 while adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall \nspending limits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments \nin middle-class priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was \nsupposed to threaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that \npolicymakers would be motivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, \nbalanced reforms. The Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both \ndefense and non-defense for FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the \nPresident's Budget, the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable \nchildren losing access to Head Start, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training \nand employment services, and thousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and \ngrants, adversely impacting the pace of discovery and innovation, along with other impacts that \nwould hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle \nclass.   \nMaintaining sequestration would also negatively impact programs that provide important \nservices to our Nation's veterans and are funded in appropriations bills where House Republicans \npropose to make even deeper cuts relative to the President's Budget than in H.R. 2029.  For \nexample, American Job Centers serve 1.2 million veterans annually, including 300,000 who \nreceive intensive employment services.  Transition assistance provides 200,000 service members \neach year with employment guidance and information as they prepare to enter the civilian \nworkforce.  And hundreds of thousands of veterans rely on a wide range of Department of \nHousing and Urban Development programs for housing support and homeless assistance each \nyear.   \nSequestration levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only through \npressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland Security, \nand other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of our  economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear that \nhe is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense \nwithout also fixing non-defense.   \n \nThe President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2029 and any other \nlegislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the \ninvestments we need for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense \npriorities and to offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as \nMembers of Congress from both parties have urged. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nVeterans Affairs Medical Care.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for our \nNation's veterans; however, the Administration objects to the Committee's overall $585 million \nreduction to the FY 2016 Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Care request.  If enacted, this reduction \nwould negatively impact medical care services for tens of thousands of veterans and reduce VA's \nability to activate new and replacement facilities with sufficient staff and equipment and to \nadequately maintain facility infrastructure.   \n \nVeterans Affairs Construction.  The Administration objects to the Committee's $582 million \nreduction to the FY 2016 VA major construction request.  This reduction would prevent building \nupgrades and renovations, including necessary expansions to medical facilities and national \ncemeteries that would improve services to our veterans.  The bill would significantly constrain \nVA's ability to make progress on its highest priority capital projects.  \n \nOther Veterans Affairs Reductions.  The Administration also objects to the Committee's other \nreductions to the overall VA request, including $159 million in reductions for employee awards, \nbonuses, and the President's proposed 1.3 percent pay raise for Federal employees.  As VA \nattempts to enhance staffing to deliver better care to veterans, these reductions will hinder the \nDepartment's ability to recruit and retain personnel critical to the provision of benefits and \nservices to veterans.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the proposed 1.3 percent \npay increase for Federal civilian employees.  \n \nMilitary Construction.  The Administration objects to the Committee's underfunding of military \nconstruction in the President's FY 2016 base defense budget by $1.3 billion, which will delay or \ndefer projects that serve critical needs for members of our Armed Forces and their families.  The \nprojects requested in the FY 2016 Budget reflect the highest priority projects for the Department \nof Defense, and the Administration requests full funding for each project.   \n \nOverseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Funds.  The Administration strongly objects to the \nCommittee's use of $532 million of OCO funds intended for wars and not subject to the budget \ncaps to pay for long-term infrastructure investments.  Shifting long-term defense costs to OCO is \nbad budget policy and bad defense policy, since it undermines long-term planning.  Moreover, \nthe Administration has made clear that it will not accept attempts to fix defense without non-\ndefense by using OCO as a mechanism to evade the defense budget cap.  \n2 \n   \nDetainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to section 512 of the bill, which prohibits \nthe use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house \nindividuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This provision would constrain the \nflexibility that the Nation's Armed Forces and counterterrorism professionals need to best protect \nU.S. national security, intruding upon the Executive Branch's ability to carry out its mission.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3 \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  May 23, 2016 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nHouse Amendment to the Senate Amendment  \nto H.R. 2576 \u2013 TSCA Modernization Act of 2015 \n(Rep.

The bill is a clear improvement over the current TSCA and represents a historic \nadvancement for both chemical safety and environmental law.  \n \nConsistent with the Administration's 2009 Principles for TSCA Reform, this bill would address \nflaws in current law that have limited the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ability to \nprotect public health and the environment from chemical risks.  These important changes \ninclude:  (1) requiring EPA to evaluate new and existing chemicals against a new risk-based \nsafety standard that includes explicit considerations for vulnerable populations; (2) empowering \nEPA to require the development of chemical information necessary to support these evaluations; \n(3) establishing clear and enforceable deadlines that ensure both timely review of prioritized \nchemicals and timely action on identified risks; (4) increasing the public transparency of \nchemical information by limiting unwarranted claims of confidentiality and allowing for the \nappropriate sharing of confidential information with States and health and environmental \nprofessionals; and (5) providing a source of funding for EPA to carry out these significant new \nresponsibilities. While not perfect, the bill meets the high goals set by the Administration for \nmeaningful reform and we commend the House and Senate for taking this historic step. \n \nIf the Federal government is to restore public confidence in the safety of chemicals, which are \nused in commerce and are an integral part of the Nation's economy, it is essential that the \nCongress provide EPA with the necessary tools and authorities to effectively assess chemicals \nand regulate risks.  This legislation provides a solid foundation for advancing these goals and \nimproving public health and environmental protection.

R. 1105 \u2013 Estate Tax Repeal \n(Rep. Brady, R-Texas, and 135 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1105, which would add hundreds of billions of dollars \nto the deficit to provide large tax cuts exclusively to the very wealthiest Americans.  \nRepealing the estate tax exclusively benefits just the wealthiest one or two estates out of every \nthousand\u2014which would receive a tax cut averaging more than $3 million each\u2014because current \nlaw already exempts more than $5 million of wealth for individuals and more than $10 million of \nwealth for couples from the tax.  Given these large exemptions, well over 99 percent of \nAmericans, including virtually all small businesses and family farms, do not pay any estate tax.  \nH.R. 1105 would also shift a greater share of the tax burden onto working Americans at a time \nwhen the top one percent already holds more than 40 percent of the Nation's wealth and wealth \ndisparities have risen to levels not seen since the 1930s. \nH.R. 1105 is fiscally irresponsible and, if enacted, would add $269 billion to the deficit over ten \nyears, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.  The bill would worsen the Nation's long-\nterm fiscal challenges, jeopardizing programs and investments important to the middle class and \nnational security.  In addition, H.R. 1105, which was reported by the House Ways and Means \nCommittee on March 25, is inconsistent with the budget resolution passed by the House of \nRepresentatives that same day, which depends on current law estate tax revenues to meet its \npurported fiscal goals. \nH.R. 1105 is even more extreme than the temporary estate tax repeal enacted in 2001.  That \nlegislation provided for a \"carryover basis\" regime to prevent large amounts of accumulated \nwealth from escaping both income and estate tax.  H.R. 1105 contains no such provision.  \nInstead, it leaves in place the largest capital gains loophole in the tax code by retaining \"stepped-\nup basis\" rules that exempt capital gains on assets held until death from income taxes.  The \nwealthiest Americans can often afford to hold onto assets until death, which lets them use the \nstepped-up basis loophole to avoid ever having to pay income tax on capital gains.  By retaining \nstepped-up basis even after repealing the estate tax, enactment of H.R. 1105 would not only add \nhundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit to provide huge tax cuts to the most fortunate, it \nwould endorse the principle that the wealthiest Americans should not have to pay tax on certain \nforms of income at all.  By contrast, the President's Budget would repeal the stepped-up basis \nloophole.  \nThe Administration has consistently supported tax relief for middle-class and working families.  \nThe President's FY 2016 Budget proposes tax credits that allow paychecks to go further in \ncovering the cost of child care, college, and a secure retirement, and would create and expand tax \ncredits that support and reward work.  In addition, it would invest in accelerating and sharing \neconomic growth through education, research, infrastructure, and help for working families.  The \nPresident's proposals are fully paid for, primarily by closing tax loopholes for the highest-income  Americans.  The Administration wants to work with the Congress on fiscally responsible tax \nrelief for middle-class and working Americans.  However, H.R. 1105 represents the wrong \napproach to the Nation's fiscal and economic challenges.  If the President were presented with \nH.R. 1105, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n  June 23, 2015 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2822 \u2014 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2016 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2822, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of the Interior, Environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The bill drastically underfunds core Department of \nthe Interior programs as well as the Environmental Protection Agency's operating budget, which \nsupports nationwide protection of human health and our vital air, water and land resources.  \nFunding levels in the bill would prevent investments that reduce future costs to taxpayers by \nfacilitating increased energy development and maintaining facilities and infrastructure in national \nparks, refuges, forests, public lands, and Indian Country.  They would make it harder for States \nand businesses to plan and execute changes that would decrease carbon pollution and address the \nchallenges the Nation faces from climate change.  They would also reduce support for \npartnerships and effective collaboration with States, local governments and private entities on  \nefforts to restore and conserve natural resources.  Further, the bill includes numerous highly \nproblematic ideological provisions that have no place in funding legislation.  These provisions \nthreaten to undermine the ability of States and communities to address climate change and \nprotect a resource that is essential to America's health\u2014clean water, as well as the most basic \nprotections for America's special places and the people and wildlife that rely on them.  If the \nPresident were presented with H.R. 2822, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the \nbill.  \n \nEnacting H.R. 2822 and adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending \nlimits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-\nclass priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to \nthreaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be \nmotivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The \nRepublican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense \nfor FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts \nwould result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head \nStart, millions fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and drastic cuts to \nresearch awards and grants, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle \nclass, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.  \n \nSequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only \nthrough pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland \nSecurity, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of \nour economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear \nthat he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense \nwithout also fixing non-defense.     \nThe President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2822 and any other \nlegislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the \ninvestments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense \npriorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members \nof Congress from both parties have urged.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill.  \n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n \nEPA Operating Budget.  The Administration disagrees strongly with the bill's reduction to EPA's \noperating budget by $474 million, or 13 percent, compared to the FY 2016 Budget request.  This \nreduced level of funding would significantly undermine implementation of the Clean Power Plan \nand the recently finalized Clean Water Rule.  The Clean Power Plan is a flexible and practical \napproach to addressing the risks of climate change by reducing carbon pollution from the electric \npower sector, the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States.  Climate change is not \nonly an environmental challenge, it is also an economic, public health, and national security \nchallenge.  Unabated climate change is projected to hamper economic growth in the United \nStates and put the health and well-being of the Nation at risk from extreme weather events, \nwildland fire, poor air quality, and illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease carriers such \nas mosquitos and ticks.  Failing to address climate change would also exacerbate poverty and \ncontribute to environmental degradation in developing countries, potentially resulting in resource \nshortages, political instability, and conflict.  Meanwhile, the bill also reduces funding to \nimplement the recently finalized Clean Water Rule that would ensure waters protected under the \nClean Water Act are more precisely defined and predictably determined.  By delaying \nimplementation of this rule, business and industry face a more costly, difficult, and slower \npermitting process. \n \nState Categorical Grants.  The Administration opposes the $118 million reduction to State and \nTribal Categorical grants compared to the FY 2016 Budget request.  Often, States and Tribes \nimplement environmental programs through delegated authorities.  However, the bill reduces \nthese grants to States and Tribes to carry out activities such as water quality permitting, air \nmonitoring, and hazardous waste management programs.  In addition, the bill reduces funding \nfor brownfields projects by $35 million, or 32 percent, from the FY 2016 Budget request.  This \nreduced level of funding severely limits opportunities for local communities to revitalize their \ncontaminated lands to improve environmental quality and spark economic redevelopment. \n \nState Revolving Funds (SRFs).  The Administration objects to the funding levels provided for \nEPA's Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs.  The bill reduces SRF funding by a combined \n$527 million from the FY 2016 Budget request, reducing necessary support to help communities \nfinance water infrastructure improvements, resulting in approximately 200 fewer projects being \nfunded nationally. \n \nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Limits for Power Plants.  The Administration strongly objects to section \n428 of the bill, which would prohibit the use of funds to propose, finalize, implement or enforce \ncarbon pollution standards for fossil fuel-fired electric generating units that are the largest source \n2  of carbon pollution in the United States.  The bill seeks to derail Administration efforts to \naddress under section 111 of the Clean Air Act the urgent economic, public health, and national \nsecurity impacts of unabated climate change.  Failure to reduce the utility sector's carbon \nfootprint places the Nation at risk from extreme weather events, wildland fire, poor air quality, \nglobal instability, accelerated environmental degradation, and illnesses transmitted by food, \nwater, and disease carriers such as mosquitos and ticks. \n \nClean Water Act (CWA).  The Administration believes that the CWA provisions in the bill \nundermine efforts to protect America's clean water resources, which are critical to American \nfamilies and businesses.  The Administration strongly objects to section 422 of the bill in \nparticular, which would disrupt the Administration's current efforts to clarify the scope of CWA, \nhamstring future regulatory efforts, and create significant ambiguity regarding existing \nregulations and guidance. \n \nSocial Cost of Carbon (SCC).  The Administration regards the SCC as an essential component of \nthe environmental rulemaking process and opposes the Congress' interference with the \nInteragency Working Group's (IWG) development of the SCC.  The Administration strongly \nobjects to section 437 of the bill, which would force the IWG to revise the SCC using only the \ndiscount rates and \"domestic\" SCC values stated in Executive Order 12866 and Office of \nManagement and Budget Circular A-4.  This revision would ignore the trans-boundary \nmovement of carbon, fail to capture key costs of carbon emissions, and disrupt dozens of \nupcoming rules that would use the SCC to monetize carbon reduction benefits. \n \nLimitations on Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program under the Clean Air Act \n(CAA).  The Administration objects to section 435 of the bill, which would block the finalization, \nimplementation, and enforcement of a rule to prohibit certain uses of climate super-pollutants \nknown as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).  Domestic action to reduce use of HFCs is consistent with \nU.S. advocacy for addressing HFCs on a global basis, such as through an amendment to the \nMontreal Protocol.   \n \nNational Ocean Policy.  The Administration objects to section 425 of the bill, which prohibits \nany funding provided in the bill from being used to implement the marine planning components \nof the National Ocean Policy.  This provision would prohibit the Department of the Interior \n(DOI) and EPA from participating in marine and coastal planning efforts, a process to better \ndetermine how the ocean, the Nation's coasts, and the Great Lakes are managed in an efficient \nmanner. \n \nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) \nFinancial Assurance.  The Administration objects to section 427 of the bill, which prohibits the \nuse of funds to develop, propose, finalize, and implement financial responsibility requirements \nunder CERCLA 108(b).  On May 19, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit ordered EPA to develop an expedited schedule for financial responsibility rules \nfor the hardrock mining industry and for three other industries.  This provision would severely \nlimit EPA's ability to develop these rules in a timely manner and abrogates EPA's responsibilities \nlaid out in CERCLA 108(b). \n \nClassification of Forest Biomass Fuels as Carbon-Neutral.  The Administration objects to the \nbill's representation of forest biomass as categorically \"carbon-neutral.\"  This language conflicts \nwith existing EPA policies on biogenic CO  and interferes with the position of States that do not \n2\n3  apply the same policies to forest biomass as other renewable fuels like solar or wind.  This \nlanguage stands in contradiction to a wide-ranging consensus on policies and best available \nscience from EPA's own independent Science Advisory Board, numerous technical studies, \nmany States, and various other stakeholders. \n \ne-Manifest.  The Administration objects to the elimination of funding for e-Manifest \ndevelopment, EPA's system for electronically tracking the transport of hazardous waste.  While \nthe Administration acknowledges the concern about the pace of development of the e-Manifest, \neliminating the requested $7 million in funding at this time would jeopardize EPA's ongoing \nprogress to develop the system and begin operations in the coming years. \n \nLead Test Kits.  The Administration objects to section 426 of the bill that would disrupt EPA's \ncurrent activities under the 2008 Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting rule until EPA approves \na commercially available \"improved\" lead paint test kit.  This provision would undermine EPA's \nefforts to protect sensitive populations from exposure to lead, a known toxin to children and \ndeveloping fetuses, during home renovation projects. \n \nDepartment of the Interior (DOI)  \n \nBureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Topline.  The Administration opposes the $159 million, or  \n5 percent, reduction to BIA as compared to the FY 2016 Budget request.  This funding level \nwould limit DOI's ability to make key investments in education and wrap-around services to \nsupport Native youth, eliminating all increases to post-secondary scholarships and $10 million \nfor education program enhancement funds to allow Bureau of Indian Education to drive school \nimprovement and reforms.  The bill reduces funding for initiatives aimed at supporting tribal \nself-determination through the creation of a one-stop portal to facilitate access to Federal \nresources and funding to address data gaps in Indian Country, and the creation of an Office of \nIndian Affairs Policy, Program Evaluation, and Data to support effective, data-driven, tribal \npolicy making and program implementation.  In addition, this bill eliminates all increases to \nnatural resources management on tribal lands, including funds to help tribal communities prepare \nfor and respond to the impacts of climate change. \n \nNational Park Service (NPS) Centennial.  The Administration opposes funding levels provided \nfor the NPS Centennial.  The bill fails to provide adequate funding to prepare for the Centennial \nin 2016, resulting in the delay of roughly 70 percent of line-item park construction projects and \n36 percent of repair and rehabilitation projects, and forgoes millions in matching private \ndonations.  The bill also fails to provide funding for engaging youth and cultivating the next \ngeneration of conservation-minded individuals, including funding for transportation assistance to \nstudents from Title I schools. \n \nOnshore Inspection Fees.  The bill does not include a proposal in the FY 2016 Budget request to \ninstitute a new onshore oil and gas inspection fee program.  The proposal, which is similar to the \nprogram already in place for offshore operations, would cover the cost of inspection activities \nand reduce the net cost to taxpayers of operating the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) oil \nand gas program.  Failure to adopt the new fees and associated funding would hamper the BLM's \nability to protect human safety, conserve energy resources, facilitate the proper reporting of oil \nand gas production, and ensure environmental requirements are being followed in all phases of \ndevelopment. \n \n4  State and Tribal Wildlife Grants.  The Administration opposes the 15 percent reduction to State \nand Tribal Wildlife Grants compared to the FY 2016 Budget request.  This important program \nallows States and Tribes, key partners in conservation, to strategically protect wildlife and \nconserve habitat in a way that complements Federal investments and yields better results for the \npublic. \n \nPayments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT).  The bill provides $452 million for PILT, which the \nAdministration has proposed to fund through a separate mandatory appropriation in line with its \nprevious congressional enactment.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee's \nsupport for PILT, inclusion of these funds in the bill comes at the expense of all other programs \nfunded by the bill. \n \nCarcieri Land into Trust.  The bill fails to include the provision in the FY 2016 Budget request \nto clarify and reaffirm the Secretary of the Interior's authority to acquire land in trust under the \nIndian Reorganization Act (IRA).  In Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 397 (2009), the Supreme \nCourt held that the Secretary could acquire land in trust under the IRA only for tribes that were \n\"under Federal jurisdiction\" in 1934.  A legislative solution would help achieve the goals of the \nIRA and tribal self-determination by clarifying that DOI\u2019s authority under the law applies to all \ntribes, whether recognized in 1934 or after.  Such legislation would be consistent with the \nlongstanding policy of assisting Tribes in establishing and protecting a land base sufficient to \nallow them to provide for the health, welfare, and safety of tribal members, and in treating all \ntribes equally for purposes of setting aside lands for tribal communities.  \n \nHydraulic Fracturing:  Section 439 of the bill would block DOI from implementing, \nadministering or enforcing the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s recently-finalized Hydraulic \nFracturing rule.  This would leave the agency reliant on 30-year old requirements and prevent it \nfrom taking key steps to improve the safety of oil and gas drilling activities and \nimprove opportunities for BLM to coordinate standards and processes with States and Tribes to \nreduce administrative costs and improve efficiency. \n \nStream Buffer Regulation.  Section 423 would prohibit DOI's Office of Surface Mining, \nReclamation, and Enforcement from updating 30-year-old stream protection regulations to \nreflect modern science and technology and better protect people and the environment, provide \nindustry more certainty, and address recent court decisions. \n \nHunting, Fishing and Recreational Shooting.  Sections 421 and 424 would substantially impair \nthe enforcement of a longstanding ban on the use of lead ammunition in the hunting of migratory \nwaterfowl, and would complicate in other ways the overall implementation of hunting, fishing, \nand recreational shooting on public lands. \n \nWildlife Trafficking.  Section 120 would interfere with ongoing Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) \nactions to combat wildlife trafficking, curb the poaching of African Elephants, and restrict trade \nin ivory, which would impair U.S. leadership in the global fight against ivory poaching. \n \nEndangered Species Act Restrictions.  Sections 117, 121, and 122 of the bill undercut the \nEndangered Species Act by limiting the ability of the FWS to properly protect, based on the best \navailable science, a number of species, including the greater sage grouse, northern long-eared \nbat, and certain gray wolf populations.  Language provisions, like those affecting the sage \n5  grouse, would only create additional uncertainty and undermine unprecedented efforts to \nconserve the sagebrush landscape and the Western way of life. \n \nFederal Acknowledgement of American Indian Tribes.  Language under the heading \"Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, Administrative Provisions\" in the bill would block DOI from finalizing, \nimplementing, administering, or enforcing the Administration's proposed Federal \nacknowledgment rule, preventing DOI's effort to improve the regulations governing the process \nand criteria by which the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges an Indian Tribe. \n \nDOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service \n \nLand and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).  The Administration objects to the drastic \nreduction of $152 million, or 38 percent, to the requested discretionary funding for DOI and \nUSDA LWCF programs.  LWCF is a cornerstone of Federal conservation and recreation \npreservation efforts.  This funding level would severely impede agency capacity to further \nprotect our Nation's natural heritage.  To date, the LWCF has contributed to the protection of key \npublic lands, such as Rocky Mountain National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and portions \nof the Appalachian Trail, among others, as well as State and local recreation projects and \nimportant cultural heritage sites. \n \nWildland Fire Suppression.  The Administration's cap adjustment for wildfire suppression was \nnot included in this bill.  Continued inaction on this proposal, which has bipartisan support, \nwould increase the likelihood of disruptive funding transfers for suppression and away from the \nvery restoration and fire risk reduction programs that are meant to restore landscapes and reduce \nsuppression costs and restore landscapes. \n \nLand Management Operations.  The Administration opposes the $502 million, or  \n8 percent, reduction to operational funding to land management agencies, relative to the FY 2016 \nBudget request.  This reduction would undermine support for the provision of basic public and \nbusiness services that support the long-term health and resilience of national parks, forests, \nrefuges, and other public lands. \n \nWater Rights on Federal Land.  Section 434 prohibits agencies from conditioning land use \nauthorizations on the transfer, relinquishment, or impairment of a water right, or on the \nacquisition of a water right in the name of the United States.  This language is unnecessary for its \nintended purpose, and would preclude land management agencies from protecting the public \ninterest.  The provision would eliminate the ability of land management agencies to maintain \nsufficient water for other congressionally-designated purposes and ensure water rights are tied to \nthe activities for which they were developed.  These restrictions would also hamper cooperative \nwork with land users to improve land conditions, such as range improvements, or conduct habitat \nmitigation activities as part of land use agreements. \n \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service \n \nLand Management Improvements.  The bill provides $357 million for capital improvement and \nmaintenance of the national forest system, a 5 percent increase from the FY 2016 Budget \nrequest.  While the Administration supports the capital improvement and maintenance of the \nNation's public forests in order to increase its health, resilience, and accessibility, the increase in \nthis bill comes at the expense of other needed priorities. \n6   \nDepartment of Health and Human Services \n \nIndian Health Service (IHS) Topline.  The Administration strongly opposes the reduction to \nfunding for Native American health care programs and facilities of the Indian Health Service \n(IHS) by $300 million, or 6 percent, below the FY 2016 Budget request.  This would result in \ninadequate funding for the provision of health care to a population that is sicker and poorer \ncompared to national averages.  For example, compared to the FY 2016 Budget request, the bill \nreduces funding by nearly $50 million for Purchased and Referred Care, a program that supports \nhealth care not available in IHS and tribal facilities, which would exacerbate existing levels of \ndenied care and waiting lists for services. \n \nContract Support Costs.  The Administration objects to the limitation in funding for tribal \nContract Support Costs (CSC) for BIA and IHS.  Specifically, the bill would limit funding for \nCSC that could perpetuate the funding issues described in the Supreme Court's Salazar v. Ramah \nNavajo Chapter decision.  The Congress should pursue a long-term solution for CSC \nappropriations, providing an increase in funding in FY 2016 as part of a transition to a new three-\nyear mandatory funding stream in FY 2017, as proposed in the President\u2019s Budget. \n \nOther Provisions \n \nSmithsonian Institution.  The bill reduces funding for the Smithsonian Institution by  \n$116 million, or 12 percent, below the FY 2016 Budget request\u2014a reduction that can be \nexpected to reduce public access to the Smithsonian as well as increase safety concerns through \ndelays in planned renovations.  With over 30 million visits to Smithsonian facilities recorded in \n2014, it is important to ensure the museums, galleries, National Zoological Park, and nine \nresearch facilities that make up the world's largest museum and research complex remain open, \nmaintained, and available to the generations of Americans who make use of this unique \ninstitution each year.  Specifically, the bill reductions would delay renovation for the National \nAir and Space Museum, where the museum has had to establish temporary covered walkways to \nprotect the public from potential falling debris from its facade, and would reduce operating hours \nfor the museums, including the new National Museum of African American History and Culture.   \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the \nCongress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget requests for DOI and EPA to implement the DATA \nAct.  This funding would support efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such \nas updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and employing a \nuniform procurement instrument identifier.  \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 \nBudget requests for DOI and EPA to develop U.S. Digital Service teams.  This funding would \nsupport managing the agency's digital services that have the greatest impact to citizens and \nbusinesses.  \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSeveral provisions in the bill raise separation of powers concerns.  \n \n7  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations \nprocess moves forward.  \n \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n8  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  September 13, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5351 \u2013 Guantanamo Detainee Transfer Prohibition Act  \n  (Rep. Walorski, R-IN, and 67 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly objects to H.R. 5351, which would prohibit the use of funds to \ntransfer any individual detained at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, either to the \nUnited States or any foreign country.  As the Administration has said many times before, the \ncontinued operation of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay weakens our national security \nby draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening \nviolent extremists.  In February, the Administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely \nand responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter \nof our history to a close.  Rather than constructively engage with the Administration on the \nimperative of closing the facility, this bill would seek to prohibit any and all transfers of \ndetainees, even where such transfers are conducted securely and responsibly and to further \nsubstantial U.S. national security interests.  This bill represents an effort not only to extend the \nfacility's operation \u2013 as have the other unwarranted legislative restrictions on transfers \u2013 but to \nbring to a standstill the substantial progress the Administration has made in safely and securely \nreducing the facility's population. \n \nAs the Administration has repeatedly emphasized, detainees are transferred from Guantanamo \nBay only after a rigorous interagency review process assesses, based on all relevant facts and \ncircumstances, that potential receiving countries are capable of successfully reintegrating them \nand implementing appropriate security measures, consistent with our humane treatment policy.  \nThe restrictions contained in this bill would seek to foreclose entirely the Executive Branch's \nability to determine appropriate disposition options for detainees, including to transfer them \nconsistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy, as well as its flexibility to \ndetermine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances of each case \nand our national security interests.  Moreover, by purporting to prohibit all transfers of \nindividuals detained at Guantanamo Bay, the bill would in some circumstances violate \nconstitutional separation of powers principles, and could interfere with the ability to transfer a \ndetainee who has been granted a writ of habeas corpus. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5351, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill. \n \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "April 28, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 2028 \u2014 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2016 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2028, making appropriations for \nenergy and water development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2016, and for other purposes.  The bill drastically underfunds critical investments that develop \nAmerican energy sources to build a clean and secure energy future; develop and commercialize \nthe emerging technologies that create high-quality jobs and enhance the Nation's economic \ncompetitiveness; and improve resilience against current and ongoing climate impacts that \nthreaten our economy, public health, and natural resources.  As a result, it would put at risk U.S. \ncompetitiveness in new markets for clean energy industries such as advanced vehicles, advanced \nmanufacturing, energy efficiency for homes and businesses, and domestic renewable energy such \nas wind, solar, and biomass.  It would also harm efforts to implement the President's nuclear \nstrategy and advance counter-proliferation objectives.  Furthermore, the legislation includes \nhighly problematic ideological riders, including provisions that threaten to undermine our ability \nto protect a resource that is essential to America's health:  clean water.  If the President were \npresented with H.R. 2028, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \nIn addition, enacting H.R. 2028, while adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall \nspending limits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments \nin middle-class priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was \nsupposed to threaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that \npolicymakers would be motivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, \nbalanced reforms.  The Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both \ndefense and non-defense for FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the \nPresident's Budget, the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable \nchildren losing access to Head Start, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training \nand employment services, and thousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and \ngrants, adversely impacting the pace of discovery and innovation, along with other impacts that \nwould hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle \nclass.   \nSequestration levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only through \npressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland Security, \nand other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of our \neconomy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear that \nhe is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense \nwithout also fixing non-defense.     \nThe President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2028 and any other \nlegislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the \ninvestments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense \npriorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members \nof Congress from both parties have urged.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) \n \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Administration strongly objects to the \n$1.6 billion provided in the bill for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  \nOverall this level is $1.1 billion below the FY 2016 Budget request.  Relative to the FY 2016 \nBudget request, the bill reduces funding for renewable energy by 49 percent, sustainable \ntransportation by 35 percent, and energy efficiency by 40 percent.  The proposed reductions \nsignificantly underfund critical activities that support the development and commercialization of \nclean energy technologies.  At this funding level, the number of research, development, and \ndemonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs \nwould be reduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement, curtailing solutions to cut \nU.S. dependence on oil and reduce energy waste, and undermining the Nation's industrial \ncompetitiveness in the future global clean energy economy.  The Congress is urged to fully fund \nthe FY 2016 Budget request of $2.7 billion. The Administration is also disappointed that the bill \ndoes not include transfer language necessary to support joint efforts with the Navy and the \nDepartment of Agriculture to develop advanced drop-in biofuels for military applications, a \nprovision included in the FY 2015 enacted bill.    \n \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration objects to the $280 \nmillion provided in the bill for ARPA-E, which is $45 million below the FY 2016 Budget \nrequest.  This funding reduction would impact investments and delay improvements in \ntechnologies that reduce energy-related emissions, increase energy efficiency across multiple \neconomic sectors, and reduce energy imports.   \n \nFossil Energy and Nuclear Energy.  The Administration notes that the bill includes funding \nabove the FY 2016 Budget request in some areas that are already well established in the market, \nincluding for nuclear and fossil energy, and yet makes drastic reductions in those that are most \ncrucial to the Nation's clean energy future and continued U.S. technology leadership.  The \nAdministration encourages the Congress to fund DOE's energy programs at the requested level, \nas this balances the portfolio among items of short, medium, and long-term progress and \npromotes U.S. leadership in these technology areas.   \n \nOffice of Science.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Office \nof Science, the level of funding provided, which is $240 million below the FY 2016 Budget \nrequest, is insufficient to maintain U.S. leadership in high performance computing as the United \n2 \n  States moves into capable exascale systems to support discovery science, national security, and \neconomic competitiveness.   \n \nDisposition of Weapons-Usable Plutonium.  The Administration objects to language in the bill \nthat requires the Secretary of Energy to continue construction of the Mixed Oxide Fuel \nFabrication Facility.  This language is unnecessarily restrictive and would preclude alternative, \nand potentially more cost-effective, approaches to implementing U.S. commitments in the 2000 \nPlutonium Management and Disposition Agreement and its 2010 annex to dispose of excess \nweapons plutonium.  DOE contracted for an independent validation of costs for plutonium \ndisposition alternatives in accordance with congressional mandates.  The results of that analysis \nwill inform the Administration's approach to plutonium disposition.  Information on the first \nphase of that analysis was provided to the Congress on April 21st.  \n \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).  The Administration opposes the $212 million level \nprovided for SPR.  In addition to base program activities, the FY 2016 Budget request of $257 \nmillion includes resources to fund timely replacement of equipment and physical systems, to \nbegin to address the backlog of deferred maintenance activities, and to enhance distribution \nflexibility and reliability.   \n \nEnergy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund \nthe FY 2016 Budget request of $131 million for EIA to support expanded domestic energy data \nand analysis, address critical energy data gaps (including monthly movements of crude oil by \nrail), and increase integration of EIA energy data with Canada and Mexico.  \n \nYucca Mountain.  The Administration objects to the funding provided in the bill for Yucca \nMountain and is disappointed with the rejection of the practical solutions proposed in the \nPresident's nuclear waste strategy.  As reflected in the FY 2016 Budget request, this strategy \nincorporates important and workable elements, such as consent-based siting, interim storage of \nwaste, and program funding reforms that are essential to the success of a Nuclear Waste \nProgram.   \n \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, Yucca Mountain.  The Administration objects to the funding \nprovided in the bill for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue adjudication of the \nYucca Mountain license application.   \n \nOffice of the Federal Coordinator (OFC) for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects.  The \nAdministration appreciates full funding for the OFC at the level of the FY 2016 Budget request, \nbut is disappointed that the statutory amendment proposed in the FY 2016 Budget request is not \nincluded.  The amendment is critical to the OFC's ability to fulfill its mission under current \nmarket conditions, which have changed the nature of projects being proposed.  \n \nCorps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works (Corps) \n \nOverall Funding.  The bill provides nearly $5.6 billion for the Corps civil works program.  The \nAdministration believes the more appropriate overall funding levels proposed in the FY 2016 \nBudget request would limit wasteful spending on projects that provide a low or marginal return \n3 \n  to the Nation and would avoid reductions in other priority areas, such as protecting the Nation's \nwater resources and important investments in clean energy technologies.   \n \nCorps Regulatory Program.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fund the Corps \nregulatory program at the requested level.  A $5 million reduction in funding would inhibit the \nCorps' ability to issue permits in a timely manner and to protect important aquatic resources, \nwhile undertaking needed programmatic improvements, including implementation of the pending \nClean Water rulemaking.  \n \nClean Water Act (CWA).  The Administration believes that the CWA riders in the bill undermine \nefforts to protect America's clean water resources, which are critical to American families and \nbusinesses.  The Administration strongly objects to section 105 of the bill in particular, which \nwould disrupt the Administration's current efforts to clarify the scope of CWA, hamstring future \nregulatory efforts, and create significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance.   \n \nFirearms Policy.  The Administration objects to section 107 of the bill, which prohibits the \nCorps from enforcing its ban on firearms at a water resources development project.  If enacted, \nthis provision would prevent the Secretary of the Army from using the discretion now provided \nin law to enforce or revise the current Corps policy, based on considerations such as the security \nof critical infrastructure, public and employee safety, and the manner in which the firearm is \ncarried (e.g., open vs. concealed).  Corps rangers are not authorized to carry firearms and do not \nhave full Federal law enforcement authority.    \n \nNational Ocean Policy.  The Administration objects to section 505 of the bill, which prohibits \nany funding provided in the bill from being used to implement the marine planning components \nof the National Ocean Policy.  This rider would prohibit DOE and the Corps from participating \nin marine and coastal planning efforts, a process to better determine how the ocean, the Nation's \ncoasts, and the Great Lakes are managed in an efficient manner.   \n \nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project \n \nOverall Funding.  The bill provides nearly $1.1 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and $9.9 \nmillion for the Central Utah Project.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support \nfor the Bureau of Reclamation water resources program.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n4 \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  November 14, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5982 \u2013 Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2016  \n(Rep. Issa, R-CA, and eight cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they \nare tailored to advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that \nthey minimize uncertainty.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must \nadhere to the robust and well-understood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act, in a manner that ensures \nthat the rulemaking process is transparent and considers the input of stakeholders.  In addition, \nfor decades, agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by \nadministrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate \nregulations, consistent with their statutes, upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify \nthe costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility. \n \nThe Administration continues to be guided by the same rigorous practices and principles used to \ndevelop and review regulations that have been upheld throughout the entirety of this \nAdministration and previous Administrations.  On December 17, 2015, the Administrator of the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs reiterated that the Administration would maintain \nits normal review standards, and instructed agencies to plan and prioritize its regulations in order \nto ensure an orderly review process during the final year of the Administration.  For these \nreasons, H.R. 5982 is intended to solve a problem that does not exist.  \n \nLastly, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) already allows for the Congress to disapprove of \nrules on a case-by-case basis.  Thus, providing for an arbitrary packaging of rules for an up-or-\ndown vote, as this bill does, is unnecessary.  In addition, the bill would expand the scope of rules \nsubject to the CRA such that by the time a vote on a resolution occurs, some of the rules may \nhave been in effect for over a year.  By doing so, H.R. 5982 would create tremendous regulatory \nuncertainty, potentially impose additional costs on businesses, and represent a step backwards for \napplying sound regulatory principles to protect public health, safety, the environment, and other \ncritical aspects of society. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5982, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  July 11, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5631 \u2013 Iran Accountability Act of 2016 \n(Rep. McCarthy, R-CA) \nH.R. 4992 \u2013 United States Financial System Protection Act of 2016 \n(Rep. Royce, R-CA, and 14 cosponsors) \nH.R. 5119 \u2013 No 2H2O from Iran Act \n(Rep. Pompeo, R-KS, and 32 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5631, H.R. 4992, and H.R. 5119, bills that would \nprevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \n(JCPOA).  These bills would undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA \ncommitments by reimposing certain secondary economic and financial sanctions lifted on \n\"Implementation Day\" of the JCPOA \u2013 the day on which the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) verified Iran's completion of key nuclear-related steps. The JCPOA has \nsignificantly constrained Iran's nuclear program, including through the dismantlement of key \naspects of the program, and subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and \nmonitoring requirements.  It is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States to \ncontinue to meet our commitments under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its \ncommitments.   \n \nH.R. 5631 includes provisions that would prevent the Administration from implementing certain \nU.S. sanctions relief commitments under the JCPOA on the basis of non-nuclear related activity \nby Iran.  Specifically, the legislation would require the reimposition of sanctions on individuals \nand entities delisted on Implementation Day, as well as the re-imposition of financial and \neconomic secondary sanctions lifted on Implementation Day, including sanctions on prominent \nIranian economic sectors, such as the petrochemical sector.  In addition, this bill lacks flexibility \nincluding new waiver authorities as has typically been provided for new robust sanctions \nmeasures for continued use of sanctions in furtherance of our national security and foreign policy \nobjectives.   \n \nH.R. 4992 contravenes United States commitments in the JCPOA, as it would reapply secondary \nsanctions on Iran's financial sector by prohibiting permissible financial transactions between Iran \nand the international community that are wholly outside the U.S. financial system.  This would \namount to a harmful and unnecessary overreach, undermining the President's exercise of \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authority.  As the Administration has \nbeen clear, the United States will continue to impose our primary trade embargo on Iran, with \ncertain limited exceptions set forth in the JCPOA, and take robust measures to protect the U.S. \nfinancial system from access by Iran.  However, this bill seeks to directly undermine Iran's \nconduct of banking transactions outside of the United States \u2013 activity that became permissible \non Implementation Day in return for Iran meeting its nuclear-related commitments, as verified by \nthe IAEA.  \n  H.R. 5119 includes provisions that would foreclose the United States from procuring heavy \nwater from Iran in the future.  Removal of excess heavy water from Iran denies Iran access to \nmaterial that could be stockpiled for potential nuclear weapons production while also providing \nthe international market access to an important commodity for research and non-nuclear \nindustries.  As part of the JCPOA, Iran committed to a limit on the amount of heavy water that it \ncould accumulate, but may sell its excess heavy water, further ensuring that Iran does not use this \nproduct to develop material for a nuclear weapon.  The United States does not produce heavy \nwater.  For U.S. industry and research labs, heavy water is a critical material used for biomedical \nand diagnostic research \u2013 such as MRIs and pharmaceutical development \u2013 as well as for \nchemistry, physics and environmental analysis. \n \nThese bills, separately or collectively, thus would impact the continued viability of the JCPOA, a \ndiplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear \nweapon. Dismantling the JCPOA would remove the unprecedented constraints on and \nmonitoring of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime \nagainst Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership and our \ncommitments to our closest allies.  \n \nAs we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, \nthe Administration remains clear-eyed regarding Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile \nprogram, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region. The United States retains \nall of the tools it needs to counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to \ndisrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and proliferation-sensitive technologies.  In \naddition, the United States remains committed to supporting our regional partners' enhancement \nof their defense capabilities and will continue our steadfast vigilance in enforcing multilateral \nexport controls regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).   \n \nContinued implementation of JCPOA commitments by all participants \u2013 including the United \nStates and our closest allies \u2013 is critical to ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain \nexclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States \nand the international community.  \n \nThe President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful \nimplementation of the JCPOA.  If the President were presented with H.R. 4992, H.R. 5119, or \nH.R. 5631, he would veto these bills. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n) \nJune 2, 2015 \n                    (Senate) \nS O A P  \nTATEMENT  F  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nS. 1376 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2016 \n(Sen. McCain, R-AZ) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s continued support of \nour national defense and supports a number of provisions in S. 1376, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, such as authorities that support capacity-building \nefforts with foreign military forces, enable the support of allies sharing common objectives, and  \nfacilitate on-going operations. \n \nWhile there are areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration strongly objects to \nprovisions in the bill that would constrain the ability of the Department of Defense (DOD) to \nconduct multi-year defense planning and align military capabilities and force structure with the \nPresident\u2019s defense strategy.  First, the President has been very clear about the core principle that \nhe will not support a budget that locks in sequestration, and he will not fix defense without fixing \nnon-defense spending.  Sequestration levels will damage our ability to restore readiness, advance \nbadly-needed technological modernization, and keep faith with our troops and their families.  \nUnfortunately, the bill fails to authorize sufficient funding for our military\u2019s priorities in the base \nbudget, and instead uses Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in ways that leaders \nof both parties have made clear are inappropriate.  Shifting base budget resources into OCO risks \nundermining a mechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts and fails to \nprovide a stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning is based.  The use of OCO \nfunding to circumvent budget caps in defense spending also ignores the long-term connection \nbetween national security and economic security and fails to account for vital national security \nfunctions carried out at non-defense agencies.  \n \nFurther, the bill fails to adopt many of the needed force structure and weapons system reforms \nincluded in the President\u2019s Budget, and fails to provide an authorization for a new Base \nRealignment and Closure (BRAC) round to allow DOD to properly align the military\u2019s \ninfrastructure with the needs of its evolving force.  The President\u2019s defense strategy depends on \ninvesting every dollar where it will have the greatest effect, which the Administration\u2019s FY 2016 \nproposals will accomplish through critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, slow \ngrowth in compensation, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The Committee\u2019s changes would \nconstrain the ability of DOD to align military capability and force structure with the President\u2019s \ndefense strategy, and would require the Department to retain unnecessary force structure and \nweapons systems that cannot be adequately resourced in today's fiscal environment, contributing \nto a military that will be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.  The bill also \ncontinues unwarranted restrictions, and imposes onerous additional ones, regarding detainees at \nGuantanamo Bay.  If this bill were presented to the President, the President\u2019s senior advisors \nwould recommend to the President that he veto it.  \n  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these and other concerns, \na number of which are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks forward to \nworking with Congress to address concerns on classified programs.  \n \nSequestration and Misuse of OCO Funds:  The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s \nauthorization of sequester level appropriations for items that were requested in and belong in the \nbase budget and the use of OCO, a funding mechanism intended to pay for wars and not subject \nto the budget caps, to pay for $38 billion in base requirements.  Sequestration adds risk to our \nnational security by threatening the size, readiness, presence, and capability of our military, and \nthreatens the economic security on which our national security depends.  The Committee clearly \nrecognizes that the President\u2019s Budget level for defense is needed, but authorizes it in a way that \nfails to acknowledge the need to reverse sequestration for both defense and non-defense \nspending.  \n \nGuantanamo Detainee Provisions:  The Administration strongly objects to provisions of the bill \nthat would impede efforts to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  As the \nAdministration has said many times before, operating this facility weakens our national security \nby draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening \nviolent extremists.   \n \nWhile the Administration appreciates the additional flexibility provided by section 1034, which \nwould permit the temporary transfer of detainees to the United States for certain medical care, \nother provisions of the bill are more restrictive than existing provisions to which the \nAdministration has repeatedly objected.  Not only would provisions of the bill extend existing \nrestrictions, they would impose additional unwise and unnecessary ones that would further \nimpede efforts to responsibly close the facility.  While the bill would relax certain of these \nrestrictions if Congress approves a plan to close the facility by joint resolution, this process for \ncongressional approval is unnecessary and overly restrictive.  Sections 1031 and 1032 would \nprohibit the use of funds to construct or modify any facility in the United States to house \ndetainees or to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States, except in the limited case of \ntemporary medical transfers authorized by section 1034, until Congress approves a plan to close \nthe facility.  Sections 1033 and 1035 would impose more onerous restrictions than current law \ndoes on transfers abroad and would prohibit certain categories of transfers entirely.  These \nprovisions undermine our national security by limiting our ability to act as our military, \ndiplomatic, and other national security professionals deem appropriate in a given case.  Under \nexisting law, the Secretary of Defense is already required to make a determination that actions \nhave been or will be taken to substantially mitigate risks to the United States or U.S. persons or \ninterests posed by detainee transfers abroad.   \n \nThe President has objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior \nlegislation.  The restrictions contained in this bill are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with \nthe Executive Branch\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its \nflexibility to determine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances \nof each case and our national security interests, and when and where to transfer them consistent \nwith our national security and our humane treatment policy.  Sections 1032, 1033, and 1035 \nwould, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain \ncircumstances, and section 1035 could in some circumstances interfere with a detainee\u2019s right to \nthe writ of habeas corpus.   \n \n2  The Administration also strongly objects to the requirements in sections 1033(b)(2) and 1037, \nwhich would require the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress with diplomatic assurances \nregarding detainee transfers and reports containing such assurances.  Across two administrations, \nthe Executive Branch has consistently informed Congress and represented before U.S. courts that \ndisclosing such diplomatic assurances from foreign governments would have a chilling effect on \nthose countries\u2019 willingness to cooperate on detainee transfers.   \n \nThe Administration objects finally to the additional reporting requirement in section 1036, which \nwould require the Secretary of Defense to submit an unclassified report to Congress on past \ndetainee assessments produced by the Joint Task Force-Guantanamo.  The Administration does \nnot believe this section, as drafted, is a productive measure and will treat this provision, along \nwith sections 1033(b)(2) and 1037, consistent with the President\u2019s constitutional authority in this \narea. \n \nDefense Acquisition:  The Administration strongly objects to section 843 and related provisions, \nwhich are inconsistent with the Secretary of Defense\u2019s exercise of authority, direction, and \ncontrol over all of the DOD programs and activities.  Since DOD\u2019s founding, the Secretary of \nDefense has served as the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to DOD and \nsubordinated the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to the Secretary\u2019s authority.  \nThis provision would undermine this principle by seeking to exclude the Secretary and his \nassistants from certain matters entrusted exclusively to the military departments.  Section 843 \nwould significantly reduce the Secretary of Defense\u2019s ability - through the Under Secretary of \nDefense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics USD(AT&L) - to guard against unwarranted \noptimism in program planning and budget formulation, and prevent excessive risk taking during \nexecution - all of which is essential to avoiding overruns and costly delays.  Program planning, \nmanagement, and execution are already Service responsibilities.  The USD(AT&L) reviews \nService plans at discrete milestones associated with major Department resource commitments to \nensure programs are affordable, executable, and follow sound business and risk management \npractices.  The prohibition on documentation without a determination by the Deputy Chief \nManagement Officer also abrogates the ability of the Secretary and Under Secretary to conduct \nroutine execution monitoring of programs, thus handcuffing their ability to intercede unless and \nonly until notified programs are at risk of failure.  Recent studies from the Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) and DOD\u2019s own performance reports show clear empirical \nevidence of steady improvements in acquisition results since the role of the Under Secretary has \nbeen enhanced in recent years.  DOD is committed to reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and \ncontinuing the important work of improving the performance of its defense acquisition system in \nclose coordination with Congress, including increasing the military Service Chief\u2019s role.  The \nAdministration strongly objects to these provisions because they would not accomplish that goal, \nand would significantly increase the risk of overly optimistic program planning and budgeting.  \n \n \nMilitary Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) \nRecommendations:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for some of the \nMCRMC recommendations to improve our military compensation and retirement systems, and \nencourages Congress to support the additional recommendations for which the Administration \nhas transmitted legislation.  The Administration continues to evaluate how the more complex \nrecommendations of a Blended Retirement System would affect the All-Volunteer Force and \nexpects to provide the Committee with further views on this proposal in the near future.  The \nAdministration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress and the MCRMC on other \n3  provisions, to meet our solemn responsibility to ensure that any changes protect the long-term \nviability of the All-Volunteer Force, improve quality-of-life for service members and their \nfamilies, and safeguard the fiscal sustainability of the military compensation and retirement \nsystems.  \n \nCompensation Reform and TRICARE:  The President\u2019s Budget provides funding and common-\nsense reforms that will ensure that service members receive competitive pay and benefits and \ncritical training and equipment.  The Administration believes it is imperative to slow the growth \nof personnel costs and modernize military healthcare and appreciates the Committee\u2019s support \nfor several of these compensation reforms.  The Administration appreciates the modification of \nTRICARE pharmacy cost-sharing requirements in the bill.  However, among reforms not \nincluded in the bill are other proposed improvements that will modernize the TRICARE \nprogram.  TRICARE remains fundamentally unchanged since its inception in the mid-1990\u2019s and \nis antiquated by contemporary health plan standards.  The Consolidated Health Plan structure \nwould provide DOD with substantial projected savings, simplify TRICARE for beneficiaries, \nand offer participants more freedom to choose providers.  Failing to enact the TRICARE and \nother various reform proposals would compel DOD to take additional reductions in the areas of \nreadiness, modernization, and force structure.  The Administration looks forward to working \nwith Congress on these and other reforms to modernize and enhance the military health care \nsystem.  \n \nCommissary Streamlining and Privatization:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \nefforts in adopting provisions that would strengthen the defense commissary system by treating \ncommissary overseas transportations costs in the same manner as we do domestically and \nallowing the use of commissary surcharges to purchase operating supplies in lieu of \nappropriations.  Currently, the Administration has concerns with commissary privatization and \nthe willingness of private sector entities to participate in such a project.  However, there is an \nindependent study under way to determine whether privatization is a feasible option and we \nshould wait for those results prior to making any policy changes.  In the meantime, the \nAdministration encourages Congress to authorize the Department to pursue an alternative pilot \nprogram, as set forth in our current legislative proposal.  We also strongly encourage Congress to \nadopt the other elements of our proposal as the primary means to offset operating costs and \ndevelop effective commissary business practices without significantly affecting patron savings.  \n \nProhibition on Conducting Additional BRAC Round:  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 2702, which does not authorize an additional BRAC round.  This impairs the ability of \nthe Executive Branch to plan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would \nimprove military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration strongly urges Congress to \nprovide the BRAC authorization as requested, which would allow DOD to right-size its \ninfrastructure while providing important assistance to affected communities, freeing resources \ncurrently consumed by maintaining unneeded facilities.  In the absence of authorization of a new \nround of BRAC, the Administration will pursue alternative options to reduce this wasteful \nspending and ensure that DOD\u2019s limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the \nwarfighter and national security.  \n \nProhibition on Retirement of A-10 Aircraft:  The Administration strongly objects to section 134, \nwhich is inconsistent with DOD\u2019s fiscal constraints and current priorities.  Section 134 would \nrestrict DOD from obligating or expending funds to retire A-10 aircraft and would require a \nstudy by an independent agency focusing on what capabilities should be included in an A-10 \n4  replacement.  The retirement restriction puts at risk needed recapitalization efforts affecting the \nacquisition and manning of the Air Force fighter enterprise.  Additionally, the study specifies \ncapability thresholds that may or may not be valid in future conflicts.  DOD believes the Joint \nStrike Fighter and other multi-mission aircraft will replace the A-10\u2019s singular mission of close \nair support while also providing other critical capabilities.  \n \nLimitations on Retirement, Management, or Acquisition of Aircraft:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to sections 131-133 and 135-138, which are inconsistent with DOD\u2019s fiscal \nconstraints and restrict DOD\u2019s ability to retire, acquire, or transfer weapon systems and aircraft \nplatforms in accordance with current strategic and operational plans.  Air Force management of \nits operational assets across the force is critical.  These sections would limit acquisition, \nretirement or transfer of the following aircraft:  B-1, B-2, and B-52 bomber aircraft; all fighter \naircraft; F-35A fighter,  EC-130 H Compass Call aircraft; C-130H aircraft and associated  \nmanpower; T-1A Jayhawk aircraft; Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft; \nor Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar Systems (JSTARS) aircraft.  Such prohibitions \nlimit or delay savings, efficiencies, and operational capabilities necessary to meet mission \nobjectives in the current fiscal environment.  \n \nAviation Restructure Initiative (ARI):  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1044 and \n1045, which would place new limitations on implementation of the ARI and negatively affect the \nArmy\u2019s readiness and ability to prepare and deploy forces to meet ongoing operations.  The \nNational Defense Authorization Act for FY 2015 (FY 2015 NDAA) established limitations on \nthe ARI, but provided for the transfer of certain numbers of aircraft and time for congressional \nreview of the report of the Commission on the Future of the Army before transfer of additional \naircraft.  The Department\u2019s plan for the transfer of select numbers of aircraft between the \ncomponents in FY 2016 is in compliance with the FY 2015 NDAA and is the same as the \nnumber of Apache aircraft (72) that the National Guard Bureau agreed to transfer in their \naviation proposal.  Sections 1044 and 1045 combined would have a negative impact on the \ncombat effectiveness of three of eleven remaining Regular Army combat aviation brigades by \npreventing the transfer of Apache aircraft in FY 2016 to build the reconnaissance squadrons of \nthe 1st Infantry Division in Kansas, the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, and the 10th Mountain \nDivision in New York.  The remaining combat aviation brigades would bear the rotational \nburden to meet current and projected operational requirements around the world, and would \nincrease operational tempo and deploy-to-dwell ratios for these low-density, high demand units.  \nThese new limitations also would likely induce a 50-to-100 percent reduction of AH-64D \ninductions into the AH-64E remanufacturing facility in Mesa, Arizona and affect supporting \nactivities in Huntsville, Alabama, and elsewhere.  The Administration urges Congress to remain \nconsistent with the FY 2015 NDAA and permit the transfer of 72 Apache aircraft in FY 2016.  \n \nStreamlining DOD Management and Operational Headquarters:  While the Administration \nwelcomes the Committee\u2019s support for DOD\u2019s plan to reduce headquarters personnel and \nspending by 20 percent, the Administration strongly objects to section 351, which would require \na reduction of 30 percent without recognizing reductions that have already been made.  By \nanchoring the reductions on the FY 2015 authorized amounts, the scale and timeline of these \nreductions would preclude DOD from implementing them through streamlining and process \nimprovements.  Instead, DOD would be required to make deep, across-the-board cuts which \nwould undermine critical functions that support the warfighter.  DOD\u2019s execution of then-\nSecretary of Defense Hagel\u2019s Department-wide 20 percent headquarters reduction plan projects \nsavings of $5.3 billion.  These cuts were incorporated into the President\u2019s FY 2016 Budget and \n5  will continue through FY 2019.  Section 351 anchors the cost reduction in DOD\u2019s administrative \noperations and maintenance account, which includes activities other than management \nheadquarters; it is, therefore, an inappropriate basis for cost reduction.  Section 351 contains \nexemptions that would prevent enterprise-wide streamlining efforts, presupposes the priority of \ncertain support functions with insufficient consideration of broader mission needs, and fails to \nrecognize the important functional distinctions between the Office of the Secretary of Defense, \nMilitary Departments, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Combatant Commands that were established \nunder the Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986.  \n \nMultiple Provisions Affecting Space Launch:  The Administration strongly objects to sections \n1603, 1604, 1605, and 1606, which contain provisions addressing contracting and development \nof launch capabilities.  Section 1603 would effectively eliminate the opportunity for meaningful \ncompetition during Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Phase 2 and leave restrictions \nin place that could inhibit DOD\u2019s ability to maintain assured access to space for National \nSecurity Space satellites.  Section 1604\u2019s restriction on the use of an EELV Launch Capability-\nlike arrangement on future EELV competitions is premature because such an arrangement may \nbe required to maintain two families of launch vehicles and support the Department\u2019s mandate of \nhaving assured access to space.  This restriction may also preclude DOD from meeting its \ncommitments from the USG/Space X mediation.  In the event such an arrangement is determined \nto be in the Government\u2019s best interest, it would be applied fairly to all EELV launch service \nproviders.  Section 1605 does not account for the 2-3 year lead time between the procurement \nand launch of the system.  Additionally, there is significant capability variation between single-\ncore and three-core (heavy) launch vehicles.  Finally, the section 1606 requirement for a plan to \ndevelop and field a full-up rocket propulsion system would not, by itself, preserve the Nation\u2019s \nassured access to space.  Developing a rocket propulsion system independent of the rest of the \nspace launch system risks the Government investing hundreds of millions of dollars without \nensuring the availability of operational launch systems.  Sound systems engineering principles \nand over a half-century of launch vehicle design work demonstrate that a rocket propulsion \nsystem must be developed in conjunction with the rest of the space launch vehicle.  The \nAdministration is committed to the same goals for space espoused in the bill -- assured access to \nspace via commercially-viable, competitive, domestic launch providers using U.S.-developed \nlaunch systems for national security space.  Sections 1603-1606 would impede achievement of \nthose goals.  Additionally, section 1605 would interfere with the President\u2019s constitutional \nauthority to recommend to Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.  \n \nCounterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF):  The Administration objects to the reduction of \n$1.1 billion of CTPF because it would severely limit a valuable partnership-focused approach to \ncounterterrorism.  Reducing CTPF precludes DOD from continuing important security assistance \nprograms begun in FY 2015.  The Administration strongly encourages Congress to authorize the \n$2.1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2016.  \n \nOpen Skies Treaty:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1662, which would change \nthe reporting requirement to provide an assessment to Congress on the national security \nimplications of Russian proposals to introduce new or modified sensors or aircraft, from 30 days \nto 90 days prior to the United States certifying the aircraft or sensors.  The 90-days requirement \nis not feasible, as it would allow insufficient time for the U.S. Government to assess the Russian \nproposal adequately and is only 30 days after we would be informed of Russia\u2019s notification of \nintent to certify, and before all analyses are completed.  \n \n6  Missile Defense Programs:  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of \nballistic missile defense programs, the Administration objects to sections 1641, 1642, and 1643.  \nSection 1642 would require DOD to deploy a long-range discrimination sensor by December 30, \n2020, to defend against potential future long-range ballistic missile threats from Iran.  DOD is \nconducting a comprehensive sensor analysis of alternatives, and mandating deployment of a \nmissile tracking radar by 2020 is premature and unfunded.  Section 1643 would require a plan to \ndeploy anti-air warfare capability to the Aegis Ashore sites in Poland and Romania.  If a U.S. \nsolution were implemented, this requirement would entail hardware and software upgrades not \npreviously planned and would introduce additional costs and potentially delay the deployment in \nPoland.  Installing this capability would also require amending previously negotiated agreements \nwith the host nations as well as extensive discussions with our NATO Allies.  Section 1641 \nwould require DOD to provide a plan to accelerate by two years the fielding of a potential future \nContinental United States interceptor site within 30 days of the completion of the ongoing \nEnvironmental Impact Statement.  Consistent with section 234 of the FY 2013 NDAA, DOD is \nalready preparing a contingency plan and believes this added requirement is premature and \ninconsistent with best acquisition practices.  \n \nUkraine Security Assistance Initiative:  The Administration strongly objects to the limitation in \nsection 1251(c)(2), which stipulates that no more than 50 percent of the $300 million in \nauthorized funds may be obligated until at least 20 percent is spent on lethal assistance or \ncounter-battery radars.  This limitation forces the hand of the Administration in providing lethal \nassistance to the government of Ukraine - a decision that should rest with the Executive Branch.   \nForeign Policy and Security Assistance-Related Authorities:  The Administration appreciates the \nbill\u2019s inclusion of several useful foreign policy and security assistance-related authorities.  Such \nauthorities must strike the needed balance between specific defense initiatives and broader \nforeign policy priorities.  This delicate balance can be jeopardized by narrow new assistance \nauthorities that address sensitive issues with profound foreign policy ramifications.   The \nAdministration is currently conducting a review of existing authorities to determine if there are \ngaps that need to be addressed.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress on \nthis effort and on ensuring that any legislation strikes the appropriate balance.  \nRestrictions Imposed on CVN 78 Class Aircraft Carrier Program:  The Administration strongly \nobjects to section 111, which would reduce the cost limitation baseline for CVN 79 and \nsubsequent FORD-class carriers to $11.398 billion.  A $100 million reduction would degrade the \ncapabilities of CVN 79 and follow-on ships or increase the risk of a breach of the cap.  The \ncurrent cost cap represents a significant reduction from CVN 78 and will be challenging to \nachieve.  Further reductions may impact the delivery of integral warfighting capability.  The \nDepartment has worked with the shipbuilder and other system providers to revamp the \nconstruction process for CVN 79 to avoid the cost increases experienced with construction of \nCVN 78.  The Administration also strongly objects to section 112, which would add debilitating \nrestrictions to the construction and cost of CVN 79 by requiring Full Ship Shock Trials (FSST) \non CVN 78 by September 30, 2017.  The three years of detailed planning and preparation \nactivities required to complete FSST would divert engineering resources needed to complete the \nfirst-of-class integrated shipboard test program currently underway on CVN 78.  In addition, any \nfurther delays in delivering the ship would compromise deployed presence and contingency \nsupport, as well as surge capacity, to combatant commanders.  \n \n7  Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and Frigate (FF):  The Administration objects to limitations on \nResearch, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy \nfunding for LCS and FF ships.  Withholding 75 percent of the RDT&E Frigate funding would \nprevent the Navy from completing the necessary design and integration efforts required to \ndevelop technical data packages and proposal.  Withholding funding in support of the Frigate \nwould jeopardize the Navy\u2019s ability to achieve a FY 2019 production contract, resulting in a gap \nin the production lines and additional procurement costs. \n \nU.S. Southern Border Security:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1041 and 4401, \nrelated to the provision of assistance to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Customs \nand Border Protection (CBP).  Section 1041 would require the Secretary of Defense to provide \nassistance to the CBP efforts to secure the U.S. southern border.  This section would supplant \nexisting laws, which authorize DOD support on a reimbursable basis, when necessary, and as \ndetermined by the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nwith a law that mandates DOD support on a non-reimbursable basis, whether necessary or not.  \nThis would leave the Secretary of Defense with no choice but to direct cuts in DOD programs \nintended to provide for the national defense of the United States - a DOD mission - in order to \nfund a DHS mission.  Likewise, section 4401 would add funds in Military Personnel \nAppropriations for additional National Guard support to CBP\u2019s Operation Phalanx.  The \nadditional funding in section 4401 would change this National Guard support into a mission that \nbenefits DHS at the expense of National Guard training requirements. \n \nBasic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for Married Members and Members Living Together:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 604, which would restrict BAH for uniformed service \nmembers who are married to another member and limit BAH for members who choose to share \nhousing with other members.  BAH is a part of every member\u2019s regular military compensation \nand is designed to provide a cash housing allowance.  Section 604 would impose a significant \nmarriage penalty when a member is married to another member.  This section would penalize \nmembers who choose to reside with other members as compared to those members who choose \nto reside alone or share housing with nonmembers.  This action would seem to conflict with the \nfundamental fiscal responsibility required of our service members. \n \nSection 604 will have a disproportionate negative impact on women service members, where 20 \npercent of women on active duty are in a dual military marriage, compared with only 3.7 percent \nof active duty men.  These women will lose significant benefits and support they are owed for \ntheir service to our country.  Section 604 will degrade the culture and environment needed to \nkeep our military open and welcoming to military families and risks sacrificing the strengths they \nbring to our nation\u2019s defense.  Finally, section 604 will have a negative impact on the recruitment \nand retention of the high quality service members, and families, required for our all-volunteer \nforce. \n \nAuditing of Contracts:  The Administration objects to section 878, which would preclude the \nDefense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) from receiving reimbursements from non-Defense \nAgencies, unless the Secretary of Defense certifies that the DCAA-incurred cost backlog is less \nthan 12 months of inventory.  This provision would cause additional burdens on the already \novertaxed staff of the DOD Inspector General, DCAA auditors, and on industry, and would \ndecrease efficiency within DCAA.  In the past three years DCAA has reduced the incurred cost \nbacklog by 90 percent and those reductions are continuing.  The restrictions imposed by this \nsection will not lead to the reductions envisioned and could result in unintended negative \n8  consequences such as having to perform duplicative work and placing more burden on \ncontractors having to deal with more than one audit group. \n \nUnrequested Funding:  In this fiscally-constrained environment, the Administration objects to the \nauthorization of billions of dollars of unnecessary funding offset by equal cuts to higher priority \nitems requested in the President\u2019s Budget.  Unrequested items include $1.15 billion for extra \nF/A-18 aircraft and $1.1 billion for extra Joint Strike Fighters.  The Administration has made \nextensive efforts to assess, prioritize, and balance force capacity, capability, and readiness in \ndeveloping the FY 2016 Budget.  Extra programs inserted in the budget come at the expense of \nprograms that are more important and will create ripple effects across the rest of the budget.  \n \nOperation and Maintenance and Military Personnel Reductions:  The Administration objects to \nthe billions of dollars of undistributed reductions in the bill across the operation and maintenance \nand military personnel accounts.  The operation and maintenance reductions would be applied to \nthose programs which support readiness, depot maintenance, base operations support, and \nfacilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions will delay the \nDepartment\u2019s full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of maintenance  \nat the military departments\u2019 depot facilities.  \n \nNo Entitlement to Unemployment Insurance While Receiving Post-9/11 Education Assistance:  \nThe Administration objects to section 535 because the population of veterans it covers is too \nbroad.  The intent of the MCRMC proposal was to eliminate the dual receipt of unemployment \nbenefits and a housing stipend for veterans receiving Post-9/11 Education Assistance.  However, \nsection 535 would affect every veteran receiving even a minimal amount of assistance through \nthe Post 9/11 GI Bill, such as technology certification, credentialing, and licensing training.  \nState-level unemployment compensation programs already provide guidance regarding students\u2019 \nstatus within the workforce and eligibility to receive benefits.  This could have a disproportionate \nimpact on Reserve Component service members because it could affect both separated and \ncurrently serving Reserve Component members.  \n \nMarine Corps Base Camp Pendleton Raw Water Pipeline Military Construction Project:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to the deletion of this essential project which supports the long-\nterm sustainability of a critical training and deployment base by providing water security in a \ndrought-stricken region.  The military construction project satisfies a court order to find a \nphysical solution to an ongoing, more than 64-year dispute over water rights.  This project is \nDOD\u2019s contribution to the physical solution which, if not built in time, would allow the State to \ntake Camp Pendleton\u2019s water rights back and force the Department of the Navy and the \nFallbrook Public Utility District to reapply, thereby losing some of the most senior water rights \non the river.  Without this project, Camp Pendleton would not be able to ensure the future supply \nof potable water that is required to train and deploy Marines of the I Marine Expeditionary \nForce.  \n \nAvailability of Information - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP):  The \nAdministration has a number of concerns with section 607, which would require the Secretary of \nAgriculture, in administering the supplemental nutrition assistance program, to \u201censure that any \nsafeguards that prevent the use or disclosure of information obtained from applicant households \nshall not prevent the use of that information by, or the disclosure of that information to, the \nSecretary of Defense for purposes of determining the number of applicant households that \ncontain one or more members of a regular component or reserve component of the Armed \n9  Forces.\u201d  The Department of Agriculture would want to ensure that no provision compromises \naccess to SNAP and confidentiality for military members in need who seek assistance, and is \nunclear on the implications of the provision as drafted. \n \nHanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) Contract Oversight:  The \nAdministration objects to section 3115, to the extent that it would establish an owner's \nrepresentative to carry out certain inherently governmental activities, such as the direct oversight \nof another contractor and the resolution of nuclear safety issues.  While the Department of \nEnergy (DOE) supports utilizing an owner\u2019s representative to provide assistance to the Federal \nProject Director, section 3115 would interfere with the relationship between DOE and its \nrepresentative by prescribing the representative\u2019s duties.  Section 3115 also inappropriately \nmandates completion of updated preliminary documented safety analyses before technical issues \nassociated with the WTP are resolved and necessary design changes are identified.   \n \nLaboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD):  The Administration objects to \nSection 3117, which would increase the maximum amount that can be redirected from funded \nprojects to the National Nuclear Security Administration LDRD from six percent to eight \npercent.  Both the Commission to Review the Effectiveness of the National Energy Laboratories \nand Secretary of Energy\u2019s Advisory Board are currently looking at the overall issue of LDRD \nand are going to be making recommendations on LDRD rates in the future.  \nDefense Meteorological Satellite Program:  The Administration objects to section 1607, which \nwould limit the availability of all funding for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program \n(DMSP)-20 and its launch until several onerous prerequisites are met.  By 2017, only one DMSP \nsatellite will be within its design life.  Senior DOD officials have already certified that this fully-\nbuilt and recently-refurbished satellite is a cost-effective solution to the expected shortfall in \npolar-orbiting weather satellites, which GAO has chronicled in its High Risk List.  Because \nweather satellite data are shared among defense, intelligence, civil, and international users, \ndelays in launching this satellite would have broad implications, including reduced accuracy of \nweather prediction models and degraded efficiency of surveillance and reconnaissance platforms.  \nLaunching DMSP-20 as soon as possible also minimizes the hefty maintenance cost of $70 \nmillion per year.  Section 1607 would unnecessarily delay the launch of this satellite, elevating \nrisks to a variety of national missions and increasing costs to the taxpayer.  \n \nConstitutional Concerns:  A number of provisions raise additional constitutional \nconcerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these \nand other concerns. \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n10  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  January 11, 2016 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3662 \u2013 Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act \n  (Rep. Russell, R-OK, and 62 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, \nwhich would prevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction (JCPOA) by tying the Administration's ability to fulfill U.S. commitments under the deal \nto unrelated, non-nuclear issues. \n \nH.R. 3662 includes provisions that connect the United States' JCPOA commitment to provide \nsanctions relief by delisting certain Iran-related individuals and entities, including banks, to \nnon-nuclear issues outside of the scope of the JCPOA.  In addition, certain provisions would \neffectively preclude delisting of individuals or entities on Implementation Day of the JCPOA \u2013 \nthe day on which the International Atomic Energy Agency verifies that Iran has completed key \nnuclear-related steps that significantly dismantle and constrain its nuclear program \u2013 based on \nactivity that may have taken place and ended long before Implementation Day and involving \npersons or activity that will no longer be sanctioned post-Implementation Day.  By preventing \nthe United States from fulfilling its JCPOA commitments, H.R. 3662 could result in the collapse \nof a comprehensive diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon.  Such a collapse would remove the unprecedented constraints on \nIran's nuclear program that we achieved in the JCPOA, lead to the unraveling of the international \nsanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to America's credibility as a leader of \ninternational diplomacy.  This would have ripple effects, jeopardizing the hard work of \nsustaining a unified coalition to combat Iran's destabilizing activities in the region, calling into \nquestion the effectiveness of our sanctions regime and our ability to lead the world on nuclear \nnon-proliferation. \n \nThe Administration has consistently made clear that the purpose of the nuclear negotiations, and \nultimately the JCPOA, was to address one issue only \u2013 the international community's concerns \nover Iran's nuclear program and to verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  The \nJCPOA is the mechanism through which the United States was able to garner international \nsupport for our sanctions and achieve a diplomatic resolution.  \n \nAs we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, \nthe Administration remains clear-eyed and shares the deep concerns of the Congress and the \nAmerican people about Iran's support for terrorism.  Powerful sanctions targeting Iran's support \nfor terrorism, its ballistic missile activities, its human rights abuses, and its destabilizing \nactivities in the region remain in effect.  Anyone worldwide who transacts with or supports \nindividuals or entities sanctioned in connection with Iran's support for terrorism or development \nof WMD and their means of delivery, including missiles \u2013 or who does the same with any \nIranian individual or entity who remains on Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals and \nBlocked Persons List \u2013 puts themselves at risk of being sanctioned.  The President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful \nimplementation of the JCPOA.  If the President were presented with H.R. 3662, he would veto \nthe bill.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nApril 18, 2016 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1206 \u2013 No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act \n (Rep.

These bills would impose unnecessary constraints on the Internal \nRevenue Service's (IRS) operations without improving the agency's ability to administer the tax \ncode and serve taxpayers. \n \nH.R. 1206 would prohibit the IRS from hiring any new employees until the Secretary of the \nTreasury certifies that no IRS employee has a seriously delinquent debt, or provides a report to \nthe Congress that includes an explanation of why certification is not possible and what would be \nrequired to provide such a certification. The bill could result in the IRS being prohibited from \nhiring any new employees for any purpose \u2013 a drastic and counterproductive step that would \ncompromise tax administration and taxpayer services.  The bill is also unworkable in operation, \nas \"seriously delinquent\" debts could be as low as $1 and tax liens are recorded on a case-by-case \nbasis.  This legislation is unnecessary, as strong laws and procedures already exist to ensure that \nIRS employees comply with their tax obligations.  Publicly-available data show that IRS \nemployees are among the most tax compliant groups in the Nation with a delinquency rate of less \nthan 1 percent.   \n \nH.R. 4890 would ban performance awards to IRS employees until the Secretary of the Treasury \ndevelops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy.  This bill is unnecessary, \nas the IRS has already developed and has begun to execute a strategy to improve taxpayer \nservices.  The real constraint on the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers effectively is severe \nunderfunding, including for taxpayer services.  IRS funding is more than $900 million below its \n2010 level, before adjusting for inflation.  These budget cuts have impeded the IRS's ability to \nserve taxpayers, including inadequate responses to taxpayer calls and correspondence.  Filing \nseason statistics show that taxpayer service has improved this year as a result of a small funding \nincrease provided last year, but more resources are needed to serve all taxpayers effectively and \nefficiently.  Legislation constraining the IRS's ability to retain and recruit highly qualified \nemployees is not needed and could be counterproductive to the Service's mission. \n \nH.R. 3724 would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily separated \ndue to misconduct.  The bill as written could force the immediate termination of employees who \nhad been terminated and rehired many years ago, even if their performance since rehiring has \nbeen blemish-free.  The bill's prohibition is also unnecessary because current IRS processes  already ensure the agency does not rehire former employees who had significant conduct or \nperformance problems during prior employment with the agency.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nApril 26, 2016 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4498 \u2013 Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act \n(Rep. Chabot, R-OH, and 11 cosponsors)  \n   \nThe Administration is committed to helping entrepreneurs and small business owners access the \ncapital they need to innovate, grow their enterprises, and create jobs.  H.R. 4498, the Helping \nAngels Lead Our Startups (HALOS) Act, seeks to further these objectives by creating a new \nexemption to the prohibition of general solicitation for companies issuing private securities.  \nSpecifically, the bill would require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revise \nRegulation D so that the prohibition against general solicitation does not apply to presentations \nor communications made at an event sponsored by certain organizations.   \n \nAlthough H.R. 4498 seeks to increase opportunities for companies to access investment capital, \nthe Administration is concerned that the bill does not properly weigh the need for, and \nimportance of, appropriate investor protections.  Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups \n(JOBS) Act requires that issuers selling securities in private markets through general solicitation \ntake \"reasonable steps\" to verify that all purchasers are \"accredited investors.\"  This requirement \nhelps ensure that unsophisticated investors do not make investments when they may not \nunderstand the attendant risks.  Creating a new exemption to this requirement may make it easier \nfor companies to access necessary capital, but providing such an exemption comes at the cost of \npotentially increasing undue risk for certain investors.  \n \nAdditionally, the SEC already has sought to alleviate some of the burden on startups and other \nsmall companies by exempting them from the \"reasonable steps\" requirement when the \ncompanies have a pre-existing, substantive relationship with the potential investors or have \ncontacted the potential investors through a personal network before making a general \nsolicitation.  The SEC determined that these relationships or communications were a sensible \nsubstitute for the \"reasonable steps\" otherwise required to assure that all purchasers were \naccredited investors, and did not unreasonably undermine investor protection. \n \nThe JOBS Act charged the SEC with implementing its titles through a robust rulemaking \nprocess, and the agency has done so by taking into account both the importance of access to \ncapital for companies, as well as the importance of investor protection, both of which are \nessential for a well-functioning marketplace.  Any legislation that seeks to facilitate greater \ncapital formation by clarifying or amending Federal securities law should similarly take both of \nthese considerations into account.  We look forward to working with the Congress on this \nlegislation as it moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nFebruary 10, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH. R. 644 \u2013 Fighting Hunger Incentive Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Reed, R-New York, and seven cosponsors)  \nThe Administration supports measures that enhance non-profits, philanthropic organizations, \nand faith-based and other charitable organizations in their many roles, including providing a \nsafety net for those most in need, creating jobs that serve communities, encouraging \nenvironmental conservation and protection of land for current and future generations, and  \nincubating innovative solutions to some of the Nation's toughest challenges.  The President's \nBudget includes a number of proposals that would enhance and simplify charitable giving \nincentives for many individuals.  \nHowever, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 644, which would \npermanently extend three current provisions that offer enhanced tax breaks for certain \ndonations and add another similar provision without offsetting the cost.  House Republicans \nare making clear their priorities by rushing to make these tax cuts permanent without offsets \nwhen key tax credit improvements benefiting 16 million working families with children are \nscheduled to expire.  They are also seeking to impose a double standard by adding to the \ndeficit to continue and create tax breaks that primarily benefit higher-income individuals, after \ninsisting on offsetting the cost of measures that help middle-class and working Americans, \nsuch as the extension of emergency unemployment benefits.  If this same, unprecedented \napproach of making certain traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed \nfor the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits over the \nnext ten years, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 2013. \nThe Administration wants to work with the Congress to make progress on measures that \nstrengthen America's charitable sector.

Luetkemeyer, R-MO, and 30 cosponsors)  \n   \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 766.  This bill would constrain Federal banking \nregulators' ability to appropriately engage with the financial institutions they regulate for \ncompliance with and enforcement of U.S. legal and regulatory requirements that are designed to \nprotect the United States financial system from money laundering, terrorist financing, and other \nserious financial crimes.  Requiring Federal banking agencies to satisfy a written materiality \nrequirement is unnecessary, overly burdensome, and could impede the Federal banking agencies' \nability to ensure financial institutions comply with important regulatory obligations, including \nmaintaining effective risk management and controls.  Restricting the Federal banking agencies in \nthis way could unnecessarily and dangerously hinder or compromise important law enforcement \nand national security efforts.   \n \nA critical component of the Federal banking agencies' capacity to supervise banks for \ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations is their ability to ensure that financial institutions \nunderstand and appropriately account for their specific money laundering and terrorist financing \nrisks.  To help institutions understand such risks, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and \nFederal banking agencies periodically advise financial institutions of money laundering and \nterrorist financing threats and related vulnerabilities, risks, and suspicious activity.  Financial \ninstitutions may use this information to understand and manage their risks, including determining \nwhether to terminate certain customer accounts if the institution determines that it is unable to \nmanage such risks adequately after giving such risks due consideration.   \n \nH.R. 766 would add a series of impediments to financial fraud enforcement by limiting, in \nvarious ways, the Attorney General's authority to investigate and bring claims under the \nFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  The FIRREA statute \nserves as a powerful tool to address and deter frauds committed against American consumers and \nfinancial institutions.  The various hurdles imposed by H.R. 766 would only make such \nenforcement efforts more burdensome, time consuming, and rare \u2013 a series of effects that will \nallow fraud schemes to continue unaddressed for longer periods of time, to the detriment of the \nsafety of consumers and the American financial system. \n \nIn addition, requiring Federal banking agencies to provide financial institutions with written \njustification disclosing information related to terrorist or other criminal activity may disclose \nsensitive information that could compromise important criminal and national security \ninvestigations and interests.  Such disclosures could lead financial institutions to take actions that \nwill tip off suspects that they are under investigation, undermining national security.  \n \n  Imposing burdensome and arbitrary standards hinder the ability of Federal financial regulators to \nprotect the financial system and consumers from unnecessary risks.     \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 766, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  September 6, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5063 \u2013 Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2016 \n(Rep.

Marino, R-PA, and 32 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that the regulatory process remains efficient and \neffective, and is tailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective manner.  H.R. 3438 \nwould promote unwarranted litigation, introduce harmful delay, and, in many cases, thwart \nimplementation of statutory mandates and execution of duly enacted laws.  The legislation also \nwould increase business uncertainty and undermine much-needed protections for the American \npublic, including critical rules that provide financial reform and protect public health, food \nsafety, and the environment.  For these reasons, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3438. \n  \nThe Unnecessary Delay of Rules Act would delay the implementation of \"high-impact\" rules \nuntil all legal challenges are fully exhausted or, if there is no legal challenge, until the end of a \nstatutorily prescribed period.  H.R. 3438 would require this delay of all rules without \nconsideration of the merits of the challenge or the consequences of delay.  These \"high-impact\" \nrules already must adhere to the particular requirements of the statute that the agency is \nimplementing as well as the requirements of other Federal statutes and the Constitution.  Indeed, in \nmany cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the particular rule.  The agency also \nmust comply with the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et \nseq.).  When issuing a major rule, an agency also must perform analyses of benefits and costs that \ntypically are required by one or more statutes (such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act), as well as by Executive Order \n12866.  Furthermore, courts already have the discretion to delay rules on a case-by-case \nbasis.  Thus, the Unnecessary Delay of Rules Act is entirely unnecessary and would promote \nlitigation designed only to delay rule implementation. \n  \nGiven the extensive existing statutory framework already governing agency rules, the additional \ndelays created by H.R. 3438 would needlessly endanger the welfare of the American public, \nwhile providing no benefit and creating a powerful incentive for litigation with little to no merit.  \n  \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3438, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n       September 27, 2016 \n     (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 6094 \u2013 Regulatory Relief for Small Businesses, Schools, and Nonprofits Act  \n(Rep. Walberg, R-MI, and 69 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 6094, which would delay implementation of the \nDepartment of Labor's overtime rule until the middle of next year, endangering a critical step toward \npromoting higher pay and undermining efforts to allow workers to better balance their work and family \nobligations. \n \nSince its creation, the 40-hour workweek has served as a cornerstone of the middle class.  Yet over the \npast several decades, overtime protections have eroded as a result of inflation and lobbyists' efforts to \nweaken them.  Today, only seven percent of full-time salaried workers qualify for overtime based on \ntheir pay, down sharply from 62 percent in 1975.  This means that more and more low- and middle-\nincome workers are being forced to work extra hours without being paid for them.  Despite strong \nincome growth in the last year, most American families have been squeezed by stagnant earnings \nduring this period, and the lack of overtime protections only has put them at a further disadvantage. \n \nThe Department issued its new overtime regulation in May and the new rule is set to go into effect on \nDecember 1, 2016.  The final rule raises the salary threshold, from $23,660 to $47,476 a year, under \nwhich most salaried workers are guaranteed overtime.  In doing so, it will extend overtime protections \nto 4.2 million additional Americans who are not currently eligible for overtime under Federal law, \nboosting workers' wages by $12 billion over the next decade.  The rule also will automatically update \nthe salary threshold every three years, to ensure that it does not erode again and to make it harder for \nemployers to misclassify workers to avoid paying the overtime pay they have earned.   \n \nThe final rule reflects input from hundreds of thousands of public comments and extensive stakeholder \nmeetings with employers, business associations, small businesses, workers, advocates, nonprofit \norganizations, educational institutions, and state and local governments.  The rule provides more than \nsix months for employers to prepare for implementation, more time than was allowed when the rule \nwas last updated with a comparable increase in the salary threshold.  Additionally, many employers, \nincluding nonprofits, institutions of higher education, and small businesses, are already taking steps to \ncome into compliance.  This bill would be disruptive to their efforts and create new uncertainty for \nemployers. \n \nWhile this bill seeks to delay implementation, the real goal is clear\u2014delay and then deny overtime pay \nto workers.  With a strong economy and labor market, now is a good time for employers to provide \nthese essential protections for workers, who cannot afford to wait. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 6094, he would veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  April 4, 2016 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 1890 \u2013 Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 \n(Sen.

Effective \nprotection of trade secrets promotes innovation that is the engine of the Nation's economy and \nminimizes threats to American businesses, the U.S. economy, and national security interests.  \nS. 1890 would establish a Federal civil private cause of action for trade secret theft that would \nprovide businesses with a more uniform, reliable, and predictable way to protect their valuable \ntrade secrets anywhere in the country. \n \nThe Administration has placed high priority on mitigating and combating the theft of trade \nsecrets, as exemplified in the Administration's Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property \nEnforcement, the Administration's Strategy on Mitigating the Theft of U.S. Trade Secrets, and \nExecutive Order 13694 authorizing sanctions on those who perpetrate cyber-enabled trade secret \ntheft.  S. 1890 would provide important protection to the Nation's businesses and industries, \nincluding through the establishment of a Federal civil cause of action for trade secret \nmisappropriation which would effectively build upon current Federal law and various State laws \nthat have largely adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.

Fitzpatrick, R-Pennsylvania, and eight cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 37.  The President has been clear about his opposition \nto legislation that would weaken and undermine the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act.  To that end, the Administration has significant concerns with \nprovisions that would undermine the Volcker Rule by further delaying a part of its \nimplementation to 2019.  The Volcker Rule is a key component of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform Act that prevents institutions from taking excessive risks through proprietary trading and \nfund investing, and taxpayers should not have to wait that long to have limits in place that protect \nthem from risky practices.   \n \nThe Administration also has concerns with other provisions that would roll back important \nderivatives reforms, as well as measures in the bill that would diminish protections for investors \nin public companies, including through reducing related reporting and disclosure \nrequirements.  More generally, the Administration has strong concerns with any provision that \nwould weaken key consumer and investor protections and elements of financial oversight.   \n \nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is helping prevent the kinds \nof excessive financial risk taking that caused the worst recession in more than 70 years, left \nmillions of Americans unemployed, and resulted in trillions of dollars in lost wealth.  These \nreforms help protect hard working families in everything from saving for retirement to the ability \nof small businesses to access credit through a stable financial system.

Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2685, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other \npurposes.  The Administration supports investments essential to execute the President's national \nsecurity and defense strategies, and appreciates the Committee's recognition that the President's \nBudget level is needed for DOD, as well as its support of the Counterterrorism Partnerships \nFund, which is a vital partnership-focused approach to counterterrorism.  However, the bill \ndrastically underfunds critical investments in DOD's base budget and instead uses Overseas \nContingency Operations (OCO) funding in ways that leaders in both parties have made clear are \ninappropriate.  Base budget sequestration levels will damage our ability to restore readiness, \nadvance badly-needed technological modernization, and keep faith with our troops and their \nfamilies.  Meanwhile, shifting base budget resources into OCO risks undermining a mechanism \nmeant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts and fails to provide a stable, multi-year \nbudget on which defense planning and fiscal policy are based.  The use of OCO funding to \ncircumvent budget caps in defense spending also ignores the long-term connection between \nnational security and economic security and fails to account for vital national security functions \ncarried out at non-defense agencies.   \n \nIn addition, the bill fails to support many of the needed force structure and weapons system \nreforms included in the President's Budget, and undermines a new Base Realignment and \nClosure (BRAC) round that would allow DOD to properly align the military's infrastructure with \nthe needs of its evolving force.  The President's defense strategy depends on investing every \ndollar where it will have the greatest effect, which the Administration's FY 2016 proposals will \naccomplish through critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, slow growth in \ncompensation, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The Committee's changes would constrain the \nability of DOD to align military capability and force structure with the President's defense \nstrategy, and would require the Department to retain unnecessary force structure and weapons \nsystems that cannot be adequately resourced in today's fiscal environment, contributing to a \nmilitary that will be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.  The bill also \ncontinues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay.  If the President \nwere presented with H.R. 2685, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  \n \nEnacting H.R. 2685 and adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending \nlimits for FY 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-class \npriorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to threaten \nsuch drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be motivated \nto come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The Republican \nframework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense for  FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts \nwould result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head \nStart, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and \nthousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and grants, along with other impacts that \nwould hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle \nclass. \n \nSequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only \nthrough pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland \nSecurity, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of \nour economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear \nthat he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense \nwithout also fixing non-defense. \n \nThe President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2685 and any other \nlegislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the \ninvestments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense \npriorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members \nof Congress from both parties have urged.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Defense \n \nSequestration and Misuse of OCO Funds.  The Administration strongly objects to the \nsequestration level appropriations in the bill for items that were requested in and belong in the \nbase budget, as well as the use of OCO\u2014a funding mechanism intended to pay for wars and not \nsubject to the budget caps\u2014to pay for $37.5 billion in base requirements.  Sequestration adds \nrisk to our national security by threatening the size, readiness, presence, and capability of our \nmilitary, and threatens the economic security on which our national security depends.  The \nCommittee clearly recognizes that the President's Budget level for defense is needed, but \nproposes to fund it by circumventing instead of increasing the budget caps.  This approach fails \nto provide the stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning is based; undermines a \nmechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts; locks in unacceptable funding \ncuts for national security activities at non-defense agencies like the Departments of State, \nHomeland Security, and Veterans Affairs; and also undermines national security by undermining \nthe Nation's economic security.   \n \nGuantanamo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 8100, 8101, \nand 8102 of the bill, which would restrict the Executive Branch's ability to manage the detainee \npopulation at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility.  Sections 8100 and 8101 would \nprohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and for the \nconstruction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the \nUnited States.  Section 8102 would continue restrictions relating to transfers of detainees abroad.  \nThe President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior \nlegislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions.  Operating the detention \nfacility at Guantanamo weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our \n2  relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  These provisions \nare unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the \nappropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute \nGuantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national \nsecurity interests.  Sections 8100 and 8102 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-\npowers principles in certain circumstances. \n \nMilitary Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC).  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress and MCRMC to improve our \nmilitary compensation and retirement systems, and encourages the Congress to support the \nadditional recommendations for which the Administration has transmitted legislation.  The \nAdministration continues to evaluate how the more complex recommendations of a Blended \nRetirement System would affect the All-Volunteer Force, and expects to provide the Committee \nwith further views on this proposal in the near future.  The Administration looks forward to \ncontinuing to work with the Congress and MCRMC on other provisions, to meet our solemn \nresponsibility to ensure that any changes protect the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer \nForce, improve quality-of-life for service members and their families, and safeguard the fiscal \nsustainability of the military compensation and retirement systems. \n \nCompensation Reform.  The FY 2016 Budget request provides the funding and common-sense \nreforms that will ensure that service members receive competitive pay and benefits and critical \ntraining and equipment.  The Administration believes it is imperative to slow the growth of basic \npay and housing allowances, modernize military healthcare, and reform how commissaries \noperate, and strongly encourages members of the Congress to support these reforms, which \nwould save $1.7 billion in FY 2016 and $18 billion through FY 2020. \n \nProhibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Round.  The \nAdministration strongly objects to the proposed $10.5 million reduction to funds that would \nsupport a 2017 BRAC round.  This impairs the ability of the Executive Branch to plan for \ncontingencies or make other needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and \nefficiency.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the BRAC authorization \nas requested, which would allow DOD to right-size its infrastructure while providing important \nassistance to affected communities, freeing resources currently consumed by maintaining \nunneeded facilities.  In the absence of authorization of a new round of BRAC, the Administration \nwill pursue alternative options to reduce this wasteful spending and ensure that DOD's limited \nresources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security. \n \nA-10 Aircraft.  The Administration strongly objects to section 8120 of the bill, which is \ninconsistent with DOD's fiscal constraints and current priorities.  Section 8120 would restrict \nDOD from obligating or expending funds to retire A-10 aircraft.  This restriction would \neliminate about $350 million in savings for FY 2016 and $4.7 billion in savings through \nFY 2019.  Further, it puts at risk needed recapitalization efforts adversely impacting the \nacquisition and manning of the Air Force fighter enterprise.  DOD needs to focus its resources on \nthe Joint Strike Fighter and other multi-mission aircraft, which will replace the A-10's singular \nmission of close air support while also providing other critical capabilities. \n \nAviation Restructure Initiative (ARI).  The Administration strongly objects to section 8116 of the \nbill, which does not allow the transfer of any AH-64 Apache helicopters in FY 2016 and will \nnegatively affect the Army's readiness and ability to prepare and deploy forces to meet ongoing \n3  operations.  The FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) established limitations \non the ARI, but provided for the transfer of certain numbers of aircraft in time for congressional \nreview of the report of the Commission on the Future of the Army before transfer of additional \naircraft.  Delaying the transfer until the passage of the FY 2016 NDAA will damage the \nreadiness of Army units in the 1st Infantry Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in October \n2015, the 25th Infantry Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in February 2016, and the 10th \nMountain Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in June 2016.  The National Guard Bureau \nhas concurred with the transfers and has plans in place with the States involved for the first 48 \nApache aircraft.  DOD's plan for the transfer of select numbers of aircraft between the \ncomponents in FY 2016 is in compliance with the FY 2015 NDAA and is the same as the \nnumber of Apache aircraft (72) that the National Guard Bureau agreed to transfer in its aviation \nproposal.  The Administration urges the Congress to remain consistent with the FY 2015 NDAA \nand permit the transfer of 72 Apache aircraft in FY 2016. \n \nMissile Defense Programs.  The Administration strongly objects to funding reductions to several \nballistic missile defense programs, specifically, the proposed reduction of $61.4 million to \nImproved Homeland Defense Interceptors (also known as the Redesigned Kill Vehicle program), \nwhich is needed to improve the reliability, producibility, and sustainability of the Ground-Based \nInterceptor.  This reduction will delay the program beyond the required 2020 timeline to protect \nthe United States.  In addition, the Administration opposes the $25 million reduction to the \nCommand, Control, Battle Management and Communications program and the $13 million \nreduction to the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor program.  Funding for both efforts is critical to meet \nthe President's European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase III.  Finally, the Administration \nobjects to the Committee-proposed reductions of $38.2 million to Technology Maturation \nInitiatives and $26.2 million to Special Programs.  These efforts are critical to ensuring the \nUnited States stays ahead of future ballistic missile threats. \n \nDefense Meteorological Satellite Program.  The Administration strongly objects to the \nelimination of all funding for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-20 and its \nlaunch.  By 2017, only one DMSP satellite will be within its design life.  DOD has certified that \nthis fully-built and recently-refurbished satellite is a cost-effective solution to the expected \nshortfall in polar-orbiting weather satellites, which the Government Accountability Office has \nchronicled in its High Risk List.  Because weather satellite data are shared among defense, \nintelligence, civil, and international users, eliminating this satellite would have broad \nimplications, including reduced accuracy of weather prediction models and degraded efficiency \nof surveillance and reconnaissance platforms.  Launching DMSP-20 also provides a competitive \nlaunch opportunity, which is a cornerstone of the Department's strategy to maintain assured \naccess to space. \n \nFunding Restriction on the Enforcement of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  \nThe Administration strongly objects to the prohibition of funding for the enforcement of section \n526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  This provision undercuts a law that \nprovides an environmentally sound framework for the development of future alternative fuels, \nwhich contribute to a diverse, cost-competitive energy supply that enhances American energy \nsecurity. \n \nUnrequested Funding.  In this fiscally constrained environment, the Administration strongly \nobjects to the billions of dollars provided for items that were not in the FY 2016 Budget request, \noffset by equal reductions to higher priority items that the military needs.  Unrequested items \n4  include $1 billion for extra Joint Strike Fighters, $1 billion for additional F-18 aircraft, $1.1 \nbillion to reverse planned savings associated with compensation reform proposals, $1.5 billion \nfor National Guard and Reserve Equipment, $1 billion for additional Army vehicles and weapons \nsystems, $635 million to fund an Afloat Forward Staging Base, and $65 million for an additional \nCV-22 Osprey aircraft.  The Administration has made extensive efforts to assess, prioritize, and \nbalance force capacity, capability, and readiness in developing the FY 2016 Budget.  The \nAdministration also objects to section 8006 of the bill, which places spending on unrequested \nitems into statute. \n \nDDG-51 Destroyers.  The Administration strongly objects to the reduction of $136.8 million in \nDDG-51 shipbuilding funds.  This reduction would make the DDG-51 program unexecutable, \nand preclude award of the second FY 2016 DDG as the initial Flight III ship.  This reduction \nwould prevent the Navy from fielding the Flight III variant as planned, resulting in a delay of \ncritically needed Integrated Air and Missile Defense capability to the Fleet. \n \nDefense Health Program.  The Administration strongly objects to the bill's $1.4 billion reduction \nto the Defense Health Program within Operation and Maintenance.  Military medicine has had \ndramatic cost increases in FY 2015, and these costs are projected to continue to rise.  DOD has \ntaken aggressive action to address increases in costs where possible and has strategies in place to \ncontinue these efforts.  However, we must ensure the health of the force and their families, along \nwith upholding the promise to our retirees.  This will be increasingly difficult to achieve absent \nsufficient funding at the level established in the President's Budget request.  Without funding at \nthe level requested, the Department will be forced to eliminate needed medical support programs \nand initiatives. \n \nAircraft Carrier Replacement Program.  The Administration objects to the bill's $74.7 million \nreduction to the Department of the Navy's Aircraft Carrier Replacement Program, ship \nconstruction account.  This funding reduction impacts five systems critical to the ship's required \ncapability, presenting unacceptable risk to CVN 79 being delivered as a fully usable military \nwarfighting asset.  The Department of the Navy, in conjunction with industry, has implemented \noversight and funding proposals that will yield cost reductions in CVN 79 as compared to CVN \n78.  Any further reduction would place additional risk to delivering integral warfighting systems \nand would likely inhibit the Aircraft Carrier Replacement Program's ability to meet the FY 2014 \nNDAA cost limitations for CVN 79 procurement. \n \nSpace Modernization Initiative (SMI).  The Administration objects to the $191 million reduction \nin SMI funding for the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Advanced Extremely High \nFrequency (AEHF) System.  The Department's 2014 Space Strategic Portfolio review \nrecommended significant changes to our space-based capabilities in the face of dramatically \nincreasing threats.  The SMI is the critical resource to enable the evolution of the current SBIRS \nand AEHF systems to assured architectures, consistent with the DOD analyses.  Full funding of \nSMI allows the Department to dramatically reduce the technical, programmatic, and operational \nrisks of these required architecture changes in advance of the major acquisition contract award, \nand assure that we will not suffer a capability gap in our most important mission areas.  Failing \nto invest in SMI technology maturation now will limit these systems to 1995 sensor technology \nand the associated obsolescence in our next satellite acquisition. \n \nLimitation on Authorization for Certain FY 2016 Projects.  The Administration objects to section \n8111 of the bill, which would limit expending funds associated with the construction of the Joint \n5  Intelligence Analysis Complex Consolidation (JIAC), Phase 2, at Royal Air Force Croughton, \nUnited Kingdom, and would limit action to realign forces at Lajes Field, Azores, until the \nDepartment conveys specific information to the Committee.  The Administration looks forward \nto working with the Congress on this issue in order to avoid the potential for significant financial \ncosts during a period of constrained resources, uncertainty among our allies that share equities in \nthe JIAC, and disruption in intelligence support to the warfighter. \n \nOperation and Maintenance, Procurement, and Military Personnel Reductions.  The \nAdministration objects to the billions of dollars of undistributed reductions in the bill across the \nOperation and Maintenance, Procurement, and Military Personnel accounts.  The Operation and \nMaintenance reductions would be applied to specific programs, which include facilities \nsustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions will delay the \nDepartment's full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts. \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration \nappreciates the support the Committee provided for the DATA Act by fully funding the FY 2016 \nBudget request for the Department of Defense to implement the Act.  \n \nClassified Programs.  The Administration looks forward to providing its views on the \nadjustments contained in the Classified Annex to the bill once it becomes available.  \n \nAdditional Constitutional Concerns.  Several other provisions in the bill raise constitutional \nconcerns.  For instance, section 8117 may interfere with the President's authority as Commander \nin Chief and section 8009 could interfere with the President's authority with regard to sensitive \nnational security information.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n6  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  October 7, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 538 \u2013 Native American Energy Act \n(Rep.

In addition, the bill\u2019s changes to mineral leasing laws applicable to \nNavajo Nation lands may adversely affect energy development on those lands. \n \nThe bill also stipulates that Indian lands are exempt from the Department of the Interior\u2019s \nhydraulic fracturing rule.

Income from energy development is one of the larger sources of revenue generated \nfrom trust lands, and delays in development translate to delays in profits to Indian mineral rights \nowners.  The Administration has been taking meaningful action to update the leasing process for \nlands held in trust for Indian tribes, and is actively working to expedite appraisals, leasing, and \npermitting on Indian lands, and to provide resources to ensure safe and responsible development.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to develop the reforms \nnecessary to support such development. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  November 29, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 6392 - Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2016  \n(Rep. Luetkemeyer, R-MO) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 6392, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement \nAct of 2016.  Actions taken in the years since enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nand Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) are curbing excessive risk-taking, closing \nregulatory gaps, and making our financial system safer and more resilient, for both markets and \nconsumers.  H.R. 6392 would severely weaken these reforms, put in place to discourage dozens \nof the Nation's largest banks from engaging in the risky behavior that precipitated the 2008 \nfinancial crisis.  We have made great progress as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, and we cannot \nafford to return to the days of deregulation and lax oversight.   \n \nThe financial crisis revealed grave weaknesses in the Nation's financial regulatory framework.   \nBy passing and signing the landmark reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Congress and the \nPresident, respectively, took significant steps to limit risks to financial stability and protect \ntaxpayers from the consequences of such risks.  Because of the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial \nregulators have better tools to deal with financial shocks when they occur, and are able to protect \nMain Street and taxpayers from Wall Street's recklessness.  The law, among many other risk \ncontrols, provides the prudential regulators, and in particular the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors, the ability to apply enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies with \nmore than $50 billion in total consolidated assets.  In conjunction, the law provides for a rigorous \nstress-testing regime, along with capital, liquidity and living will requirements, to better ensure \nthat financial institutions are prepared for severe economic circumstances.  Only a financial \nsystem strong enough to withstand a major financial shock is capable of promoting sustainable \neconomic growth. \n \nBank holding companies of all sizes were already subject to the Federal Reserve's supervision \nprior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.  In light of the greater risks posed by the Nation's \nlargest banks as exhibited in the financial crisis, the Congress directed the Federal Reserve to \nsimply apply stricter and escalating prudential standards to these few institutions with more than \n$50 billion in total consolidated assets.  This crucial underpinning of Wall Street reform better \npositions our regulators to shed light on emerging threats and reduce the likelihood of another \nfinancial crisis.  \n \nH.R. 6392 would eliminate the $50 billion threshold, impairing the application of enhanced \nprudential standards to trillions of dollars of assets managed by dozens of the Nation's largest \nbanks.  Under H.R. 6392, only eight U.S. global systemically important banks would be subject \nto enhanced prudential standards without further action by the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil (FSOC).  All other bank holding companies \u2013 including more than 20 large regional \nbanks, each with more than $50 billion in assets and some that played a significant role in the \nfinancial crisis and received taxpayer support \u2013 would have to go through an extensive process  and be individually designated by the FSOC as a precondition for increased oversight.  While an \nextensive designation process is appropriate for nonbank financial companies that would be \nnewly regulated by the Federal Reserve, such a process is inappropriate for bank holding \ncompanies already supervised by the Federal Reserve.  The new administrative burden imposed \nby H.R. 6392 would only distract the FSOC from focusing on its mission to proactively identify \nand protect against risks in the financial system before they wreak havoc on the Nation's \neconomy.  Requirements that impede the ability of regulators to apply common-sense safeguards \nin a tiered and tailored manner to large financial institutions only expose taxpayers to the very \nrisks that led to the financial crisis.    \n \nThe President has been clear about his opposition to any legislation that would weaken or reduce \noversight of the financial system.  H.R. 6392 would hamper oversight of dozens of the largest \nbanks in the country and drastically roll back necessary provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, \nhamstringing regulators charged with monitoring and regulating the largest financial institutions \nand reverting to deficient, pre-crisis standards. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 6392, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n) \nJune 2, 2015 \n                                                                                                                        (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH. R. 2289 \u2013 Commodity End-User Relief Act \n(Rep. Conaway, R-TX, and three cosponsors)  \n \nThe Administration is firmly committed to strengthening the Nation's financial system through \nthe implementation of key reforms to safeguard derivatives markets and ensure a stronger and \nfairer financial system for investors and consumers.  The full benefit to the Nation's citizens and \nthe economy cannot be realized unless the entities charged with establishing and enforcing the \nrules of the road have the resources to do so.  \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes the passage of H.R. 2289 because it undermines the \nefficient functioning of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by imposing a \nnumber of organizational and procedural changes and would undercut efforts taken by the CFTC \nover the last year to address end-user concerns.  H.R. 2289 also offers no solution to address the \npersistent inadequacy of the agency's funding.  The CFTC is one of only two Federal financial \nregulators funded through annual discretionary appropriations, and the funding the Congress has \nprovided for it over the past five years has failed to keep pace with the increasing complexity of \nthe Nation's financial markets.  The changes proposed in H.R. 2289 would hinder the ability of \nthe CFTC to operate effectively, thereby threatening the financial security of the middle class by \nencouraging the same kind of risky, irresponsible behavior that led to the great recession.  \n \nPrior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the \nderivatives markets were largely unregulated. Losses connected to derivatives rippled through \nthat hidden network, playing a central role in the financial crisis.  Wall Street Reform resulted in \nsignificant expansion of the CFTC's responsibilities, establishing a framework for standardized \nover-the-counter derivatives to be traded on regulated platforms and centrally cleared, and for \ndata to be reported to repositories to increase transparency and price discovery.  The changes \nproposed in H.R. 2289 would hinder the CFTC's progress in successfully implementing these \ncritical responsibilities and would unnecessarily disrupt the effective management and operation \nof the agency without providing the more robust and reliable funding that the agency needs.  \n \nIn order to respond quickly to market events and market participants, the CFTC needs funding \ncommensurate with its evolving oversight framework.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress to authorize fee funding for the CFTC as proposed in the FY 2016 \nBudget request, a shift that would directly reduce the deficit.  User fees were first proposed in the \nPresident\u2019s Budget by the Reagan Administration more than 30 years ago and have been \nsupported by every Democratic and Republican Administration since that time.  Fee funding \nwould shift CFTC costs from the general taxpayer to the primary beneficiaries of the CFTC\u2019s \noversight in a manner that maintains the efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity of \nthe Nation\u2019s futures, options, and swaps markets, and supports market access for smaller market \nparticipants hedging or mitigating commercial or agricultural risk.   \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2289, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nMarch 1, 2016 \n                              (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3716 \u2013 Ensuring Removal of Terminated Providers from Medicaid and CHIP Act \n(Rep.

The \nAffordable Care Act requires that State Medicaid programs terminate participation of health care \nproviders that have been terminated by Medicare or another State Medicaid program.

Barrasso, R-WY, and 46 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes S. 1140, which would require the Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) and the Department of the Army (Army) to withdraw and re-propose specified \nregulations needed to clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The \nagencies' rulemaking, grounded in science and the law, is essential to ensure clean water for \nfuture generations, and is responsive to calls for rulemaking from the Congress, industry, and \ncommunity stakeholders as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The final rule has been \nthrough an extensive public engagement process.  \n  \nClean water is vital for the success of the Nation's businesses, agriculture, energy development, \nand the health of our communities.  More than one in three Americans get their drinking water \nfrom rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that are at risk of pollution from upstream sources.  The \nprotection of wetlands is also vital for hunting and fishing.  When Congress passed the CWA in \n1972 to restore the Nation's waters, it recognized that to have healthy communities downstream, \nwe need to protect the smaller streams and wetlands upstream.   \n  \nClarifying the scope of the CWA helps to protect clean water, safeguard public health, and \nstrengthen the economy.  Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 focused on specific \njurisdictional determinations and rejected the analytical approach that the Army Corps of \nEngineers used for those determinations, but did not invalidate the underlying regulation.  This \nhas created ongoing questions and uncertainty about how the regulation is applied consistent \nwith the Court's decisions.  The final rule was developed to address this uncertainty. \n  \nIf S. 1140 were enacted, any revisions to the CWA regulations would require the agencies to \ndefine waters of the United States in a manner inconsistent with the CWA as interpreted by the \nU.S. Supreme Court, resulting in more confusion, uncertainty, and inconsistency. \n   \nS. 1140 would require the agencies to expend scarce resources to duplicate the transparent \nrulemaking process just completed, which involved extensive public outreach and participation, \nincluding over 400 public meetings, and 1 million public comments.  The agencies met with \nStates, municipalities, small businesses, farmers, ranchers, miners, foresters, conservation \ngroups, and many others to solicit input and reflect that input in a final rule.  A regulation as \nprescribed in S. 1140 would raise costs for landowners and businesses seeking a CWA permit \nand increase delays in the permit process.  S. 1140 also would reduce protection of the Nation's \nwater quality and result in higher drinking water treatment costs, increased contamination of fish \nand shellfish, loss of recreational opportunities including hunting and fishing, and more frequent \nalgal blooms that choke rivers and lakes and make waters unhealthy as a drinking water source \nor to swim and fish in.  Wetlands serve as a natural buffer to reduce flooding, and by ignoring \nthis important role, S.1140 also would lead to more frequent and more damaging losses from  floods.  Families, communities, and businesses will have no choice but to pay for increased flood \nprotection that natural wetlands currently provide for free. \n  \nIf the President were presented with S. 1140, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n                    November 16, 2015 \n                    (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1737 \u2014 Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act \n(Rep.

Chabot, R-Ohio, and 21 cosponsors)\nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they \nare tailored to advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that \nthey minimize uncertainty.  H.R. 527, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements \nAct, would impose unneeded and costly analytical and procedural requirements on agencies that \nwould prevent them from performing their statutory responsibilities.  It would also create \nneedless regulatory and legal uncertainty and costs for businesses and the American public.  \nAccordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 527.  \nThe bill would impose unnecessary new procedures on agencies and invite frivolous \nlitigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the \nrobust and well understood procedural requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as \namended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, as well as the \nAdministrative Procedure Act and other Federal statutes such as the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct and the Paperwork Reduction Act.   \nThe Administration agrees that the Regulatory Flexibility Act establishes a national commitment \nto achieving statutory goals without imposing unnecessary burdens on the public, especially \nsmall business.  The Administration also recognizes the importance of considering alternate \nregulatory approaches that could minimize the significant economic impact of rules on small \nbusinesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.  In addition, for decades \nagency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by \nadministrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate \nregulations only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider \nregulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  With respect to the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act in particular, agencies already have in place procedures and policies, as required \nby Executive Orders 12866, 13272, 13563, and 13610 to ensure that agencies take into account \nthe consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.   \nFurthermore, this Administration's deep commitment to promoting small business and ensuring \nthat regulations do not unduly burden the Nation's small businesses is reflected in Executive \nOrders 13563 and 13610.  These Executive Orders require agencies to examine existing \nregulations and to eliminate, streamline, or alter them where they are excessively burdensome. In \nparticular, Executive Order 13610 directs agencies to give special consideration to initiatives that \nwould reduce unjustified regulatory burdens or simplify or harmonize regulatory requirements \nimposed on small businesses.  In response to these Executive Orders, twice a year agencies \ndevelop and publish their retrospective review plans for public comment.   \nPassage of H.R. 527 would burden the existing framework with layers of new procedural \nrequirements that would seriously undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory  mandates.  It would expand the use of advocacy review panels, create needless grounds for \njudicial review and judicial remedies, and impose unrealistic analytic requirements on \nagencies.  In these ways and others, H.R. 527 would impede the ability of agencies to provide the \npublic with basic protections, and create needless confusion and delay that would prove \ndisruptive for businesses as well as for State, Tribal and local governments.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 527, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n* * * * * * *\n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nJune 21, 2016 \n                                                                                                                       (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n  \nH.R. 1270 \u2013 The Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2015 \n(Rep.

Most of \nthe provisions included in this bill will strengthen the Administration\u2019s ability to both facilitate \ntrade and improve enforcement of the rules. These new tools will strengthen the Administration\u2019s \nability to level the playing field for U.S. workers, businesses and farmers.

But we have concerns with a specific provision that would grant the \nviolator or alleger the ability to file a complaint in the Court of International Trade.  This would \nundermine enforcement of antidumping/countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws, going against a \ncore objective of the bill.

We support \nsections 711 and 712 of the bill, which target unfair currency practices and would establish \nobjective standards and strong potential remedies that can further our goal of leveling the playing \nfield for American workers and firms.  These provisions targeting currency practices in this \nmanner would be the strongest in history if enacted.  But the Administration opposes the way the \nbill uses the countervailing duty process to address currency undervaluation.  Those provisions \nwould undermine our international efforts to address this issue, raise highly problematic \nquestions about consistency with our international obligations, lead to other countries pursuing \nretaliatory measures that could hurt our exporters, and be difficult to administer.  \n \nThe Administration supports a more transparent process for considering duty suspensions, but  has concerns that trade policy considerations, such as the effect of duty suspensions on U.S. \npreference programs and current and future free trade agreement partners, have not been \nincluded in the bill. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these concerns and \nadvancing the policies set forth in this bill. \n  \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nMarch 14, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3797 \u2013 Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment (SENSE) Act  \n(Rep. Rothfus, R-PA, and six cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3797, which would threaten the health of Americans \nby requiring changes to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Cross-State Air Pollution \nRule (CSAPR) and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for electric generating units \n(EGUs) that use coal refuse as their main fuel source.  Specifically, H.R. 3797 would restrict the \nmarket-based approach currently used to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances issued \nunder the CSAPR, thereby raising the costs of achieving the pollution reduction required by the \nrule.  The bill also would undermine the emissions limits for hazardous acid gases from those \nestablished under the MATS, leading to increased health and environmental impacts from \nincreased emissions of hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, other harmful acid gases, and \nsulfur dioxide.  \n \nCSAPR and MATS protect the health of millions of Americans by requiring the reduction of \nharmful power plant emissions, including air toxics and emissions that contribute to smog and \nfine particle pollution.  The pollution reductions from CSAPR and MATS will prevent thousands \nof premature deaths, asthma attacks, and heart attacks. An important feature of the CSAPR is its \ntrading program which allows power plants to meet emission budgets in different ways, \nincluding by trading emissions allowances between emission sources within a State and some \ntrading across States.  This market-based approach reduces the cost of compliance while \nensuring reductions in air pollution for citizens across the CSAPR region.   \n \nH.R. 3797 would create an uneven playing field by picking winners and losers in CSAPR \ncompliance.  The bill establishes a special market of CSAPR allowances for EGUs that burn coal \nrefuse and prohibits the trading of allowances allocated to coal refuse EGUs, which would \ninterfere with and manipulate market conditions.  By doing so, H.R. 3797 would:  (1) \neconomically advantage coal refuse EGUs over other EGUs by giving them allowances that \nwould otherwise have been allocated to others; (2) reduce compliance choices for other State \nunits; and (3) distort the economic incentives of coal refuse EGUs to reduce emissions.  Further, \nthe allowances allocated to coal refuse EGUs would be unavailable for use by any other sources, \nresulting, in the aggregate, in less efficient and more costly CSAPR compliance.  Additionally, \nH.R. 3797 would interfere with existing opportunities under the CSAPR for each State to control \nthe allocation of allowances among its EGUs.  \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3797, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nJune 1, 2015 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2578 \u2014 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2016 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2578, making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The bill drastically underfunds critical investments \nin research and development that are key to advancing U.S. economic competitiveness and \nreducing taxpayer costs for securing essential weather satellite data and conducting an effective \n2020 census.  It also severely underfunds State and local criminal justice assistance that helps \nensure the safety and well-being of individuals and communities, and underfunds programs that \nwould increase the use of body-worn cameras by law enforcement, expand training, provide \nmuch-needed police department reform, and multiply the number of cities where the Department \nof Justice facilitates community and local law enforcement engagement.  It also cuts support for \nNASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program that will help end our reliance on Russia for transporting \nastronauts, critical space technology investments that will help pave the path to reaching Mars, \nand earth science research that is helping us understand how our climate is changing and how to \nrespond to earthquakes, droughts, and severe weather events.  Furthermore, the legislation \nincludes highly objectionable provisions, including provisions that continue unwarranted \nrestrictions regarding detainees held at Guantanamo Bay that will undermine our national \nsecurity, severely inhibit efforts to combat illegal gun trafficking, and put in place non-germane \nforeign policy restrictions related to Cuba.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2578, his \nsenior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \nEnacting H.R. 2578 and adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending \nlimits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-\nclass priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to \nthreaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be \nmotivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The \nRepublican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense \nfor FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts \nwould result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head \nStart, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and \nthousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and grants, along with other impacts that \nwould hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle \nclass.   \n \nSequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only \nthrough pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland \nSecurity, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of  our economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear \nthat he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense \nwithout also fixing non-defense.   \n \nThe President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2578 and any other \nlegislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the \ninvestments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense \npriorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members \nof Congress from both parties have urged.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nDepartment of Commerce \n \nCensus Bureau Periodic Censuses and Programs (including 2020 Decennial Census).  The \nAdministration strongly objects to the inadequate funding provided to the Census Bureau to \nproduce robust economic and demographic data and prepare for the 2020 Decennial Census.  \nThe Committee's proposed funding level would increase taxpayers' cost of conducting the 2020 \nDecennial Census by billions of dollars by preventing the Census Bureau from developing, \ntesting, and implementing critical cost saving innovations.  In addition, the reductions in funding \nfor the American Community Survey threaten the data availability and coverage for rural \ncommunities and communities with small populations, depriving businesses and policy makers \nof the data necessary to make informed decisions. \n \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Labs.  The Administration urges the \nCongress to fund NIST research at the requested level given the important contributions that \nNIST makes to the U.S. economy.  Instead, the bill would eliminate funding for the lab-to-\nmarket initiative, constraining benefits to commercial entities and taxpayers from moving \ncutting-edge technologies out of Federal labs into the market.  It would also reduce NIST \nfunding for research that can strengthen U.S. leadership in the industries of the future, such as \ncyber-physical systems and biomanufacturing. \n \nManufacturing Programs.  The Administration strongly objects to the lack of funding provided \nfor manufacturing programs at NIST that would strengthen U.S. manufacturing at a time when \nan historic resurgence in U.S. manufacturing is taking hold.  In particular, the Committee \nprovides none of the requested funds for the Department of Commerce to establish two \nmanufacturing institutes as part of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation that are \ndesigned to bridge the gap between basic research and product development for technology \nareas.  These institutes encourage investment and production in the U.S. creating good jobs now \nand preparing American workers for future opportunities in the advanced manufacturing sector.  \nIn addition, the funding level in the bill would not allow the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership to provide its services to additional small and medium-sized manufacturers. \n \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Infrastructure.  The Administration \nobjects to the bill's funding level for NOAA's Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction \nprogram, which precludes needed long-term infrastructure investments to collect critical \nenvironmental data.  While the bill includes the requested funding for the current generation of \n2  critical weather satellites, it fails to provide the necessary resources to initiate the development of \nthe next generation of polar-orbiting weather satellites.  The continuity of these satellites has \nbeen highlighted as a high risk by independent groups and the Government Accountability \nOffice.  In addition to informing the day-to-day operations of businesses and individuals, \nweather data from NOAA satellites help predict the potential impact of extreme weather events, \nwhich lets communities and emergency responders prepare.  Not only would the bill heighten the \nrisk of a gap in satellite coverage, but its shortsighted reductions mean that the next generation of \npolar-orbiting weather satellites would cost taxpayers more.  In addition, the Administration \nurges the Congress to provide the funding necessary to acquire a NOAA research vessel.  \nNOAA's aging research fleet plays a critical role in the research and management of marine \nresources, directly supporting coastal economies and environmental stewardship. \n \nNOAA Operations.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the National \nWeather Service; however, the Administration opposes the funding levels provided for the \nNational Ocean Service and climate research programs, which are 15 percent and 32 percent \nbelow the FY 2016 Budget request, respectively.  The reductions impact two high priority \nprograms that help communities prepare for the effects of natural disasters and other \nramifications of climate change and provide the science necessary to inform their preparations.  \nThe Administration also urges the Congress to provide the requested funding to support \ninfrastructure permitting consultations, which would reduce project timeframes and support \neconomic development. \n \nInternational Trade Administration.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the \nrequested funding level of $497 million, which would allow for the expansion of the Interagency \nTrade Enforcement Center and SelectUSA.  These investments directly support businesses trying \nto compete in a global economy by ensuring a level playing field and helping secure new \ninvestments in local communities. \n \nEconomic Development Administration (EDA).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \nsupport for EDA's Economic Development Assistance Programs.  However, the Administration \nurges the Congress to provide the resources necessary for EDA to provide greater technical \nassistance to local communities and to make more effective use of a range of Federal economic \ndevelopment programs.  The FY 2016 Budget request for EDA furthers the agency's goal of \ncreating new jobs by expanding EDA's capacity to help communities develop and implement \ncomprehensive strategies for regional economic growth, work across silos of Federal, State, and \nother sources of assistance, and leverage scarce resources to maximize economic and community \ndevelopment opportunities. \n \nU.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 \nBudget request of $6.4 million for the Department of Commerce to develop a U.S. Digital \nService team.  This funding would support the Department's efforts to manage the agency's \ndigital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses, including increasing the \navailability of key data sets and improving the Department's interactions with the public. \n \nInternet Governance Transition.  The Administration strongly objects to the provision that \nprevents the National Telecommunications and Information Administration from using funds to \nrelinquish its responsibility with respect to internet domain name system functions, a \ncommitment the U.S. Government made more than a decade ago.  The successful transition of \nthese functions would facilitate a free and open internet managed through a multi-stakeholder \n3  governance structure. \n \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) \n \nFederal Law Enforcement.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for Federal \nlaw enforcement.  The bill provides $13.6 billion for the Department's law enforcement \ncomponents and adequately funds key priorities including counterterrorism, counterintelligence, \ncybersecurity, and combatting illegal drugs and the trafficking of firearms.  The Administration \nalso appreciates the investments in gun safety, including Now is the Time Comprehensive \nSchool Safety. \n \nCommunity Policing Initiative.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \nelements of the President's Community Policing Initiative, but strongly urges the Congress to \nfully fund the request.  As the Nation has observed in Baltimore and other communities, trust \nbetween law enforcement agencies and the people they protect and serve is essential.  However, \ncompared to the FY 2016 Budget request, the bill substantially underfunds the body-worn \ncamera program and related research, providing just $15 million of the requested $50 million for \nthese purposes.  Without these critical investments, the bill fails to fully support law enforcement \nand improve relations between communities and police.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress to fully fund this important initiative. \n \nState and Local Grants.  The Administration strongly objects to the inadequate funding level \nprovided for criminal justice assistance.  The bill provides $1.9 billion for State and local grants, \nwhich is approximately $500 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  The Administration \nstrongly objects to the lack of funding for traditional COPS programs, including the COPS hiring \nprogram, which could result in an estimated 1,300 fewer officers and diminish the capacity of the \nNation's first responders.  While the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program \nis formula-based, the COPS Hiring Program provides hiring and retention assistance directly to \ncommunities most in need.  In addition, the bill provides no specific funding for the National \nInstitute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice Statistics; allocating funding out of the grant \nappropriations for these research and statistical programs would reduce grant programs by an \nadditional $114 million from the FY 2016 Budget request.  The Administration is also concerned \nwith the significant reduction to juvenile justice programs.  These programs help reduce juvenile \ndelinquency and crime, protect public safety, hold offenders accountable, assist missing and \nexploited children and their families, and provide treatment and rehabilitative services tailored to \nthe needs of juveniles and their families. \n \nLegal Representation for Unaccompanied Children.  The Administration opposes the \nCommittee's failure to provide for greater access to legal representation and services for \nunaccompanied children in our immigration court system.  We need every element of the court \nprocess to work effectively to accomplish the goal of both honoring humanitarian claims and \nprocessing those individuals who do not qualify for relief.  Although this bill supports some \nAdministration immigration priorities, including the hiring of 55 additional Immigration Judge \nTeams, it fails to provide $50 million requested for legal representation for unaccompanied \nchildren in removal proceedings.  Without this funding, our efforts to process cases involving \nthis vulnerable population will be less efficient and effective. \n \nViolence Against Women.  The Administration appreciates the support for the Community Teams \nto Reduce the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Backlog and Improve Sexual Assault Investigations \n4  Program.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to provide adequate funding for the \nVAWA 20/20 Initiative and the Campus Program in order to address critical needs in the fight to \nstop violence against women, for the Tribal Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction \nProgram to support grants to assist tribal governments in exercising special domestic violence \ncriminal jurisdiction, and for research into reducing the backlog of sexual assault kits.  \nInvestments in these programs would help to improve victim safety, save lives, and establish \npractices that can be sustained in the coming years. \n \nGeneral Legal Activities.  The Administration is concerned that the bill neglects to provide the \nrequested increases for civil rights, environmental protection, healthcare fraud enforcement, \nhuman trafficking disruption, cybercrime prosecution, or international law enforcement training \nand justice development.  Given the recent events involving the mounting distrust between \ncommunities and law enforcement, the work of the Civil Rights Division in police reform is \nmore important than ever.  The bill provides $885 million for General Legal Activities,  \n$152 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  This funding is insufficient to support the \nAdministration priority to improve the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process, jeopardizing law \nenforcement access to information on international criminal and terrorist organizations. \n \nGuantanamo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 527 and \n528, which would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and \nfor the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees \nin the United States.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar \nprovisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions.  Operating \nthe detention facility at Guantanamo weakens U.S. national security by draining resources, \ndamaging U.S. relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  \nThese provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to \ndetermine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and \nwhere to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and \nU.S. national security interests.  Section 527 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-\nof-powers principles under certain circumstances. \n \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF).  The Administration strongly \nobjects to numerous provisions that would inhibit efforts to combat illegal gun activities, \nincluding unlawful trafficking, particularly where there has been little or no meaningful \nengagement with ATF on the provisions and their application.  The Administration also urges the \nCongress to repeal a number of other unnecessarily restrictive provisions made permanent in \nprior years. \n \nRestrictions on Foreign Relations with Cuba.  The bill includes unrelated language regarding \nCuban foreign policy, prohibiting funding to \"facilitate, permit, license, or promote exports to the \nCuban military or intelligence service.\" \n \nExecutive Office of the President \n \nU.S. Trade Representative (USTR).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the \nrequested funding level of $56.3 million for USTR.  The reduced funding level in the bill would \nlimit USTR's ability to conduct major trade negotiations, enforce trade agreements, and pursue \nnew and existing trade disputes. \n \n5  Legal Services Corporation (LSC) \n \nLegal Services Corporation.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's deep \nreductions to LSC, which would deny legal assistance to more than 350,000 low-income \nAmericans\u2014including military families and veterans\u2014and undercut the fundamental American \ncommitment to equal justice for all.  By reducing LSC's funding to the lowest level in 15 years, \nthe bill would cause layoffs of more than 1,000 staff, including more than 430 attorneys at local \nprograms, and the closure of 85 legal aid offices nationwide. \n \nInternational Trade Commission (ITC). \n \nThe Administration is concerned that the bill does not fully fund ITC's lease expiration and \nhousing plan.  The requested level provides necessary funds to reduce ITC's footprint, reduce \noperating and rent expenses, and achieve efficiencies in the long term. \n \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \n \nCommercial Crew Program.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee \nunderfunded NASA's Commercial Crew program by $243 million.  This would delay the date for \nlaunching U.S. astronauts to the space station with U.S. rockets and force a continued reliance on \nRussian capabilities, which currently require payments to Russia of approximately $500 million \nper year. \n \nSpace Technology.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget \nrequest for NASA Space Technology.  Compared to the request, the bill reduces funding for \nthese investments by $100 million, or 14 percent, delaying development of a cutting-edge laser \ncommunication system; advanced, high power solar electric propulsion; and other space \ntechnology demonstrations, slowing progress on the journey to Mars, and impacting the \ninternational competitiveness of the U.S. commercial space industry. \n \nEarth Science Missions.  The Administration opposes the bill\u2019s reductions of Earth Science by \nmore than $200 million, jeopardizing missions that are helping us respond to earthquakes, \ndroughts, and severe weather events and understand how the climate is changing.  The bill also \neliminates the launch of a key instrument used by western States to manage water supplies\u2014\nwhile at the same time adding $500 million above the requested level for the Space Launch \nSystem rocket. \n \nDigital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the \nCongress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request for NASA and the National Science \nFoundation to implement the DATA Act.  This funding will support the agencies' efforts to \nprovide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology \nsystems, changing business processes, and employing a uniform procurement instrument \nidentifier.  \n \nNational Science Foundation (NSF) \n \nTopline Funding.  The Administration strongly objects to the $7.4 billion funding level provided \nfor NSF.  This level is $329 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  The bill would lead to \nabout 600 fewer research grants, affecting about 7,900 researchers, technicians, and students.  \n6  Especially hard hit by this reduction would be the geosciences and social, behavioral, and \neconomic sciences, which would be reduced by 20 percent.  The Committee's allocation of \nresources to specific disciplines would interfere with NSF's ability to respond to scientific \nopportunity.  \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSeveral provisions in the bill, particularly sections 509, 519, 531, and 540, would raise \nconstitutional concerns in certain applications by intruding upon the President's constitutional \nauthority over international diplomacy.  The Administration looks forward to working with the \nCongress to address these constitutional concerns. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n7  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nMay 17, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5243 \u2013 Zika Response Appropriations Act, 2016 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act of \n2016.  The Zika virus poses a serious public health threat.  There is active, mosquito-borne \ntransmission of the Zika virus in approximately 50 countries, including U.S. Territories.  The \nZika virus is spreading in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and abroad, and \nthere will likely be mosquito-borne transmission within the continental United States in the \ncoming summer months.  As of May 11, 2016, there were more than 1,200 confirmed Zika cases \nin the continental United States and U.S. Territories, including over 110 pregnant women with \nconfirmed cases of the Zika virus.  Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC) recently concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal \nbrain defects.  In addition, researchers are investigating an association between the Zika virus \nand Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, neurological disorders, and other adverse health outcomes.   \n \nThe Administration is committed to taking necessary steps, as quickly as possible, to protect the \nAmerican people from the Zika virus.  In February, the Administration submitted to the Congress \na request for $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental funding.  In the absence of timely action \nfrom the Congress, the Administration redirected existing funds to scale up the urgent work \nnecessary to address the Zika virus.  However, the redirected funds can only temporarily address \nwhat is needed to support the full range of activities aimed at preventing, detecting, and \nresponding to further transmission of the Zika virus to protect the American public.   \n \nWhile the Administration appreciates that the Congress is finally taking action to address the \nZika virus, the funding provided in H.R. 5243 is woefully inadequate to support the response our \npublic health experts say is needed.  Specifically, the Administration's full request of $1.9 billion \nis needed to:  reduce the risk of the Zika virus, particularly in pregnant women, by better \ncontrolling the mosquitoes that spread Zika; develop new tools, including vaccines and better \ndiagnostics to protect the Nation from the Zika virus; and conduct crucial research projects \nneeded to better understand the impacts of the Zika virus on infants and children.    \n \nIn addition, the Administration objects to the bill's use of previously-appropriated funding as an \noffset.  Funding to fight the Zika virus should be treated as an emergency, the same as past \npublic health emergencies such as the Ebola and H1N1 viruses, and should not be \noffset.  Furthermore, rescinding additional funds previously designated for Ebola and other \nimportant initiatives such as critical infrastructure funding would harm the Nation's ability to \naddress a range of urgent, emerging, and ongoing health challenges.  Ebola remains a global \nhealth threat, as evidenced by recent cases in Guinea and Liberia, and Ebola funds must be \nreplenished to keep the disease from threatening our shores again.  The Administration also \nobjects to the bill's limitation on funding only through the end of fiscal year 2016.  The CDC \nexpects the health effects of the Zika virus to last beyond September 30, 2016, at which point the  Department of Health and Human Services would no longer have this funding for these activities \nand, given uncertainty around the disease, funding could run out even sooner.  Like prior \nemergencies, the effort to protect the American people from the Zika virus should not be funded \nincrementally. \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to provide full emergency supplemental funding at the \nlevel requested by the President.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5243, his senior \nadvisors would recommend he veto the bill.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n) \n                  May 19, 2015 \n                                                                                                                        (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH. R. 880 \u2013 American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Brady, R-TX, and 32 cosponsors)  \n \nThe Administration supports enhancing, simplifying, and making permanent the Research and \nExperimentation Credit (\"R&D credit\"), and offsetting the cost by closing tax loopholes.  The \nPresident's Budget proposes to do so as part of pro-growth business tax reform that is revenue \nneutral over the long term.  Making the R&D credit permanent will increase its effectiveness, \nsince it will allow businesses to make investments and create jobs today confident that they will \ncontinue to benefit from the credit in the future.  Moreover, four-fifths of the R&D credit is \nattributable to salaries of U.S. workers performing U.S.-based research\u2014meaning that the credit \nhelps create high-skilled jobs, as well as encouraging new innovations and future productivity. \n \nHowever, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 880, which would \npermanently extend and expand the R&D credit without offsetting the cost, adding to long-run \ndeficits.  By making the R&D credit permanent without offsets, H.R. 880 would add $180 billion \nto the deficit over the next 10 years.  H.R. 880 violates the very standard that House and Senate \nRepublicans approved less than a month ago in their concurrent budget resolution, which \nrequires offsetting the cost of any tax extenders that are made permanent with other revenue \nmeasures.  If the House passes H.R. 880, it will have approved nearly $600 billion in deficit-\nincreasing tax cuts mainly for corporations and wealthy estates this year \u2013 none of which are \nprovided for in the Republicans' own budget. \n \nAs with other similar proposals, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the \ndeficit to continue and expand costly tax breaks, while slashing investments and programs that \nserve middle class and working Americans in the name of fiscal rectitude.  If this same approach \nof making major tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional \ntax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits, wiping out most of the deficit \nreduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.  House Republicans also \nare making clear their priorities by rushing to make business tax cuts permanent without offsets \neven as the Republican Budget Resolution calls for raising taxes on about 25 million working \nfamilies and students by letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child \nTax Credit, and education tax credits expire. \n \nThe Administration wants to work with the Congress to make progress on measures that \nstrengthen the economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax \nreform.

Nunes, R-CA) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence\u2019s continued \nsupport of the Intelligence Community (IC) and its efforts to ensure that the IC has the tools it \nneeds to protect our national security.  The Administration supports a number of provisions in \nH.R. 2596, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, including the provision \nrelating to business system transformation and other technical and conforming provisions.  \nHowever, while there are areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration strongly \nobjects to several provisions of the bill.  If this bill were presented to the President, the \nPresident\u2019s senior advisors would recommend to the President that he veto it. \nThe Administration looks forward to reviewing the classified schedule of authorizations once it \nbecomes available and working with Congress to address classified authorization levels.  \nNevertheless, the President has been very clear about the core principle that he will not support a \nbudget that locks in sequestration, and he will not fix defense spending without fixing non-\ndefense spending.  Sequestration levels add risk to our national security by damaging the IC\u2019s \nability to provide strategic warning to decision-makers across all levels of government; to \nimprove collection technologies to exploit existing and future opportunities and increase \nresilience; to provide cutting-edge technical analysis of counterintelligence, cyber, advanced \nweapons, and proliferation threats; to spur IC integration; and to increase intelligence capacity by \ninvesting in critical information technologies.  The Administration would strongly object to a bill \nthat fails to authorize sufficient funding for the IC\u2019s priorities, and instead uses Overseas \nContingency Operations (OCO) funding in ways that leaders of both parties have made clear are \ninappropriate.  Shifting base budget resources into OCO risks undermining a mechanism meant \nto fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts and fails to provide a stable, multi-year budget on \nwhich defense and intelligence planning is based. The use of OCO funding to circumvent budget \ncaps in defense and intelligence spending also ignores the long-term connection between national \nsecurity and economic security and fails to account for vital national security functions carried \nout at non-defense agencies.   \nFurthermore, the President\u2019s national intelligence strategy depends on investing every dollar \nwhere it will have the greatest effect.  The Administration would object should the classified \nschedule of authorizations continue to authorize funding of unrequested, multi-billion dollar \nacquisition programs that would provide little new capability at the expense of core mission \nareas that address validated intelligence requirements.  The FY 2016 Budget includes a \nprioritized and balanced investment plan, and these extra programs create ripple effects across \nthe entire intelligence portfolio.   The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address the concerns outlined in \nmore detail below.   \nGuantanamo Detainee Provisions:  The Administration strongly objects to several provisions of \nthe bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  As the Administration has \nsaid many times before, operating this facility weakens our national security by draining \nresources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent \nextremists.  Rather than taking steps to bring this chapter of our history to a close, as the \nPresident has repeatedly called upon Congress to do, this bill aims to extend it.  Not only would \nit extend certain existing restrictions, it would impose an additional unwise and unnecessary \nrestriction that would further impede efforts to responsibly close the facility.  Sections 321 and \n322 would prohibit the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States or to \nconstruct or modify any facility in the United States to house detainees.  Section 323 would seek \nto prohibit certain foreign transfers entirely.  The Administration has objected to the inclusion of \nthese and similar provisions in prior legislation.  These restrictions are unwarranted and threaten \nto interfere with the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate disposition of \ndetainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts \nand circumstances of each case and our national security interests, and when and where to \ntransfer them consistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy.  Sections \n321 and 323 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under \ncertain circumstances, and section 323 could in some circumstances interfere with a detainee\u2019s \nright to the writ of habeas corpus.  In addition, sections 331 and 333 would require burdensome \nand unnecessary reporting to Congress and could interfere with the President\u2019s authority to \nprotect sensitive national security information. \nProhibition on Sharing of Certain Information in Response to Foreign Government Inquiries:  \nThe Administration strongly objects to section 308, which prohibits the IC from responding to, \nsharing, or authorizing the sharing of any non-public information related to an intelligence \nactivity carried out by the United States in response to a legislative or judicial inquiry from a \nforeign government into the intelligence activities of the United States.  This provision could \naffect our relationships with foreign partners and interferes with the President\u2019s authority to \nconduct foreign relations and control the dissemination of sensitive national security information.     \nCyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC):  The Administration is committed to \nestablishing the CTIIC as a robust element of the government\u2019s cyber capabilities, but objects to \nthe language in this bill concerning the CTIIC\u2019s role and responsibilities.  The Administration \nintends for the CTIIC to be a national intelligence center focused on \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d \nregarding malicious foreign cyber threats to the nation and cyber incidents affecting U.S. \nnational interests, and on providing reliable all-source analysis to U.S. policy makers.  This bill \nseeks to significantly expand CTIIC\u2019s roles and responsibilities beyond those contained in the \nPresident\u2019s February 25 memorandum directing the establishment of the CTIIC.  Further, the bill \ngives the CTIIC certain intelligence mission management functions already assigned elsewhere \nin the IC.  Given the rapidly changing nature of cyber threats to the United States, the CTIIC will \nrequire flexibility in executing its core functions.  Furthermore, the limits this bill would place on \nCTIIC\u2019s resources, and the expansive approach the bill would take with regard to CTIIC\u2019s \nmissions, are unnecessary and unwise, and would risk the CTIIC being unable to fully perform \nthe core functions assigned to it in the bill.  Instead, the Administration believes that \n2  responsibilities given to the CTIIC in the President\u2019s February 25 memorandum are appropriate \ngiven the need for the CTIIC to be a tailored, nimble organization that supports and enables the \nFederal government\u2019s efforts to identify, defend against, and respond to cyber threats.   \nReporting Requirements:  The Administration also objects to certain reporting requirements in \nthe bill.  For instance, section 303 would prohibit the use of funds to initiate any new special \naccess program unless the Director of National Intelligence or the Secretary of Defense submits a \nnotification to the congressional committees 30 days before initiating such program, subject to a \nlimited exception.  Such a requirement is unduly burdensome and does not offer the IC sufficient \nflexibility to efficiently manage special access programs while meeting the oversight needs of \nthe Congress.  The Administration also objects to section 332, which requires a report to \nCongress every 60 days for the next three years on foreign fighter flows to and from Syria.  \nThese provisions are unnecessary and overly burdensome and could, in certain circumstances, \ninterfere with the President\u2019s authority with regard to sensitive national security information.  \nThe Administration stands ready to work with Congress on possible alternatives.  The \nAdministration is committed to ensuring that the relevant committees have the information they \nneed for effective oversight of the IC and looks forward to working with Congress to address our \nconcerns with these provisions.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nFebruary 10, 2016      \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2017 - The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2015 \n(Rep.

Valadao, R-CA, and 26 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2898, the Western Water and American Food \nSecurity Act of 2015, because it fails to address critical elements of California's complex water \nchallenges and will, if enacted, impede an effective and timely response to the continuing \ndrought while providing no additional water to hard hit communities.  Like similar legislation in \nthe last Congress, H.R. 2898 was developed with little input from the public, the Administration, \nor key stakeholders affected by the drought.  The urgency and seriousness of the California \ndrought requires a balanced and flexible approach that promotes water reliability and ecosystem \nrestoration. \n \nSpecifically, H.R. 2898 dictates operational decisions and imposes a new legal standard which \ncould actually limit water supplies by creating new and confusing conflicts with existing laws, \nadding an unnecessary layer of complexity to Federal and State cooperation.  This additional \nstandard could slow decision-making, generate significantlitigation, and limit real-time \n \noperational flexibility critical to maximizing water delivery.  And, contrary to current and past \nFederal reclamation law that defers to State water law, the bill would preempt California water \nlaw.  \n \nIn addition, H.R. 2898 directs specific operations inconsistent with the Endangered Species Act \n(ESA), thereby resulting in conditions that could be detrimental to the Delta fish and other \nspecies listed under Federal and State endangered species laws. \n \nThe Administration strongly supports efforts to help alleviate the effects of drought in the West; \nhowever, the Administration is concerned with section 401, which establishes deadlines for \ncompleting feasibility studies for certain water storage projects.  The provision is unnecessary \nand the dates provided in the bill could prevent the participation of non-Federal partners in \ncertain studies and may inhibit the Administration's ability to consider a full range of options for \naddressing these issues.  In addition, financial penalties levied upon the Bureau of Reclamation \nunder section 403 for not meeting these deadlines would only undermine the Department of the \nInterior's ability to help address the effects of drought in the West. \n \nMuch of the bill contains provisions that have little connection to the ongoing drought.  The bill \nincludes language constraining the Administration's ability to protect the commercial and tribal \nfishery on the Trinity and Klamath Rivers, which will have impacts not just in California, but \nthroughout the west coast.  The bill would also repeal the San Joaquin River Settlement \nAgreement, which the Congress enacted to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation.  Full repeal \nof the settlement agreement would likely result in the resumption of costly litigation, creating an  uncertain future for river restoration and water delivery operations for water users on the San \nJoaquin River. \n \nCalifornians are facing significant drought-related challenges.  This is why the Administration \nhas directed Federal agencies to work with state and local officials in real-time to maximize \nlimited water supplies, prioritize public health and safety, meet state water quality requirements, \nand ensure a balanced approach to providing for the water needs of people, agriculture, \nbusinesses, power, imperiled species and the environment.  Consistent with the 2015 Interagency \nDrought Strategy, the Administration and Federal agencies have partnered with state agencies in \nCalifornia to improve coordination of water operations in the state. In June, the Administration \nannounced new actions and investments of more than $110 million to support workers, farmers, \nand rural communities suffering from drought and to combat wildfires.  This builds on the more \nthan $190 million that agencies across the Federal government have invested to support drought-\nstricken communities so far this year.  Unfortunately, H.R. 2898 would undermine these efforts \nand the progress that has been made. \n \nFor these reasons, if the President were presented with H.R. 2898, his senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n                    July 6, 2016 \n                    (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY  \nS. 2193 \u2013 Kate's Law \n(Sen. Cruz, R-TX, and eight cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes S. 2193.  The bill fails to offer the comprehensive reforms \nneeded to fix the Nation's broken immigration laws and would impose severe and unprecedented \nmandatory minimum sentences that would undermine the discretion of Federal judges to make \nsure the punishment fits the crime in each case. \n \nThe Administration continues to believe that it is critical to fix the Nation's broken immigration \nsystem through comprehensive commonsense legislation that builds on existing efforts to \nstrengthen border security, cracks down on employers hiring undocumented workers, streamlines \nlegal immigration, increases the efficiency of the immigration court system, and offers an earned \npath to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to get right with the law if they pass \nbackground checks, contribute to the Nation's economy by paying taxes, and go to the back of \nthe line.  While the Senate passed comprehensive legislation with strong bipartisan support over \nthree years ago that would do just that, the House of Representatives failed to take any action.  \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bipartisan Senate bill would grow the \nNation's economy by 5.4 percent and reduce Federal deficits by nearly $1 trillion over 20 years.  \nThe Administration continues to urge the Congress to address all of the problems with the \nNation's broken immigration system and take up commonsense legislation that will offer \nmeaningful solutions to those problems.  \n \nThis piecemeal legislation does not offer those kinds of reforms.  Those who reenter our country \nwithout authorization are already subject to substantial criminal penalties, and these proposed \nmandatory minimums are arbitrary, severe, and unprecedented.  The Congress should not \nundermine the discretion of judges to apply existing law and to impose penalties that fit the \ncrime in each individual case.  Rather than focusing on this misguided legislation, the Congress \nshould support the Administration's ongoing efforts to secure the border and keep our Nation \nsafe. \n \nThe Administration has taken unprecedented steps to achieve those goals.  For example, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) has deployed historic levels of front-line personnel, \ntechnology, and infrastructure to the border to reduce the flow of unlawful migration and illicit \ncontraband while fostering legal trade and travel.  DHS is pursuing a Department-wide strategy \nthat marshals resources from across the agency along the Southern Border and draws on \nexperienced law enforcement officials.  The Department has put in place effective new \nenforcement priorities to ensure that its limited resources are focused on apprehending, \ndetaining, and removing the worst offenders\u2014national security threats, convicted criminals, \ngang members, and recent border crossers.  Finally, DHS and the Department of Justice have put \nin place new procedures to reinforce the process for the detention and removal of immigrants \nwho are serving sentences within the Federal corrections system.  Today, over 99 percent of  those in immigration detention fit within one of the enforcement priorities, and 91 percent of all \ninterior removals in FY 2015 were convicted criminals.

Enhanced small business expensing supports small businesses in making \ninvestments and creating jobs.  The President's Budget would allow small businesses to \nimmediately write off up to $1 million in investments, while also proposing other measures to \nsimplify and cut taxes for small businesses.  \n \nHowever, as with other similar proposals, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of \nH.R. 636, which would permanently extend and expand the current expensing provisions for \nsmall businesses, as well as two other current provisions that offer tax breaks for S-corporations, \nwithout offsetting the cost, adding to long-run deficits.

House Republicans are making clear \ntheir priorities by rushing to make business tax cuts permanent without offsets when key tax \ncredit improvements benefiting 16 million working families with children are scheduled to \nexpire.

Huizenga, R-MI, and one cosponsor) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5711, a bill that would prevent the United States from \nimplementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a diplomatic arrangement that \npeacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  The bill would \nundermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA commitments by effectively \nprohibiting the United States from licensing the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran for \nexclusively civil end uses, as we committed to do in the JCPOA, and seeking to deter companies \nfrom pursuing permissible business with Iran.  The JCPOA has significantly constrained Iran's \nnuclear program \u2013 key aspects of the program are dismantled under the JCPOA, and it subjects \nIran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements.  It is \nprofoundly in the national security interest of the United States to continue to meet our \ncommitments under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its commitments. \n \nThe bill prohibits the U.S. government from authorizing transactions by U.S. financial \ninstitutions in connection with the export or re-export of commercial passenger aircraft to the \nGovernment of Iran or Iranian entities and mandates the revocation of any such licenses already \nissued.  Without the ability to license these transactions, the United States will be unable to fulfill \none of its JCPOA commitments to the detriment of U.S. companies, foreign partners, and the \nworld.  The commitment to license these transactions, clearly outlined in the JCPOA text, has \nbeen clear since the conclusion of the JCPOA in July 2015 and as briefed publicly by this \nAdministration, including during the robust congressional debate on the JCPOA.  Attempts at \nthis juncture to preclude implementation of U.S. commitments are in bad faith.  \n \nThe bill further limits the role of Export-Import Bank financing by mandating vague restrictions \nwith potentially undefined impact on commerce.  For example, the bill requires the Export-\nImport Bank to cancel any financial assistance issued post-enactment that has \"facilitated\" the \nexport, sale, or lease of an aircraft to Iran or an Iranian entity.  The sweeping and vague nature of \nthis provision would have a chilling effect on U.S. and non-U.S. entities seeking to engage in \npermissible business with Iran.   \n \nThis bill, if enacted, would contravene U.S. commitments in the JCPOA and interfere with its \nsuccessful implementation.  The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our \ncommitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our \ncredibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon \nin implementing the JCPOA. We fully expect that, if these measures became law, our closest \nallies would view this bill as a violation of our JCPOA commitments and Iran would take the \nissue to the Joint Commission.

Luetkemeyer, R-MO, and 11 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort to modernize and improve Federal housing \nprograms in H.R. 3700, the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act of 2015. \n \nH.R. 3700 contains provisions that would modify several programs administered by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including core rental assistance \nprograms (Housing Choice Vouchers, Public Housing, and Project-Based Rental Assistance), \nhomelessness prevention and assistance programs, and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) \nmortgage insurance for condominiums.  H.R. 3700 also amends the Rural Housing Service \nprogram in the Department of Agriculture.   \n \nH.R. 3700 includes provisions that would help streamline the administration of HUD programs, \nparticularly with respect to income determination for tenants and housing quality inspections for \nassisted rental housing.  The bill also would expand flexibility between public housing operating \nand capital funds, and would provide additional flexibility to public housing agencies to \nconditionally approve housing voucher units with non-life threatening deficiencies in order to \nallow families immediate access.  Although the Administration has supported many of the bill's \nreforms in previous Budgets, some of the provisions could potentially increase administrative \nburden and have unintended consequences.   \n \nH.R. 3700 would ease restrictions on the purchase of condominiums with FHA insurance.  While \ngenerally supportive of the revisions to the condominium project approval requirements, the \nAdministration is concerned with the delegation of the authority to grant exceptions to HUD \nrequirements to the lenders approving projects under the Direct Endorsement Lender Review and \nApproval Process.  The delegation does not appear to provide HUD with sufficient ability to set \nstandards for exceptions and oversee their application.  Furthermore, other FHA requirements in \nthe bill may create future difficulties for HUD in implementing timely and consistent program \nchanges in response to market conditions.  \n \nThe bill also would provide the Secretary of Agriculture with the authority to delegate some loan \nguarantee approval and execution functions under the guaranteed rural housing loan program, \nwhich should streamline those loans and speed up processing times. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on continuing to improve the \nbill as it moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n     \n       \n  July 6, 2016 \n                    (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 3100 \u2013 Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act \n(Sen. Toomey, R-PA, and Sen. Inhofe, R-OK) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes S. 3100.  This bill fails to offer comprehensive reforms \nneeded to fix the Nation's broken immigration laws, and undermines current Administration \nefforts to remove the most dangerous convicted criminals and national security threats, and to \nwork collaboratively with State and local law enforcement agencies.  \n \nThe Administration continues to believe that it is critical to fix the Nation's broken immigration \nsystem through comprehensive commonsense legislation that builds on existing efforts to \nstrengthen border security, cracks down on employers hiring undocumented workers, streamlines \nlegal immigration, increases the efficiency of the immigration court system, and offers an earned \npath to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to get right with the law if they pass \nbackground checks, contribute to the Nation's economy by paying taxes, and go to the back of \nthe line.  While the Senate passed comprehensive legislation with strong bipartisan support over \nthree years ago that would do just that, the House of Representatives failed to take any action.  \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bipartisan Senate bill would grow the \nNation's economy by 5.4 percent and reduce Federal deficits by nearly $1 trillion over 20 years.  \nThe Administration continues to urge the Congress to address all of the problems with the \nNation's broken immigration system and take up commonsense legislation that will offer \nmeaningful solutions to those problems.  \n \nThe Administration also believes the most effective way to enhance public safety is through \nsensible and effective policies that focus enforcement resources on the most significant public \nsafety threats.  The Administration has put in place new enforcement priorities that accomplish \nthis important law enforcement goal by focusing limited resources on the worst offenders \u2013 \nincluding national security threats, convicted criminals, and gang members.  The effectiveness of \nthese new priorities depends on collaboration between Federal, State, and local law enforcement.  \nEvery day, the Federal government fosters State and local collaboration through a variety of \nmechanisms, including policies, programs, and joint task forces.  The Department of Homeland \nSecurity's (DHS) Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) enables Federal immigration enforcement \nto work with State and local law enforcement to take custody of individuals who are enforcement \npriorities before those individuals are released into communities.  PEP builds collaboration \nbetween Federal, State, and local law enforcement that allows for the most effective enforcement \nwhile enhancing community policing and trust. It is not a \"one-size-fits all\" approach.  These \nefforts are producing results.  Today, over 99 percent of those in immigration detention fit within \none of the enforcement priorities, and 91 percent of all interior removals in FY 2015 were \nconvicted criminals.  Additionally, the vast majority of the Nation\u2019s approximately 3,100 local \nlaw enforcement agencies are collaborating with DHS.  This bill would directly undermine these  efforts and undo the progress made in building trust between Federal, State and local law \nenforcement in focusing our resources on threats to public safety.  \n \nS. 3100 would also jeopardize the ability of State and local governments to receive Federal \nfunding that is critical to their efforts to grow and revitalize their communities.  For some \njurisdictions, it would deny funding for cities to implement a wide range of community \ndevelopment, infrastructure, and housing activities and provide vital public services, including \nmeals to the elderly and affordable child care for low-income, working families.  The bill also \nwould deem State and local law enforcement officials to act as the agents of Federal immigration \nlaw enforcement\u2014and to have the authority of Federal immigration law enforcement officials\u2014 \nin certain circumstances.  The Administration believes that these provisions would lead to \nmistrust between communities and State and local law enforcement agencies; undermine the \nability of law enforcement to keep communities safe across the country; and impede our efforts \nto safely, fairly, and effectively enforce the Nation's immigration laws.  \n \nIf the President were presented with S. 3100, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the \nbill.  \n \n* * * * * * *  \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nFebruary 2, 2016    \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1675 \u2013 Capital Markets Improvement Act of 2016 \n(Rep. Hultgren, R-IL, and 8 cosponsors)  \n   \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1675.  Among other flaws, this bill includes several \nprovisions that pose risks to investors, are overly broad, allow financial institutions to avoid \nappropriate oversight, and are duplicative of existing administrative authorities.  \n \nTitle III, entitled Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage Simplification, is \noverly broad and would eliminate registration requirements for merger and acquisition (M&A) \nbrokers engaged on a transaction for any privately held company with gross revenues up to $250 \nmillion, thus exempting deals of significant size, and for businesses far bigger than the local \nsmall businesses the bill purports to aid.  Moreover, the legislation is duplicative insofar as the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already taken administrative action to exempt \ncertain M&A brokers from broker-dealer registration without hindering the agency's ability to \nprotect investors.  \n \nAdditionally, Title IV, entitled Small Company Disclosure Simplification, would exempt certain \npublicly traded companies from requirements to file machine-readable financial statements.  \nOpen data disclosure systems benefit investors, issuers, and the public, increasing transparency \nof publicly traded companies by making their filings more easily accessible.  Impeding \nregulators' ability to use 21st century technological tools to regulate markets and protect investors \nis contrary to the SEC's mission.  \n \nLastly, Title V, entitled Streamlining Excessive and Costly Regulations Review, would require \nthe SEC to periodically review all of its existing significant regulations and determine by \nCommission vote whether each regulation is outdated, among other requirements.  These \nrequirements are unnecessarily duplicative, wasteful and costly.  The SEC already complies with \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act and is encouraged, under Executive Order 13579, to review rules \nto assess whether they are outdated or excessively burdensome.  Requiring a review and full \nCommission vote on every major rule every 10 years under full Administrative Procedure Act-\nstyle requirements would severely hinder the SEC's ability to monitor markets and protect \ninvestors.  \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 1675, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \nOctober 1, 2015 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2029 \u2013 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2016 \n(Sen. Cochran, R-MS) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of H.R. 2029, making appropriations for \nmilitary construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The bill fails to fully fund critical priorities, \nincluding veterans' medical care and military construction.  Furthermore, the legislation includes \na highly problematic ideological rider that would constrain the President's ability to protect our \nnational security.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2029, his senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto the bill. \n \nEnacting H.R. 2029, while adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending \nlimits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-\nclass priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to \nthreaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be \nmotivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The \nRepublican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both nondefense and defense \nto the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts would result \nin tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, \nmillions fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and drastic cuts to \nscientific research awards and grants, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the \nmiddle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class. \n \nMaintaining sequestration would also negatively impact programs that provide important \nservices to our Nation's veterans and are funded in appropriations bills where Republicans \npropose to make even deeper cuts relative to the President's Budget than in H.R. 2029.  For \nexample, American Job Centers serve 1.2 million veterans annually, including 300,000 who \nreceive intensive employment services.  Transition assistance provides 200,000 service members \neach year with employment guidance and information as they prepare to enter the civilian \nworkforce.  And hundreds of thousands of veterans rely on a wide range of Department of \nHousing and Urban Development programs for housing support and homeless assistance each \nyear. \n \nSequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only \nthrough pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland \nSecurity, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of \nour economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear \nthat he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense \nwithout also fixing non-defense. \n  The President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2029 and any other \nlegislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the \ninvestments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense \npriorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members \nof Congress from both parties have urged.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill. \n \nVeterans Affairs Medical Care.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the \nNation's veterans; however the Administration objects to the Committee's overall $470 million \nreduction to the FY 2016 Budget request for Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Care.  If enacted, \nthis reduction would negatively impact medical care services for tens of thousands of veterans \nand reduce VA's ability to activate new and replacement facilities with sufficient staff and \nequipment and to adequately maintain facility infrastructure. \n \nMilitary Construction.  The Administration objects to the Committee's $355 million reduction to \nmilitary construction compared to the FY 2016 Budget request, which would delay or defer \nprojects that serve critical needs for members of our Armed Forces and their families.  The \nprojects requested in the FY 2016 Budget reflect the highest priority projects for the Department \nof Defense, and the Administration requests full funding for each project. \n \nVeterans Affairs Construction.  The Administration objects to the Committee's $117 million \nreduction to the FY 2016 Budget request for VA major construction.  This reduction would \nprevent building upgrades and renovations, including necessary expansions to medical facilities \nand national cemeteries that would improve services to veterans.  The funding level provided in \nthe bill would constrain VA's ability to make progress on its highest priority capital projects. \n \nDetainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to section 410 of the bill, which prohibits \nthe use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house \nindividuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This provision would constrain the \nflexibility that the Executive Branch needs to be able to determine the appropriate disposition of \ndetainees, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests. \n \nDigital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Congress fully funded the \nFY 2016 Budget request for the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue support of a digital \nservice team.  This funding will support efforts to manage digital services that have the greatest \nimpact on citizens and businesses. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSeveral provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, section 113 of the bill \nmay interfere with the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief and section 244 may \nconstitute a bill of attainder. \n \n \n \n \n2  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  July 11, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5631 \u2013 Iran Accountability Act of 2016 \n(Rep.

Pompeo, R-KS, and 32 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5631, H.R. 4992, and H.R. 5119, bills that would \nprevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \n(JCPOA).  These bills would undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA \ncommitments by reimposing certain secondary economic and financial sanctions lifted on \n\"Implementation Day\" of the JCPOA \u2013 the day on which the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) verified Iran's completion of key nuclear-related steps. The JCPOA has \nsignificantly constrained Iran's nuclear program, including through the dismantlement of key \naspects of the program, and subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and \nmonitoring requirements.  It is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States to \ncontinue to meet our commitments under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its \ncommitments.   \n \nH.R. 5631 includes provisions that would prevent the Administration from implementing certain \nU.S. sanctions relief commitments under the JCPOA on the basis of non-nuclear related activity \nby Iran.  Specifically, the legislation would require the reimposition of sanctions on individuals \nand entities delisted on Implementation Day, as well as the re-imposition of financial and \neconomic secondary sanctions lifted on Implementation Day, including sanctions on prominent \nIranian economic sectors, such as the petrochemical sector.  In addition, this bill lacks flexibility \nincluding new waiver authorities as has typically been provided for new robust sanctions \nmeasures for continued use of sanctions in furtherance of our national security and foreign policy \nobjectives.   \n \nH.R. 4992 contravenes United States commitments in the JCPOA, as it would reapply secondary \nsanctions on Iran's financial sector by prohibiting permissible financial transactions between Iran \nand the international community that are wholly outside the U.S. financial system.  This would \namount to a harmful and unnecessary overreach, undermining the President's exercise of \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authority.  As the Administration has \nbeen clear, the United States will continue to impose our primary trade embargo on Iran, with \ncertain limited exceptions set forth in the JCPOA, and take robust measures to protect the U.S. \nfinancial system from access by Iran.  However, this bill seeks to directly undermine Iran's \nconduct of banking transactions outside of the United States \u2013 activity that became permissible \non Implementation Day in return for Iran meeting its nuclear-related commitments, as verified by \nthe IAEA.  \n  H.R. 5119 includes provisions that would foreclose the United States from procuring heavy \nwater from Iran in the future.  Removal of excess heavy water from Iran denies Iran access to \nmaterial that could be stockpiled for potential nuclear weapons production while also providing \nthe international market access to an important commodity for research and non-nuclear \nindustries.  As part of the JCPOA, Iran committed to a limit on the amount of heavy water that it \ncould accumulate, but may sell its excess heavy water, further ensuring that Iran does not use this \nproduct to develop material for a nuclear weapon.  The United States does not produce heavy \nwater.  For U.S. industry and research labs, heavy water is a critical material used for biomedical \nand diagnostic research \u2013 such as MRIs and pharmaceutical development \u2013 as well as for \nchemistry, physics and environmental analysis. \n \nThese bills, separately or collectively, thus would impact the continued viability of the JCPOA, a \ndiplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear \nweapon. Dismantling the JCPOA would remove the unprecedented constraints on and \nmonitoring of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime \nagainst Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership and our \ncommitments to our closest allies.  \n \nAs we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, \nthe Administration remains clear-eyed regarding Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile \nprogram, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region. The United States retains \nall of the tools it needs to counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to \ndisrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and proliferation-sensitive technologies.  In \naddition, the United States remains committed to supporting our regional partners' enhancement \nof their defense capabilities and will continue our steadfast vigilance in enforcing multilateral \nexport controls regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).   \n \nContinued implementation of JCPOA commitments by all participants \u2013 including the United \nStates and our closest allies \u2013 is critical to ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain \nexclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States \nand the international community.  \n \nThe President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful \nimplementation of the JCPOA.

The Administration therefore strongly opposes H.R. \n3189. \n \nThe Federal Reserve is an independent entity designed to be free from political pressures, and its \nindependence is key to its credibility and its ability to act in the long-term interest of the Nation's \neconomic health.  One of the most problematic provisions in the bill would require the \nComptroller General to audit the conduct of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board and \nthe Federal Open Market Committee.  The operations of the Federal Reserve are already subject \nto numerous audit requirements that ensure it is accountable to the Congress and the American \npeople.  The only aspect of the Federal Reserve's operations not subject to audit is its monetary \npolicy decision-making, and for good reason.  Subjecting the Federal Reserve's exercise of \nmonetary policy authority to audits based on political whims of members of the Congress\u2014of \neither party\u2014threatens one of the central pillars of the Nation's financial system and economy, \nand would almost certainly have negative impacts on the Federal Reserve's work to promote \nprice stability and full employment.   \n \nH.R. 3189 also would impose numerous, burdensome requirements for the Federal Reserve \nBoard rulemaking authorities, including the imposition of a duplicative requirement that the \nFederal Reserve Board undertake a proscriptive cost-benefit analysis and a post-adoption impact \nassessment when promulgating rules.  When a Federal agency, including an independent agency \nsuch as the Federal Reserve, promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust \nsubstantive and procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure \nAct, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional \nReview Act, among other statutes.  Additionally, Executive Order 13579 encourages \nindependent regulatory agencies to conduct reasoned cost-benefit analysis, engage in public \nparticipation to the extent feasible, and conduct a systematic retrospective review of regulations.  \nThe provisions in this bill, therefore, would create unnecessary, duplicative, and onerous \nrequirements for an entity tasked with ensuring the financial safety and soundness of the Nation's \nfinancial system.   \n \nIn addition, the bill would add a number of procedural hurdles that would impede the Federal \nReserve's ability to engage with international regulatory bodies and divert its resources to \nunnecessary reporting requirements.  These provisions, along with provisions imposing parallel \nnotification and consultation requirements on several other Executive Branch entities, could  impair the President's exercise of his exclusive constitutional authority to conduct the Nation's \ndiplomatic relations. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 3189, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n July 5, 2016 \n \n(House Rules)\nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4361 - Federal Information Systems Safeguards Act of 2016  \n(Rep. Palmer, R-AL, and one cosponsor) \n \nThe Administration is strongly committed to upholding the highest accountability standards for \nFederal agencies and the Federal workforce, including strict standards to ensure that employees \nact in the best interests of the American people, and we appreciate the Congress' attention to \ngovernment reform and oversight efforts.  However, certain sections of this legislation would \nweaken the rights of Federal employees, and be impractical and administratively burdensome to \nimplement.  They would also have harmful unintended consequences, while failing to address \nthe issues they are designed to solve and while raising serious constitutional concerns.  Because \nof this, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4361 as considered by the Rules Committee.  \n \nThe Administration believes that the approach to accountability in certain provisions of the \nlegislation is misguided.  For example, H.R. 4361 would require expedited removal procedures \nfor agency senior executives that would raise significant constitutional concerns under the \nAppointments Clause and the Due Process Clause.  These procedures impose a time-constricted \ncase review and appeal process that would permit administrative judges who are not appointed in \na constitutionally appropriate manner to render removal decisions, would make those decisions \nfinal if the administrative judges fail to act within 21 days, and would deny any review of the \ndecisions of the administrative judges by the Merit Systems Protection Board.  These procedures \nare substantially the same as those in section 707 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and \nAccountability Act of 2014, which the Department of Justice notified the Congress in May of \nthis year could not be defended against constitutional challenge.  These provisions would \nsignificantly alter and diminish important rights and protections that are available to the vast \nmajority of other employees across the government and that are essential to safeguarding \nemployees' rights.  Moreover, these provisions would hamper the Federal government's efforts to \nattract and retain top talent committed to serving in the Senior Executive Service.    \n \nThe requirements for mandatory senior executive reassignment would be problematic to \nimplement as written, and duplicative of existing efforts.  Under a December 2015 Executive \nOrder, \"Strengthening the Senior Executive Service,\" agencies are already required to develop \nand implement a senior executive rotation plan.  The Executive Order provides a more \nproductive approach that considers the agencies' talent and succession management plans, as \nwell as the executive\u2019s individual development plan. \n \nThe bill would require the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to report on the use of union \nofficial time across the Executive Branch on matters not currently covered in existing OPM \nreporting.  The additional requirements are subjective and virtually impossible to \nmeasure.  These additional, burdensome requirements would have to be manually gathered for \napproximately 2,000 local bargaining units across the Executive Branch, making it challenging, \nif not impossible, to meet the statutory deadlines established by the bill.   \nIn addition to objectionable personnel policy provisions, this bill would set policy that would \nundermine existing government-wide cybersecurity and records management \npolicies.  Amending individual agency records management practices is unnecessary and would \nset a problematic precedent, as the Federal Records Act already provides clear, transparent, and \neffective requirements for managing Federal records.   \n \nFinally, the \"Midnight Rule\" provisions in this bill would infringe on the powers of the President \nto faithfully execute the laws in the final months of the term.  They would arbitrarily prohibit the \nissuance of key rules and thus prevent the implementation of laws passed by the Congress \nthrough otherwise lawful, well-justified, and beneficial regulations, and would also subject the \nrulemaking process to additional, unnecessary judicial review provisions. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4361, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n                    October 20, 2015 \n                    (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY  \nS. 2146 \u2013 Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act \n(Sen.

The Administration has put in place new enforcement priorities that accomplish \nthis important law enforcement goal by focusing limited resources on the worst offenders \u2013 \nnational security threats, convicted criminals, gang members, and recent border crossers.  The \neffectiveness of these new priorities depends on collaboration between Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement.  Every day, the Federal government fosters State and local collaboration \nthrough a variety of mechanisms, including policies, programs, and joint task forces.  The \nDepartment of Homeland Security's (DHS) Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) enables Federal \nimmigration enforcement to work with State and local law enforcement to take custody of \nindividuals who are enforcement priorities, including public safety and national security threats, \nbefore those individuals are released into communities.  PEP is a balanced, commonsense \napproach to enforcing the Nation's immigration laws.  It replaced the Secure Communities \nprogram, which, by establishing a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to State and local cooperation \nwith Federal immigration enforcement officials, discouraged some localities from turning over \ndangerous individuals to DHS custody.  Secure Communities was embroiled in litigation and \nwidely criticized for undermining State and local community policing efforts.  PEP builds \ncollaboration between Federal, State, and local law enforcement that allows for the most \neffective enforcement while enhancing community policing and trust.  The vast majority of the \nNation\u2019s approximately 3,100 local law enforcement agencies are collaborating with DHS  through the PEP program, and more than half of the approximately 340 jurisdictions that \npreviously declined to cooperate with DHS are now working with DHS under PEP.  The \nCongress should give PEP a chance to work, instead of displacing that collaborative approach\u2014\nwhich prioritizes the worst offenders\u2014with the coercive approach of this bill, which makes no \nsuch differentiation. \n \nThe bill would also jeopardize the ability of State and local governments to receive Federal \nfunding that is critical to their efforts to ensure public safety and to tackle serious problems \nfacing their communities.  For some jurisdictions, it would deny funding for cities to implement \na wide range of community development and housing activities, including public safety \nenhancements and neighborhood-based community policing efforts and investments to increase \naccess to affordable housing, and eliminate blight and support neighborhood planning.  The bill \nwould also essentially turn State and local law enforcement into Federal immigration law \nenforcement officials, in certain circumstances.  The Administration believes that these \nprovisions would lead to mistrust between communities and State and local law enforcement \nagencies; undermine the ability of law enforcement to keep communities safe across the country; \nand impede our efforts to safely, fairly, and effectively enforce the Nation's immigration laws. \n \nIf the President were presented with S. 2146, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthis bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n   January 12, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 240 \u2013 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 \n(Rep.

Among other protections, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Qualified \nMortgage (QM) rule requires a lender to make a good faith effort to determine that a borrower \nhas the ability to repay a mortgage, and that the loan does not include excessive upfront points \nand fees.  The final rule also contains special provisions and exemptions that are available only \nto small lenders or to small lenders that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas.  \n \nH.R. 1210 would broaden the definition of qualified mortgages \u2013 those that qualify for the safe \nharbor \u2013 to include all mortgages held on a lender's balance sheet.  Under the bill, depository \ninstitutions that hold a loan in portfolio would receive a legal safe harbor even if the loan \ncontains terms and features that are abusive and harmful to consumers.  The bill would limit the \nright of borrowers to file claims against holders of such loans and against mortgage originators \nwho directed them to the loans.  H.R. 1210 also would open the door to risky lending by \nallowing balloon loans made in any geographic area to qualify for the safe harbor as long as they \nare held in portfolio. \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes this bill because it would undermine critical consumer \nprotections by exempting all depository financial institutions, large and small, from QM \nstandards\u2014including very basic standards like verifying a consumer's income\u2014as long as the \nmortgage loans in question are held in portfolio by the institution.

These bills would undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA \ncommitments by reimposing certain secondary economic and financial sanctions lifted on \n\"Implementation Day\" of the JCPOA \u2013 the day on which the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA) verified Iran's completion of key nuclear-related steps. The JCPOA has \nsignificantly constrained Iran's nuclear program, including through the dismantlement of key \naspects of the program, and subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and \nmonitoring requirements.  It is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States to \ncontinue to meet our commitments under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its \ncommitments.   \n \nH.R. 5631 includes provisions that would prevent the Administration from implementing certain \nU.S. sanctions relief commitments under the JCPOA on the basis of non-nuclear related activity \nby Iran.  Specifically, the legislation would require the reimposition of sanctions on individuals \nand entities delisted on Implementation Day, as well as the re-imposition of financial and \neconomic secondary sanctions lifted on Implementation Day, including sanctions on prominent \nIranian economic sectors, such as the petrochemical sector.  In addition, this bill lacks flexibility \nincluding new waiver authorities as has typically been provided for new robust sanctions \nmeasures for continued use of sanctions in furtherance of our national security and foreign policy \nobjectives.   \n \nH.R. 4992 contravenes United States commitments in the JCPOA, as it would reapply secondary \nsanctions on Iran's financial sector by prohibiting permissible financial transactions between Iran \nand the international community that are wholly outside the U.S. financial system.  This would \namount to a harmful and unnecessary overreach, undermining the President's exercise of \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authority.  As the Administration has \nbeen clear, the United States will continue to impose our primary trade embargo on Iran, with \ncertain limited exceptions set forth in the JCPOA, and take robust measures to protect the U.S. \nfinancial system from access by Iran.  However, this bill seeks to directly undermine Iran's \nconduct of banking transactions outside of the United States \u2013 activity that became permissible \non Implementation Day in return for Iran meeting its nuclear-related commitments, as verified by \nthe IAEA.  \n  H.R. 5119 includes provisions that would foreclose the United States from procuring heavy \nwater from Iran in the future.  Removal of excess heavy water from Iran denies Iran access to \nmaterial that could be stockpiled for potential nuclear weapons production while also providing \nthe international market access to an important commodity for research and non-nuclear \nindustries.  As part of the JCPOA, Iran committed to a limit on the amount of heavy water that it \ncould accumulate, but may sell its excess heavy water, further ensuring that Iran does not use this \nproduct to develop material for a nuclear weapon.  The United States does not produce heavy \nwater.  For U.S. industry and research labs, heavy water is a critical material used for biomedical \nand diagnostic research \u2013 such as MRIs and pharmaceutical development \u2013 as well as for \nchemistry, physics and environmental analysis. \n \nThese bills, separately or collectively, thus would impact the continued viability of the JCPOA, a \ndiplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear \nweapon. Dismantling the JCPOA would remove the unprecedented constraints on and \nmonitoring of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime \nagainst Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership and our \ncommitments to our closest allies.  \n \nAs we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, \nthe Administration remains clear-eyed regarding Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile \nprogram, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region. The United States retains \nall of the tools it needs to counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to \ndisrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and proliferation-sensitive technologies.  In \naddition, the United States remains committed to supporting our regional partners' enhancement \nof their defense capabilities and will continue our steadfast vigilance in enforcing multilateral \nexport controls regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).   \n \nContinued implementation of JCPOA commitments by all participants \u2013 including the United \nStates and our closest allies \u2013 is critical to ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain \nexclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States \nand the international community.  \n \nThe President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful \nimplementation of the JCPOA.

Provisions of the bill could be interpreted to prevent EPA \nfrom taking important, and possibly legally required, actions, where supporting data is not \npublicly available, and legal challenges could delay important environmental and health \nprotections.  For example, the data underlying some scientifically-important studies is not made \nbroadly available in order to protect the privacy of test subjects, and modeling that EPA uses for \na variety of purposes are not EPA property and therefore cannot be publicly released.  H.R. 1030 \ncould interfere with EPA's ability to take actions based on such data.  In short, the bill would \nundermine EPA's ability to protect the health of Americans, would impose expensive new \nmandates on EPA, and could impose substantial litigation costs on the Federal government.  It \nalso could impede EPA's reliance on the best available science. \nInstead of an overly broad bill that would tie EPA's hands, the Administration urges the \nCongress to support the Administration's efforts to make scientific and technical information \nmore accessible and regulations more transparent.

The \nRules Committee Print of H.R. 2357 contains the text of H.R. 2357 as reported (Title I), as well \nas texts of H.R. 4850, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, as reported (Title II), and H.R. 4852, \nthe Private Placement Improvement Act, as reported (Title III).  Markets function most \nefficiently when they are transparent, well-regulated, and trusted by investors and issuers alike.  \nThese bills would reduce transparency and inhibit effective regulatory oversight of our capital \nmarkets by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  These bills would undermine not \nonly the health and integrity of our markets, but the very capital formation process they claim to \npromote.  \n \nH.R. 2357 (Title I) would weaken investor protections by reducing the quality or availability of \ninformation needed to make informed investment decisions.  By compelling the SEC to amend \nForm S-3, the bill would: (1) allow microcap companies traded on an exchange to issue an \nunlimited number of shares using shelf registration within a 12-month period; and (2) permit \nunlisted microcap companies, including those listed on the \"pink sheets,\" with less than $75 \nmillion in common equity to sell up to 1/3 of the market value of their common equity using \nshelf registration in a 12-month period.  This bill would harm investors by reducing disclosure \nrequirements and infringe on the SEC's ability to appropriately respond to market developments.  \nSuch changes would increase the risks posed by accounting fraud, market manipulation, insider \ntrading, and the sale of artificially-inflated stock.   \n \nH.R. 4850 (Title II) would similarly undermine investor protections and the integrity of capital \nformation for small businesses.  Specifically, the bill eliminates all existing investor protections \nfor crowdfunding and Regulation A offerings, provided that the securities: (1) are sold to \npurchasers with a substantive pre-existing relationship with individuals affiliated with the \ncompany, including controlling investors; (2) involve 35 or fewer purchasers; (3) do not exceed \nmore than $500,000, annually; and (4) do not involve a person who has violated the securities \nlaws.  These criteria do not negate the need for consumer protections embedded in current \nregulations. \n \nThis legislation would create yet another unnecessary and unwarranted exemption from the \nSecurities Act of 1933 to enable the sale of microcap offerings (those involving sales of \nsecurities valued at $500,000 or less in a single year) without appropriate regulatory protections.  \nWhile the legislation would limit the total number of investors in such offerings, it lacks a \nrequirement that those investors have the financial sophistication to understand potential risks of \nthe offering or the financial means to withstand losses.  It requires only that they have a \"pre-\nexisting relationship\" with an officer, director, or major shareholder of the issuer, a condition that \nprovides no meaningful protections.    \nFinally, H.R. 4852 (Title III) runs counter to SEC efforts to enhance disclosure requirements, \nlimiting the SEC's ability to finalize previously proposed investor protections, and would weaken \nother key consumer protections and provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act.  Additionally, H.R. 4852 bars the SEC from taking appropriate actions \nto provide needed oversight of the financial markets, encourages widespread non-compliance \nwith existing SEC filing requirements, and undermines the SEC's informed policymaking.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2357, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  November 17, 2016 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 3110 \u2013 American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016  \n(Sen. Cassidy, R-LA, and five cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes S. 3110, the American Energy and Conservation Act.  The \nbill would, among other things, change existing revenue sharing laws to increase the amount that \ncertain States and counties would receive from energy production on Federal lands and waters, \nthereby reducing the fair return on the development of these minerals to taxpayers across the \ncountry for their shared resources.  S. 3110 would have significant and long-term costs to the \nFederal Treasury. \n   \nThe Department of the Interior, which oversees the development of about 23 percent of domestic \nenergy supplies collects, on average, over $10 billion annually from the development of Federal \nminerals, including fossil and renewable energy resources.  Various statutes govern how these \nrevenues are allocated depending on the resource type and location.  About half of the Federal \nrevenue from onshore energy development is shared with States or counties, with the remainder \ndeposited in the Treasury, where it offsets annual appropriations or otherwise contributes to \ndeficit reduction.  The majority of revenue generated from offshore energy leases on the Federal \nOuter Continental Shelf (OCS) goes to the Treasury, while a portion goes to fund important \nFederal conservation programs through contributions to the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nand the Historic Preservation Fund.  Through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 \n(GOMESA), the amount of OCS revenue allocated to revenue sharing payments to nearby States \nand counties is already set to increase dramatically in fiscal year 2018. \n \nThe Administration takes seriously its responsibility to the public for the stewardship of the \nNation's energy resources and public assets that generate royalty revenue from Federal leases.  It \nremains committed to ensuring that American taxpayers receive a fair return from the sale of \npublic resources owned by all Americans.  That is why the President's 2017 Budget proposes to \nredirect future GOMESA revenue sharing payments to the dual objectives of reducing the deficit \nand enhancing the resilience of coastal communities nationwide to the impacts of climate \nchange.  In contrast, the provisions of S. 3110 would ultimately reduce the fair return on the \ndevelopment of these minerals to taxpayers across the country for their shared resources, would \nresult in reductions of billions of dollars in deposits to the Treasury, and would add significantly \nto the Federal deficit.

The American commercial launch industry is the most competitive in the world.  Over \nthe past several years, the industry has rapidly increased its share of the global market for \nsending satellites and other payloads into space.  The Administration agrees with the goal of \nH.R. 2262 to bring more stability and certainty to this growing market.  While the \nAdministration does not oppose House passage of the bill, it has serious concerns with certain \nprovisions of the bill.    \n \nFor example, the Administration believes that the \u201clearning period\u201d restricting Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) regulation of spacecraft should be extended for a shorter period than the \nten-year extension through 2025 included in the bill.  Over the next few years, several American \ncompanies are expected to bring commercial orbital and sub-orbital vehicles into service.  A \nsafety framework that relies on performance-based regulations which could be satisfied by \nvoluntary industry consensus standards would provide for a flexible approach that enhances the \noverall safety of the industry.  FAA rulemaking activity prior to 2025 may promote, rather than \nhinder, the development of the commercial spaceflight industry, depending on the pace at which \nthe market for private spaceflight services grows.  \n \nWith respect to space resource utilization, the Administration recognizes that steps have been \ntaken to ensure that the bill itself is consistent with the United States' international obligations. \nWhile the Administration strongly supports the bill's efforts to facilitate innovative new space \nactivities by U.S. companies, such as the commercial exploration and utilization of space \nresources to meet national needs, the Administration is concerned about the ability of U.S. \ncompanies to move forward with these initiatives absent additional authority to ensure \ncontinuing supervision of these initiatives by the U.S. Government as required by the Outer \nSpace Treaty. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns as the bill moves through the legislative process. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n) \n  May 23, 2016 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 897 - Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2015 \n(Rep.

Rebranding legislation that removes important Clean \nWater Act protections for public health and water quality is not an appropriate avenue for \naddressing the serious threat to the Nation that the Zika virus poses.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n        February 2, 2015 \n (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 596 \u2013 Repealing the Affordable Care Act \n(Rep. Byrne, R-AL, and 48 cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 596.  The House has now attempted \nto repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times.  H.R. 596 would take away \ncritical benefits and health care coverage from hard-working middle class families.  In addition \nto taking away Americans' health care security, the bill would increase the deficit, remove\npolicies that have helped slow health care cost growth and improve the quality of care patients \nreceive, and detract from the work the Congress could be doing to further job creation and \neconomic growth. \nThe Affordable Care Act is not only working, it is fully integrated into an improved American \nhealth care system.  Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is a thing of the past.  And \nunder the Affordable Care Act, we've seen the slowest growth in health care prices in nearly 50\nyears, benefiting all Americans. \nRepealing the Affordable Care Act would mean that Health Insurance Marketplaces where \nmillions of Americans now compare private insurance plans and get tax credits to purchase them \nwould shut down.  Tax credits for small business owners who cover their employees would be \ntaken away.  States would lose substantial Federal assistance under Medicaid to provide \ncoverage for the neediest Americans.  According to the most recent projections by the \nCongressional Budget Office (CBO), 27 million Americans are expected to gain coverage due to \nthe law.  Repeal will likely result in most of these individuals remaining uninsured or losing their \ninsurance altogether.  An estimated 10 million Americans gained coverage during 2014, and \nrepealing the law would erase most of these coverage gains and strip these Americans of the \nsecurity and peace of mind they now have.   \nFurther, repealing the health care law would have implications far beyond Americans who have \nor will gain insurance. \nMore than 250 million Americans with insurance \u2013 private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid \u2013 \nwould lose the benefits and protections they receive under the health care law.  Insurance \ncompanies would no longer have to cover as dependents millions of young adults who have been \nable to stay on or sign up on their parents' plans.  Lifetime limits and restrictive annual limits on \ncoverage could be reimposed.  Women could be charged more than men and up to 129 million \nAmericans with pre-existing conditions would be at risk of not being able to access or afford\nhealth coverage.  Policies that promote efficiency and accountability in health care and health \ninsurance would be erased. \nReforms that strengthen Medicare's long-term finances also would be repealed.  Seniors also \nwould lose the more generous prescription drug coverage provided under the health care law, as \nwell as free preventive care, and Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would become  insolvent years earlier.  Moreover, by repealing these reforms to Medicare and other reforms that \nencourage doctors and hospitals to provide efficient, high-quality care, the legislation would \ndrive up costs and worsen patient care throughout our health care system. \nCBO has previously estimated that repealing the health care law would add more than \n$100 billion to the deficit over the ten years ending in 2022, and more than $1 trillion in the \nfollowing decade.  This not only hurts the Government: it hurts State and local economies, \njob creation, and the Nation's long-term prosperity.\nThe last thing the Congress should do is refight old political battles and take a massive step \nbackward by repealing basic protections that provide security for the middle class.

Davis, R-IL, and 118 cosponsors) \n \nWhile the Administration is encouraged by the bipartisan effort in the House to advance a \nsurface transportation bill, the current bill has significant shortcomings.  H.R. 22 maintains \nfunding at current levels, which are widely acknowledged to be below the level needed to \nmaintain this country's surface transportation infrastructure, let alone improve it.  Indeed, as the \nNation's population rises and our existing infrastructure ages, funding at baseline levels as \nproposed in H.R. 22 will guarantee that roadway conditions and congestion worsen in the years \nahead.  As the President has said repeatedly, in today's economy, to compete we must have a \nfirst-class transportation system that attracts first-class jobs and takes American businesses' \ngoods all across the world.  The Congress should be thinking big, not locking in a worsening \nsystem.   \n \nThe Administration is particularly concerned that H.R. 22 would cut by 80% funding for the \nTIFIA loan program, among the Federal Government's most important transportation financing \ntools.  TIFIA has supported many of the Nation's largest and most innovative public-private \npartnerships and enjoys immense support among local and State governments. Through TIFIA, \nFederal dollars are leveraged ten to one, providing a strong return on investment.  \n \nIn addition to inadequate funding levels, the Administration has a number of other specific \nconcerns.  H.R. 22 contains several objectionable provisions that would undermine the safety of \nthe Nation's transportation system.  These include: requirements mandating that the Department \nof Transportation (DOT) stop publishing critical safety data about trucks and buses; prohibitions \non the performance of safety inspections of operating passenger motor coaches; and new \nobstacles to implementing DOT's recent rule on pneumatic brake system technology that would \nprevent accidents involving rail tank cars transporting flammable liquids.   \n \nOn permitting reform, while the Administration shares the commitment in the bill to expediting \nproject delivery and appreciates the inclusion of many Administration proposals, some \nprovisions, such as those encouraging further delegation of Federal authorities to States, could \ncreate inconsistency across the country and inefficiency in implementation. H.R. 22 also includes \ntwo provisions that would modify the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's regulatory \nprocess. First, it may force the agency into negotiated rulemakings in certain circumstances; \nnegotiated rulemakings have proven costly and inefficient, and the Administration opposes this \nchange. Second, it would require periodic review of agencies' regulations, but the Administration \nhas already established an effective retrospective review process without legislation.   \n \nThe Administration also reiterates the critical importance of making the investments necessary to \nmodernize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and ensure it continues to support U.S. energy  security.  In keeping with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, SPR sales authorized to generate \nrevenues for surface transportation funding should be carried out in a way that is fully consistent \nwith the Department of Energy's ability to invest in the SPR and the President's authority to fully \nutilize the SPR. \n \nIn contrast to the inadequate funding levels and concerning provisions in H.R. 22, the GROW \nAMERICA Act would provide robust funding for all modes of surface transportation, shortening \ncommute times and expediting travel for families and freight.  The GROW AMERICA Act \nwould also streamline project approval processes, implement innovative transportation policies \nto make better use of taxpayer dollars, and codify and expand the extraordinarily popular TIGER \nprogram.  The Administration's proposal is fully paid for in each of the six years authorized in \nthe Act through existing revenues and by reforming the international business tax system to help \ncreate jobs and spur investment while eliminating loopholes that reward companies for moving \nprofits overseas. \n \nNotwithstanding the concerns above, the Administration strongly supports the provisions \nreauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, or \"EXIM,\" which is a critical tool in the bipartisan trade \nagenda that helps U.S. businesses succeed in global markets and grow their exports, resulting in \nmore Made-in-America exports and more well-paying jobs supported in cities and towns here in \nthe United States, rather than overseas.  With more than 80 export credit agencies worldwide, \nEXIM ensures that American businesses can compete on a level playing field.  Despite bipartisan \nsupport for reauthorization in both the House and the Senate, EXIM's full authority lapsed on \nJune 30, 2015.  This has left American businesses and American workers without access to \nimportant financing tools that help high quality and innovative American-made products \ncompete in markets all around the world.  The Senate passed a long-term EXIM reauthorization \nwith 64 Members in support and the House recently passed identical legislation that garnered \nwell over two-thirds support of the House.  In FY 2014, EXIM supported 164,000 U.S. jobs and \nsent $675 million in deficit-reducing receipts to the U.S. Treasury. However, the Administration \nstrongly opposes the addition of any amendments to the legislation that would hinder EXIM's \nability to promote U.S. businesses. \n \nThe Administration is focused every day on what can be done to expand opportunity for every \nAmerican.  For America to succeed, we need the best, safest infrastructure in the world, and the \nFederal Government needs to lead the way.  We look forward to continuing to work with the \nCongress to pass a more meaningful transportation bill and an EXIM reauthorization.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nFebruary 3, 2015 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 50 \u2013 Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act  \n(Rep. Foxx, R-NC, and four cosponsors)\nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are tailored to advance statutory \ngoals in a manner that is efficient and cost-effective, and that minimizes uncertainty.  By \nlayering on additional, burdensome judicial review and other unnecessary changes to the \nregulatory process, H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2015, \nwould introduce needless uncertainty into agency decision-making and undermine the ability of \nagencies to provide critical public health and safety protections.  Accordingly, the \nAdministration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 50. \nWhen a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and well- \nunderstood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction \nAct, and the Congressional Review Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been \nguided by executive orders issued and followed by administrations of both political \nparties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations upon a reasoned \ndetermination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, to promote \nregulatory flexibility, and to reach out to the parties affected by their rules, including State, \nTribal and local governments.   \nThe President's regulatory approach has been consistent throughout his Administration.  We \ndon't have to choose between protecting the health, welfare, and safety of Americans and \npromoting economic growth, job creation, competitiveness, and innovation \u2014 we can do both.  \nTo this end, Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased public \nparticipation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, and flexible regulatory \napproaches.  Furthermore, existing executive orders and other presidential directives ask \nagencies to ensure that they take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small \nbusinesses.  Through Executive Orders 13579 and 13610, the Administration has also taken \nimportant steps to promote systematic retrospective review of regulations by all agencies.  These \nexecutive orders also encourage independent agencies to conduct retrospective review of \nregulations.  Collectively, these requirements promote flexible, cost-effective regulation. \nH.R. 50 would create needless grounds for judicial review, unduly slowing and increasing the \ncost of the regulatory process.  Creating new requirements subject to judicial review would \nunnecessarily add to the already robust analytical and procedural requirements of the rulemaking \nprocess, and potentially lowers the flexibility of future Administrations of either party to tailor \nregulatory review procedures to changing circumstances.   \nIf H.R. 50 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the \nbill.   * * * * * * *\n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \nMarch 25, 2015 \n                              (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2 \u2013 Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act \n(Rep. Burgess, R-Texas, and 10 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2 because it would reform the flawed \nMedicare physician payment system to incentivize quality and value (a proposal called for in the \nPresident's Fiscal Year 2016 Budget), would make reforms that could help slow health care cost \ngrowth, and would extend other important programs such as health care coverage for children.   \n \nMedicare payments to physicians are determined under a formula, commonly referred to as the \n\"sustainable growth rate\" (SGR).  This formula has called for reductions in physician payment \nrates since 2002, which the Congress has overridden 17 times.  Under the SGR, physician \npayment rates would be reduced by about 21 percent on April 1, 2015.  A cut of this magnitude \ncould reduce access to physicians for Medicare beneficiaries throughout the country.  H.R. 2 \nwould replace this system with one that offers predictability and accelerates participation in \nalternative payment models that encourage quality and efficiency.  The proposal would advance \nthe Administration's goal of moving the Nation's health care delivery system toward one that \nachieves better care, smarter spending, and healthier people through the expansion of new health \ncare payment models, which could contribute to slowing long-term health care cost growth. \n \nThe Administration also supports the legislation's inclusion of a continuation of policies and \nfunding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  The President's Budget includes a \nfour-year extension of this program, which has provided meaningful health coverage to over \neight million children; extending CHIP would ensure continued, comprehensive, affordable \ncoverage for these children.  H.R. 2 also includes other important proposals in the President's \nBudget, such as an extension of the Home Visiting Program and additional funding for the \nCommunity Health Center (CHC) Fund, although the legislation includes restrictions on the use \nof the CHC Fund which would be unnecessary given Executive Order 13535.  The \nAdministration supports the legislation's provision to make permanent the Qualifying Individual \nprogram, which pays the Medicare Part B premiums for certain low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries. \n \nThe legislation would pay for costs above what is needed to hold Medicare payments to \nphysicians fixed at their current level.  The savings would come from sensible reforms, which \nare expected to cover a larger share of the bill's costs over the long run.  These include \ncost-saving changes to Medicare provider payments as well as increases in the income-related \npremium for certain high-income Medicare beneficiaries, who represent about five percent of \nthose covered by Medicare.  A similar proposal was included in the President's Budget to help \nimprove the financial stability of the Medicare program by reducing the Federal subsidy of \nMedicare costs for those who need the subsidy the least.  The bill also would, starting in 2020, \nprohibit Medicare Supplemental Insurance (Medigap) policies from covering the Part B \ndeductible (currently $147) for new beneficiaries.  This would encourage more efficient health  care choices, lowering Medicare costs and Medigap premiums. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n) \n  July 8, 2015 \n(House) \n \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2647 \u2013 Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015 \n(Rep. Westerman, R-AR, and 13 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2647.  The most important step Congress can take to \nincrease the pace and scale of forest restoration and management of the national forests and \nDepartment of the Interior (DOI) lands is to fix fire suppression funding and provide additional \ncapacity for the Forest Service and DOI to manage the Nation\u2019s forests and other public lands.  \nH.R. 2647 falls short of fixing the fire budget problem and contains other provisions that will \nundermine collaborative forest restoration, environmental safeguards, and public participation \nacross the National Forest System and public lands. \n \nWildland Fire Management Funding \n \nThe Administration appreciates that there is bipartisan agreement that wildland fire management \nfunding needs a legislative fix.  The reasons are clear:  in fiscal year (FY) 1995, the Forest \nService in the Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent 16 percent of its budget on firefighting.  \nToday the agency spends more than half of its budget on fire management activities.  This \nfundamentally impedes its missions, including taking critical funding from programs that help \nreduce the risk of catastrophic fire, maintain healthy functioning ecosystems, and yield timber \nproduction. \n \nThe wildland fire funding fix in the President\u2019s FY 2016 Budget provides the necessary \nresources for the Forest Service as well as DOI to address wildland fire suppression and \nrehabilitation needs without resorting to detrimental transfers from other critical forest landscape \nresilience priorities.  Under this fix, which includes a discretionary budget cap adjustment, the \nForest Service and DOI could tap disaster funds once they spend 70 percent of their 10-year \naverage of suppression spending, which is the amount of suppression funding requested within \nthe discretionary budget caps.  Providing this certainty would preserve critical resources for \nhazardous fuel reduction and other essential landscape restoration projects, allowing for more \nacres to be treated, and thereby reducing the risk of fire, and the degree of fire destruction.  \n \nThe Administration\u2019s proposal would immediately increase the Forest Service\u2019s capacity to plan \nand execute restoration projects -- including the FY 2016 Budget projection for timber volume \nsold from 2.9 billion board feet in FY 2014 to 3.2 billion board feet.   \n \nIn contrast, the requirement in H.R. 2647 to fully fund the ten-year average for wildland fire \nsuppression would mean that less funding is available each year in the agencies\u2019 budgets for \nrestoration and risk reduction programs as it is diverted to the ever-increasing ten-year average.   \n  Additionally, the bill repurposes the Stafford Act.  The purpose of the Stafford Act is to provide \nFederal assistance to State, local, and tribal governments to alleviate disaster suffering and \nfacilitate recovery.  This bill would instead establish a sub-account within the Department of \nHomeland Security\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) to \nprovide funding for USDA and DOI to perform wildland fire suppression operations on Federal \nland when suppression funding is exhausted and the President has issued a disaster declaration \nfor such fires.  A proposed sub-account under the DRF should not be used to redirect DRF \nresources in support of non-Stafford responsibilities or to circumvent existing major disaster \ndeclarations processes \n \nUndermining Fundamental Environmental Safeguards \n \nThe Administration takes seriously the management of Federal lands consistent with the \nprinciples of multiple-use and sustained-yield that are fundamental to the National Forest \nManagement Act and the Federal Land Management and Policy Act and in accordance with \nlong-standing environmental laws including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the \nClean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, among others.  Application of these \nenvironmental laws ensures that management activities recognize the economic benefits of \nFederal lands and the wide range of goods and services that these lands produce. \n \nAt the President\u2019s direction, Federal agencies, like the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement, are working diligently to promote efficiencies in the permitting and land \nmanagement process.  For example, the Forest Service has established additional categorical \nexclusions for restoration work, has expanded the use of focused environmental assessments, is \nusing adaptive management to allow decisions to last longer, and is better training employees to \ntake advantage of new efficiencies.  The Forest Service is also developing new approaches in the \nwake of catastrophic fires, such as the response to the Rim Fire, which burned 257,000 acres in \nthe summer of 2013, in which the Stanislaus National Forest finalized its NEPA work for \nrestoration and salvage in one year.  The Forest Service is also developing projects across larger \nareas, thereby utilizing efficiencies and providing a longer term and more certain timber supply \nfor local mills.  For example, the Black Hills National Forest is implementing a landscape scale \napproach across 200,000 acres for treating current and future pine beetle outbreaks.  \n \nHR 2647 includes several provisions that will undermine collaborative, landscape-scale forest \nrestoration by undermining public trust in forest management projects and by limiting public \nparticipation in decision-making.  The Administration has substantial concerns with the design \nand scale of the categorical exclusions, provisions related to post-fire salvage and restoration \n(including unrealistic timelines for environmental assessments), and unrealistic targets for \nreforestation given current budgetary resources.   \n \nThe Administration has serious concerns with provisions in the bill related to the Resources \nAdvisory Committees (RACs). The Administration opposes provisions that limit the discretion \nof RACs by requiring 50 percent of Secure Rural Schools Act Title II funding be spent on timber \nmanagement projects.  H.R. 2647 also assumes RACs can fulfill the role of local forest \ncollaboratives in designing forest restoration projects, though the RACs were not specially set up \ndo this and in many cases may not have the breadth of stakeholder interest and expertise to do so \neffectively.  Additionally, the Administration opposes restrictions in the bill on the membership \nof RACs. \n \n2  Furthermore, the Administration opposes provisions in the bill that require litigants to post a \nbond when challenging forest restoration projects.  As the Forest Service has demonstrated, the \nbest way to address concerns about litigation is to develop restoration projects in partnership \nwith broad stakeholder interests through a transparent process informed by the best available \nscience.  Lastly, the bill should include stronger protections for ecologically sensitive areas, \ntribal sacred sites, and other important lands.   \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2647.  The \nAdministration looks forward to continued engagement with Congress to address forest \nmanagement issues, which must begin by providing the Forest Service and DOI with a \ncomprehensive fix to the fire budget problem.  \n  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nNovember 19, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1900 \u2013 Natural Gas Pipeline Permitting Reform Act \n(Rep.

The funding provided will help \npromote job-creating business investment in the United States and ensure a level playing field for \nU.S. businesses overseas.   \n \nPeriodic Censuses and Programs.  The Administration is deeply concerned that the bill does not \nprovide adequate funding for the Census Bureau to produce robust economic and demographic \ndata, or sufficiently prepare for the 2020 Decennial Census.

The Administration strongly objects to sections 528 and \n529, which would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and \nfor the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guant\u00e1namo detainees \nin the United States.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar \nprovisions in prior legislation and has reiterated his call to the Congress to lift the restrictions.  \nAs the President said in his State of the Union Address, \"this needs to be the year Congress lifts \nthe remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\"  \nOperating the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo weakens our national security by draining \nresources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent \nextremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive \nBranch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to \ndetermine when and where to prosecute Guant\u00e1namo detainees based on the facts and \ncircumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Section 528 would, moreover, \nviolate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances.  \n \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) Gun Riders.  The Administration \nstrongly opposes language in the bill that severely inhibits ATF's ability to combat illegal gun \ntrafficking and protect the public.  This includes the requirement that ATF authorize the \nimportation of certain \"curio and relic\" firearms simply because of their age and regardless of the \ndanger they may pose; and the prohibition against ATF denying an application to import \nparticular models or configurations of a shotgun that do not meet the statutory \"sporting \npurposes\" test.  In addition, the Administration urges the Congress to repeal a number of \nprovisions made permanent in prior years, including a prohibition against requiring firearms \ndealers to conduct physical inventories and a prohibition on changing the definition of \"curio and \nrelic\" firearms. \n \nExecutive Office of the President   \n \nOffice of the U.S Trade Representative (USTR).  The Administration appreciates the $2.4 million \nincrease over the FY 2014 enacted level, but urges the Congress to provide the FY 2015 Budget \nrequest of $56.2 million for USTR.  The $1.2 million reduction would limit USTR's ability to \nconduct major trade negotiations, enforce trade agreements, and pursue new and existing trade \ndisputes.   \n \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  \n \nCommercial Crew Program.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the \nCommercial Crew program, but has concerns about language that would seek to apply \naccounting requirements unsuitable for a firm, fixed-price acquisition, likely increasing the \nprogram's cost and potentially delaying its schedule.   \n \nSpace Technology Program.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not provide the \nFY 2015 Budget request for the Space Technology program.  Space Technology is needed to \nreduce the cost and increase the long-term capability of NASA, other Government, and \ncommercial space activities.   \n \nFuture Science Missions.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for science \nmissions, but is concerned about prematurely specifying elements of future missions while the \n3  missions are in a very early state of development.  In particular, the Administration believes the \nCommittee's proposed approach to a follow-on Landsat mission is not feasible within the bill's \nproposed cost cap of $650 million, and that it is premature to designate the Space Launch System \nas the launch vehicle for a Europa mission before the costs and benefits of such a choice are \nunderstood.  \n \nNational Science Foundation (NSF) \n \nThe Administration supports the Committee's funding of NSF's top line at the requested level of \n$7.3 billion.  NSF invests in important research and education and lays the foundation for \neconomic growth.   \n \nLegal Services Corporation (LSC) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee's support for LSC, but urges the Congress to fully \nfund the FY 2015 Budget request of $430 million.  At the lower funding level, thousands of low- \nincome Americans, including many military families and veterans, would be denied assistance \nwith civil legal problems, impacting their ability to receive fair treatment in the courts.  \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nOther provisions in the bill, including sections 509, 519, and 527, would also raise constitutional \nconcerns in certain applications by intruding upon the President's constitutional authority over \ninternational diplomacy.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to \naddress these concerns.   \n \nDivision 2 \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \n \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) \n \nSurface Transportation Funding.  The Administration looks forward to working with the \nCongress to enact the GROW AMERICA Act proposal.  This legislative proposal would provide \n$302 billion over four years for highways, transit, highway safety, and rail program, as well as for \nTransportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grants, and is paid for by \npro-growth business tax reforms.  While the bill maintains current levels of funding for vital \ntransportation programs, necessary improvements to the Nation's transportation network cannot \nbe made by freezing obligation limitations for highway, transit, and highway safety at the FY \n2014 authorized levels.  A robust, multi-year authorization is essential to providing States and \nmunicipalities with the long-term funding to make investments in transportation improvements \nthat grow the economy and serve U.S. citizens.  \n \nNational Infrastructure Investments.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's funding of \nTIGER grants at a level that would continue to support innovative projects across the Nation.  \nThe bill clearly demonstrates the Committee's commitment to continuing transformative \nmultimodal projects around the Nation.  \n \nSafe Transport of Energy Products.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's targeted \nfunding increases for the Federal Railroad Administration, which would lead to improvements in \n4  the safety of crude oil transport by rail.  Specifically, the bill provides increases designed to \nbolster the oversight of railroads' adherence to Federal safety standards, enhance the quality of \ninformation on accident risk, and improve training and coordination among agencies, railroads, \nand emergency responders.  For the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the \nAdministration appreciates that the Committee provides the requested funding level of $52 \nmillion for the Hazardous Materials Safety account.  It is a step toward funding the additional \nresearch, training, and outreach associated with the recent surge in oil and natural gas \ntransportation.  \n \nFederal Transit Administration Capital Investment (New Starts) Grants.  The Administration \nappreciates the Committee's strong support for New Starts.  By continuing to fund projects \nincluding the building of new fixed guideway systems or extensions and improvements to \nexisting fixed guideway systems, the Committee is helping meet Americans' demand for transit, \nand investing in systems which help move an increasing number of people to home or work \nsafely.  \n \nInfrastructure Permitting Center.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee did not \nprovide the requested funding level for the interagency permitting center, which is essential to \nmodernizing and streamlining the Federal permitting and review process, reducing the time it \ntakes to start infrastructure projects while improving outcomes for the environment.  The funding \nrequested in the FY 2015 Budget supports key reforms in the Administration's comprehensive \nplan announced by the President last month.  The plan includes 15 reforms and nearly 100 \nactions to significantly improve Federal permitting to accelerate economic growth, expand \nopportunity, and improve the competitiveness of the American economy.  Expanding and \ninstitutionalizing permitting reform Government-wide to build a 21st Century infrastructure is \nalso a critical component of the President's Management Agenda, aimed at improving the \nefficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government.  \n \nMotor Carrier Safety.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that would \nsuspend the enforcement of specific provisions in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration's hours of service rule.  Specifically, the amendment to the bill would suspend the \nenforcement of the rule's \"restart\" provision, effectively boosting the number of hours a truck \ndriver could work from the 70 hour maximum average on the books today, to 82 hours a week.  \nThe current hours of service rules have been sought by the National Transportation Safety Board \nfor many years and are now serving to prevent an additional estimated 1,400 crashes, 560 \ninjuries, and save 19 lives a year by reducing the risk of fatigue related crashes, as fatigue \nremains a lead factor in the 300,000 crashes that occur each year.  The Administration also \nopposes provisions that change existing truck safety rules including restrictions on the \nmodification of insurance requirements and the permissible size and weight of trucks operating \non Federal highways.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st \nCentury Act (MAP-21), the Department of Transportation is currently conducting a \ncomprehensive truck size and weight limits study.  Any reconsideration of size and weight limits \nshould be done on a comprehensive basis with full consideration of the infrastructure and safety \nimpacts as informed by the MAP-21 study. \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nHousing Choice Vouchers.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the \n5  Housing Choice Voucher program administrative fees, which will ensure that Public Housing \nAuthorities can ensure that units are safe and habitable.  However, the Administration is deeply \nconcerned about the funding level provided for the Vouchers program.  The amount in the bill is \ninsufficient to provide the same level of assistance to families as in 2014 and would not restore \nthe funding reduction from sequestration.   \n \nHomeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration strongly opposes the funding level provided in \nthe bill for Homeless Assistance Grants, which is $261 million below the FY 2015 Budget \nrequest, and would not allow for the development of new permanent supportive housing as part \nof the Administration's efforts to end chronic homelessness in 2016.   \n \nChoice Neighborhoods.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for Choice \nNeighborhoods, and urges the Congress to fully fund the program at the FY 2015 Budget request \nlevel of $120 million.  Choice Neighborhoods provides critical support to revitalize distressed \nHUD-assisted housing and build ladders of opportunity for low-income families by improving \neconomic development, creating jobs, and increasing access to high-quality schools and \neducation programs in surrounding communities.  \n \nRental Assistance Demonstration (RAD).  The Administration supports the Committee's funding \nlevel for RAD, including its expansion to 185,000 units.  RAD preserves critically needed Public \nHousing by converting it to long-term Section 8 contracts that can leverage private financing for \ncapital improvements.  \n \nHOME Investment Partnerships Program.  The Administration strongly supports the \nCommittee's funding level for the HOME program, which is funded at the FY 2015 Budget \nrequest.  This program is critical for increasing the supply of affordable housing for low-income \nfamilies.  \n \nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) Administrative Expense.  The Administration appreciates \nthe Committee's support for enhanced management by FHA and encourages the Congress to \nprovide the full $170 million request for this activity.  The Administration also appreciates the \nCommittee's inclusion of new fee authority that would provide offsetting collections credited \nagainst FHA administrative spending.  FHA insures a portfolio of over $1 trillion in mortgages \nand increased resources would improve risk management and limit claim costs.  \n \nHousing Counseling.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for Housing \nCounseling and encourages the Congress to provide the full $60 million request for this activity.  \nThe requested funding level in the FY 2015 Budget would help a large number of low-income \nhouseholds navigate a dynamic housing market to achieve sustainable homeownership, avoid \nhomelessness, or find quality affordable rental housing.  \n \nDivision 3 \u2013 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \nAgencies \n \nU.S. Department of Agriculture \n \nChild Nutrition.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support for science-\nbased nutrition standards for children.  School nutrition standards are developed by independent \n6  experts, over 90 percent of schools report that they are successfully implementing them, and \nstudies show they are working to help improve children's health.  The Administration strongly \nopposes the inclusion of any language in the bill that would override science-based standards that \nimprove child nutrition.  \nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Food Package. \n The Administration understands that the objective of the language in the bill that would require \nthe inclusion of white potatoes in the WIC food package, pending further scientific review, is \nintended to preserve the science-based review process used to determine which foods should be \nincluded in the WIC food package.  The Administration strongly opposes the inclusion of any \nlanguage in the bill that would override science-based standards that improve child nutrition.  \nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).  The \nAdministration appreciates that the Committee provides sufficient funding to serve all projected \nWIC participants for FY 2015.  The Administration also supports the bill's provision of $150 \nmillion in contingency funds to ensure that the program has sufficient resources to meet \nunexpected changes in participation.    \n \nChild Nutrition School Equipment Grants.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \ncontinued support of school meals equipment grants, but urges the Congress to fully fund the \nFY 2015 Budget request of $35 million to help school districts purchase the equipment needed to \nserve healthier meals, improve food safety, expand access to meals, and improve energy \nefficiency.  \n \nHealthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI).  The Administration is concerned that the Committee \ndid not provide the requested $13 million for the HFFI program, which was authorized in the \nmost recent Farm Bill.  This program would be used to support increased access to healthy foods \nin underserved areas, create and preserve quality jobs, and to revitalize low-income communities.  \n \nFood Aid Reform.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for P.L. 480 Title II food aid \nand retention of the reforms passed in FY 2014, but is concerned that the bill excludes proposed \nfood aid reforms that would help two million more people in crises without additional resources. \n At a time when major food crises are increasing, including those in South Sudan and Syria, the \nproposed reforms to allow more cost-effective, flexible emergency food aid are critical.  \n \nNational Institute of Food and Agriculture.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee \nincluded no funding to support the three research innovation institutes, as requested in the \nFY 2015 Budget, and recommended by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and \nTechnology.  These institutes would provide competitive grants to support public-private \ncooperation for pollinator health research, bio-based advanced manufacturing, and anti-microbial \nresistance, all of which are important issues facing the Nation.    \n \nFarm Service Agency (FSA).  The Administration is disappointed by the bill language that \nprohibits closure of FSA county offices.  The Administration is also disappointed that the \nCommittee has reduced the FY 2015 Budget request by $33 million for the MIDAS information \ntechnology initiative as it is a critical part of FSA's modernization process. \n \nRental Assistance Grant Program.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully \nfunds Rental Assistance Grants at $1.1 billion.  The Administration encourages the Congress to \n7  adopt the funding flexibilities proposed in the FY 2015 Budget in order to improve the \nmanagement and efficiency of the program.  \n \nSummer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Demonstration.  The Administration urges the \nCongress to fund summer EBT pilots, consistent with the FY 2015 Budget request.  These pilots \nare proving successful in reducing childhood hunger and improving nutrition in the months when \nschool meals are unavailable.    \n \nDepartment of Health and Human Services \u2013 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n \nUser Fees.  The Administration appreciates the Committee mark for FDA, but continues to \nsupport new proposed user fees that would provide vital resources to enhance FDA's capacity to \nsupport a prevention-based food safety system.  The Congress is urged to enact these user fees as \nproposed in the FY 2015 Budget request.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n8  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nNovember 18, 2013 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 1197 - National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2014 \n(Sen. Levin, D-MI) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee's continued support of \nour national defense in S. 1197, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.  In \nparticular, the Administration appreciates the support of the Committee for authorities that assist \nthe Armed Forces in operating in unconventional and irregular warfare and countering \nunconventional threats, support capacity building efforts with foreign military forces, and \nsupport contingency or stability operations, as well as its support for the one percent pay raise for \nmembers of the uniformed services.  The Administration also commends the Committee for \nworking to offer stronger protections for sexual assault victims. \n \nWhile there are a number of areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration has \nserious concerns with certain provisions.  Several provisions would constrain the ability of the \nArmed Forces to align military capabilities and force structure with the President's strategy, \nimpede the ability of the Secretary of Defense to reduce overhead and make programs more \nefficient, and constrain efforts to implement the U.S. strategy for Afghanistan.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, \na number of which are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks forward to \nreviewing a classified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns on \nclassified programs. \n \nDetainee Matters:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's constructive proposals \nregarding transfers of detainees held at the U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  The \nCommittee's provisions are a significant improvement over existing law.  Of course, even in the \nabsence of any statutory restrictions, the Administration would transfer a detainee only if any \nthreat the detainee poses can be sufficiently mitigated and only when consistent with our humane \ntreatment policy.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress on \nrefining these provisions to ensure that they provide necessary flexibility to the Executive \nBranch. \n \nTRICARE Fees and Co-Payments:  The Administration believes that military retirees deserve \nquality, sustainable health care benefits.  For this reason, the Administration strongly supports its \nrequested TRICARE fee initiative that seeks to control the growth of health care costs at the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) while keeping retired beneficiaries' share of these costs well \nbelow the levels experienced when the TRICARE program was implemented in the mid-\n1990s.  The projected FY 2014 TRICARE savings of $902 million and $9.3 billion through FY \n2018 are essential for DOD to successfully address rising personnel costs.  DOD needs these \nsavings to balance and maintain investments for key defense priorities, especially amidst \nsignificant fiscal challenges posed by statutory spending caps.  The Administration strongly \nurges the Congress to support the proposed TRICARE fee initiative.   \nBase Realignment and Closure (BRAC):  The Administration strongly objects to section 2702, \nwhich would make a formal review of the overseas military facility infrastructure a precondition \nfor authorizing any future BRAC round.  The Administration has been reviewing DOD's \noverseas infrastructure, and the results of that analysis will inform future infrastructure \ndecisions.  However, the effort to configure our overseas infrastructure in a more efficient way \nshould not prevent the authorization of another round of BRAC analysis for domestic bases.  The \nAdministration urges the Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which \nwould allow DOD to right size its infrastructure, while providing important assistance to affected \ncommunities.  Without authorization for a new round of BRAC, DOD may not properly align the \nmilitary's infrastructure with the needs of the evolving force structure, which is critical to \nensuring that limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the Armed Forces and \nnational security. \n \nLife Extension Program:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1043, which would \nrequire DOD and the National Nuclear Security Administration to develop cost estimates for \nfour separate life extension program (LEP) options as part of the W78/88-1 Phase 6.2/6.2A \nFeasibility and Cost Study.  The current study scope will inform a cost/risk/benefit decision on a \nwarhead with an interoperable nuclear explosive package that can be used on multiple \nplatforms.  Including efforts to determine feasibility and costs for full scope LEPS on the W78, \nW88, and W87, and W78/88-1 would significantly delay completion and increase costs of the \nfeasibility study.  \n \nResearch & Development Funding Reductions:  The Administration objects to the $100 million \nreduction for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the $100 million \nreduction to the Navy's Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW) weapon \ndevelopment.  DARPA's innovative research leads to breakthrough discoveries and helps \nmaintain the technological superiority of the U.S. military.  Full funding for DARPA is \nimportant to adequately support ongoing programs and initiate new research activities.  The \nOASuW development effort is necessary for rebalancing the Department's mix of force structure \nand program investments towards the Asia-Pacific theater of operations, and is essential to \nsupporting future operations against heavily defended targets in anti-access/area-denied \nenvironments.  The OASuW's development is aligned with Combatant Commander priorities and \nleverages existing DARPA investments to enable delivery of required capabilities in the most \nexpeditious and economical manner at the lowest risk. \n \nRetention of Navy Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) \nPlatforms:  The Administration strongly objects to section 124(b)(2), which would require the \nNavy to maintain the current number of EP-3 aircraft allocated under the Global Force \nManagement Allocation Plan.  The Department is executing a Joint Requirements Oversight \nCouncil-approved Maritime ISR and Targeting Transition Plan, which would maintain the ISR \ncapability resident in the legacy force (EP-3/SPA) and develop the future force (P-8 QRC/MQ-\n4C Triton/Triton Multi-INT) to provide Combatant Commands with a scalable, interoperable, \nand persistent ISR capability. \n \nMilitary Construction Projects Funded Using In-Kind Payments:  The Administration strongly \nobjects to section 2801, which would require that military construction projects funded by in-\nkind payments from partner nations be submitted for congressional authorization in the annual \nNational Defense Authorization Act.  Construction projects provided pursuant to bilateral \nagreements with host countries or as in-kind payment of residual value are accomplished by \n2  sovereign partner nations.  This proposed change in law would result in host nations awaiting \nactions by the U.S. Congress before they would spend their funds for projects to be constructed \nin their countries.  At the very least, our partner nations would regard this process unnecessarily \nburdensome and interfering in their domestic defense decisions.  This requirement could have a \nnegative effect on our ability to secure significant cost-sharing support. \n \nRealignment of Marines Corps Forces in Asia-Pacific Region:  The Administration strongly \nobjects to the limitations imposed by section 2821 on the obligation of funds for the realignment \nof U.S. Marine Corps units from Okinawa to Guam and Hawaii, a goal to which successive \nAdministrations have remained steadfastly committed since 2006.  A key aspect of the Asia-\nPacific rebalance is to create a more operationally resilient Marine Corps presence in the Pacific \nand invest in Guam as a joint strategic hub.  By preventing the timely obligation of United States \nand Government of Japan funds to implement this realignment, section 2821 would \nunnecessarily restrict the ability and flexibility of the President to execute our foreign and \ndefense policies in coordination with our ally, Japan, and undermines a key component of the \nbroader U.S. strategy in the Asia-Pacific region.  Further, the Administration has serious \nconcerns regarding the section 2821 restrictions on the development of public infrastructure on \nGuam, and the lack of authorization for a military construction project (aircraft hangar) that \nwould directly support the realignment.  These actions would raise questions among regional \nstates about the reliability of the United States security commitments to allies in the region. \n \nStreamlining DOD Management Headquarters:  While the Administration recognizes that there \nare opportunities for streamlining and reducing duplication in headquarters staffs, we object to \nsection 905 to develop a plan with particular budgetary or fiscal targets, which would preclude \nthe Department from appropriately sizing its workforce to meet its mission workload.  The \nSecretary of Defense has already issued similar guidance and the Department is planning for a 20 \npercent reduction in headquarters, including restructuring and streamlining DOD headquarters in \nthe Services, the Joint Staff, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. \n \nLimitation on the Availability of Funds for the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations \n(TFBSO):  The Administration objects to subsection (c) of section 1533, which requires the \nGovernment of Afghanistan to agree to use future oil and mineral royalties to reimburse the \nUnited States for TFBSO-funded economic assistance.  It is not the policy of the U.S. \nGovernment to seek reimbursement for economic assistance programs.  In addition to \ncontradicting long-standing precedent, this provision could harm U.S.-led efforts to build a \nsustainable Afghan economy and secure a long-term revenue source for the Afghan central \ngovernment. \n \nIraqi and Afghan Special Immigrant Visas (SIV):  The Administration appreciates the inclusion \nof sections 1217 and 1218, relating to authority for SIVs for certain Iraqi and Afghan \nnationals.  The Administration supports extension of these programs, but notes its concern with \nthe broadening of the class of aliens who would be eligible, and considers the periods of \nextension provided for under sections 1217 and 1218 insufficient to meet projected program \ndemand for either Iraq or Afghanistan.  We look forward to working with the Congress on these \nand other appropriate modifications to sections 1217 and 1218 to ensure Iraqi and Afghan \nnationals who have aided U.S. efforts in these countries through their work, and who have \nexperienced or are experiencing an ongoing serious threat as a result, are able to apply for these \nvisas. \n \nTraining U.S. General Purpose Forces with Military and Other Security Forces of Friendly \n3  Foreign Countries:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for authorizing \ntraining of general purpose forces of the U.S. Armed Forces with military and limited other \nsecurity forces of friendly foreign countries.  However, the Administration urges that section \n1203 be revised to conform to the Administration's requested purposes and authorities, including \nconcurrence of the Secretary of State, in order to ensure that the focus remains exclusively on the \nintended purpose to benefit U.S. forces and remains consistent with essential foreign policy \nconsiderations. \n \nPersonnel Security Clearances:  Given recent events, the Administration opposes section 931 as \nwe are currently conducting a comprehensive 120-day interagency Suitability and Security \nProcesses Review under the Performance Accountability Council, led by the Office of \nManagement and Budget.  The Administration recognizes the need to further strengthen the \nPersonnel Security Clearance Investigations (PSI) program, but given the scope of the Review, \nthe Administration requests that the Senate defer action and not proceed with section 931,which \ncould create a direct conflict with the existing governance structure of a single Security \nExecutive Agent.  The Administration is committed to engaging with the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and other Congressional committees on the Review's findings and recommendations \nto improve the security clearance process. \n \nSupervision of the Acquisition of Cloud Computing Capabilities for Intelligence Analysis:  The \nAdministration appreciates the inclusion of section 943, which addresses the interoperability \nbetween a DOD intelligence analysis system and the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence's (ODNI) Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC \nITE).  The Administration interprets this provision as allowing DOD to pursue cloud computing \ncapabilities for the Department and does not interpret this provision as intending to supersede the \nDNI's current efforts with respect to IC ITE.  As a matter of good governance, the ODNI and \nDOD will continue their efforts to appropriately align their respective IT systems to enable their \nrelated missions. \n \nTrans Regional Web Initiative (TRWI):  The Administration opposes section 343 because \nprohibiting the Secretary of Defense from expending any funds to continue the TRWI and the \nassociated websites would effectively remove an important Military Information Support \nOperations tool used by the Geographic Combatant Commanders in support of their missions as \ndirected in the Unified Command Plan.  TRWI is the Department's only synchronized online \ninfluence effort able to challenge the spread of extremist ideology and propaganda on the \nWeb.  Earlier this year, the Department, pursuant to congressional certification requirements in \nsection 1535 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, addressed many of \nthe concerns raised in the Committee report by demonstrating that the TRWI is the most cost-\neffective means for reaching audiences which affect achievement of Geographic Combatant \nCommanders Theater Campaign Plan objectives. \n \nLimitation on Allowable Cost for Contractor Employee Compensation:  The Administration \ncommends the Senate for including section 841, which would set the cap establishing the \nreimbursement limit on compensation for contractor employees at $487,000.  Eliminating the \ncurrent statutory formula for setting the cap -- which has caused the limit to soar by more than \n300 percent from $250,000 in the mid-1990s to close to $1 million in FY 2012 - and replacing it \nwith a more reasonable baseline is an important step in restoring fiscal responsibility to federal \ncontracting and giving relief to taxpayers who have been saddled with paying excessive \ncompensation costs to contractors.  We urge the Senate to apply this reform government-wide, as \nproposed by the Administration, so that this change can be applied uniformly and consistently to \n4  all contractor employees who do business with the Federal Government, both defense and \ncivilian. \n \nLand Withdrawals:  The Administration urges the inclusion of the renewals of withdrawals for \nthe China Lake, Limestone Hills, and Chocolate Mountains ranges.  These withdrawals are \ncritical to the continued readiness of the nation's armed forces. \n \nScience, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Programs:  The Administration \nobjects to the restoration of funding for the STARBASE program, which would perpetuate the \nFederal Government's fragmented approach to STEM education, whereby more than 220 \nprograms are scattered across 13 agencies.  The Administration's proposed reorganization of \nSTEM programs would improve STEM education quality and outcomes across the Federal \nGovernment. \n \nConstitutional Concerns:  A number of the bill's provisions, such as section 1065 and 1236, raise \nadditional constitutional concerns, including interference with the President's authority as \nCommander in Chief to direct deployment and use of the armed forces and exclusive authorities \nrelated to international negotiations. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n5  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nSeptember 30, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nHouse Amendment to H.J.Res. 59 \u2013 Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014 \n(Rep.

The Senate acted \nin a responsible manner on a short-term funding measure to maintain Government functions and \navoid a damaging Government shutdown.

The bill provides \nneeded resources for the near term to the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland \nSecurity, Justice, and State to support the Administration's aggressive, unified, and coordinated \nFederal response to the urgent humanitarian situation along the Southwest border and makes \nlonger-term progress in stemming the flow of Central American migrants.  The Administration \nencourages the Congress to move forward on long-lasting solutions provided by common-sense \nimmigration reform.  Unlike the House Republican approach, this bill responsibly addresses the \nhumanitarian situation without injecting partisan provisions that are unworkable and would \nincrease costs without solving the problem.  Rather than holding necessary resources hostage to \npartisan provisions, the Administration encourages the Congress to move forward on long-lasting \nsolutions provided by common-sense immigration reform. \n \nThe bill also provides the necessary resources for the Department of Agriculture to address \nimminent wildfire suppression and rehabilitation needs without resorting to damaging transfers \nfrom other critical forest health and fire preparedness priorities.  Further, it includes the \nbipartisan proposal for a discretionary cap adjustment to provide funding certainty in the future \nfor programs in the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior that often have to transfer funds \nto wildfire suppression during active fire seasons.  \n \nThe bill provides funding to the Department of Defense to support the Government of Israel's \nrequest for critical missile defense needs.  The funding will accelerate production of Iron Dome \ncomponents in order to maintain adequate stockpiles. \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to act swiftly to pass the bill to allow a timely and \neffective response to these pressing needs.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJanuary 6, 2014 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 1845 \u2013 Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act \n(Sen.

This bipartisan legislation would restore emergency \nunemployment insurance benefits that expired for 1.3 million Americans looking for work at the \nend of 2013.  Extending these benefits would not only help these families pay their bills but it is \nalso one of the most cost effective ways to strengthen the economy, according to independent \neconomists. \n \nHistorically, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to make sure that unemployment \ninsurance continues for job-seekers during times when there are still too many Americans out of \nwork, and it is unprecedented for the Congress to allow emergency unemployment benefits to \nexpire at a time when long-term unemployment is as high as it is today.  The Congress should act \nimmediately to pass this bipartisan three-month extension, restoring a vital economic lifeline for \nhardworking American families while giving more time for consideration of further extension \nthrough 2014.

It is time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in \nan agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and security for middle class \nfamilies and all those working to get into the middle-class. \n \nThe Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care and has already \nimproved many aspects of the Nation's health care system.  Beginning in October 2013, millions \nof low- and middle-income Americans will be eligible to receive tax credits to help them \npurchase insurance and cost-sharing reductions to help with out-of-pocket expenses for coverage \neffective January 1, 2014.  Tens of millions of Americans who have previously been denied \ncoverage due to a pre-existing medical condition will now be covered.  The nearly one in two \nAmericans under the age of 65 with pre-existing medical conditions will have the peace of mind \nthat comes from knowing that they cannot be dropped from their health plan or denied coverage \nbecause of those conditions. House passage of H.R. 2775 would undermine this security by \ndelaying tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that will otherwise be provided to millions of \nAmericans. \n \nH.R. 2775 is unnecessary because the Secretary of Health and Human Services has already put in \nplace an effective and efficient system for verification of eligibility for premium tax credits and \ncost sharing reductions.  Moreover, it would create vague standards for the Inspector General, \nwhose office has never performed this type of prospective review, to \u201csuccessfully and \nconsistently\u201d verify eligibility.  As a result, this legislation\u2019s unnecessary pre-certification \nrequirement would impede opening the Marketplaces on October 1, 2013, driving up out-of-\npocket health care costs for millions of Americans and reducing timely access to much-needed \nand long-denied affordable coverage. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2775, his senior advisers would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nNovember 4, 2013 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 815 \u2013 Employment Non-Discrimination Act \n(Sen.

The bill requires State surface \ncoal mining regulatory agencies to implement the 2008 Stream Buffer Zone Rule for a mandatory \nimplementation period, which inadequately protects drinking water and watersheds from strip \nmining.  H.R. 2824 limits a State's ability to tailor stream safeguards or maintain currently \nadopted standards, creates needless regulatory and legal uncertainty, and requires States to waste \nsignificant taxpayer dollars adopting a rule that has been vacated by a Federal court. \n \nThe Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement is \ndeveloping a proposed Stream Protection Rule that provides for responsible development while \nprotecting our communities and environment.

It \nwould increase the deficit and detract from the work the Congress needs to do to focus on the economy \nand create jobs. \n \nRepealing the Affordable Care Act would mean that Health Insurance Marketplaces where Americans \ncould compare private insurance plans and get tax credits to purchase them would not open.  Tax credits \nfor small business owners who cover their employees would be eliminated.  States would lose \nsubstantial Federal assistance under Medicaid to provide coverage for the neediest Americans. \n \nBut repealing the health care law would have implications far beyond the estimated 30 million \nAmericans without insurance who would lose the health coverage they were going to receive. \n \nMore than 250 million Americans with insurance \u2013 private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid \u2013 would \nlose the benefits and protections they receive under the health care law.  Insurance companies would be \nable to go back to some of their worst practices.  They would no longer have to cover as dependents the \n6.6 million young adults who have been able to stay on or sign up on their parents' plans.  They would \nbe able to impose lifetime limits and restrictive annual limits on coverage.  They could go back to \ndenying coverage to children with preexisting conditions.  And, they would likely turn away the \napproximately 100,000 Americans who had gained insurance through the Pre-existing Condition \nInsurance Plan program, which would have to shut down immediately.  Many insurance companies \nwould no longer be held accountable for double-digit premium increases.  Strict rules that prevent \ninsurance companies from spending too much on administrative costs or CEO bonuses would be erased. \n \nReforms that strengthen Medicare's long-term finances would also be repealed.

Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on H.R. 4660, making appropriations \nfor the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes.  While the Administration appreciates the \nsupport for research and development in the bill, H.R. 4660 inadequately funds areas critical to \nthe Nation's economic growth, security, and competitiveness in the global marketplace, including \ninvestments in climate research, assistance to small manufacturers, and support for commercial \nspace flight, census research, and access to justice.  The bill also includes a number of \nobjectionable language provisions that will make it more difficult to protect the public from gun \nviolence and continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, \nCuba that will undermine our national security.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations \nprocess that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding \nunnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include \nreconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and \nnational security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an \norderly appropriations process.  \n \nThe President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to \naccelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our \nnational security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same \ntime, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to \ndeliver a government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.  \n \nThe President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan \nBudget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels\u2014including \ninvestments in research and development that will grow the economy and enable America to \nremain the world leader in innovation.  However, the levels agreed to in the BBA are already \nbelow FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation and are not sufficient\u2014either in FY 2015 or \nbeyond\u2014to ensure the Nation is achieving its full potential. For that reason, the Budget also \nincludes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative\u2014evenly split between \ndefense and non-defense priorities\u2014that presents additional investments to grow the economy, \nexpand opportunity, and enhance security.  The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative \nwould support additional research and development at the National Science Foundation, National \nInstitutes of Standards and Technology, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and \nother agencies across the government that would create the businesses and jobs of the future.   \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve these issues during the \nFY 2015 appropriations process. \n \nDepartment of Commerce \n \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee's support for the National Weather Service and critical weather satellites.  However, \nthe Administration strongly opposes the significant reductions below FY 2014 funding levels for \nhigh priority climate research, as well as the elimination of funding for the Total Solar Irradiance \nSensor that is necessary to maintain a long-term climate data record.  NOAA's climate research \nwill help the Nation better understand, monitor, and prepare for the impacts of climate change.  \nIn addition, the Administration opposes the reduction to NOAA's fisheries management and \ncoastal restoration programs, including regional coastal resilience grants. These programs \ncontribute to the long-term economic and ecosystem health of the fishing industry and coastal \ncommunities throughout the United States.  \n \nInternational Trade Administration (ITA).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the \nrequested funding level of $497 million for ITA, which would fully fund SelectUSA and the \nInteragency Trade Enforcement Center.  Reduced funding levels for these two priorities would \nundermine efforts to increase foreign investment in the United States, create jobs, and ensure a \nlevel playing field for U.S. businesses overseas. \n \nPeriodic Censuses and Programs.  The Administration objects to the inadequate funding \nprovided to the Census Bureau to produce robust economic and demographic data, or sufficiently \nprepare for the 2020 Decennial Census.  The Committee's proposed funding level would increase \ncosts by billions of dollars over the next five years by preventing the Census Bureau from \nconducting the necessary research, testing, and early implementation activities that are needed to \ncontain costs in conducting the 2020 Census.  \n \nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) Data Collection.  The Administration strongly objects to \nlanguage in the bill included in the Bureau of the Census, salaries and expenses account \nrequiring that the data collection for CPS use outdated health insurance questions included in \nprevious years.  The revised questions will allow the Census Bureau to better measure the \nuninsured, while reverting back to the previous questions will create a gap in the data and \nseverely limit its statistical value.  \n \nNational Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).  The Administration \nopposes the funding reduction from the FY 2014 enacted level and the FY 2015 Budget request \nfor NTIA.  This reduction would prevent NTIA from standing-up the Internet Policy Center to \nbolster the Administration's Internet governance and policy efforts.   \n \nNational Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The Administration is concerned that \nthe bill does not provide the requested increases to the Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nprogram to support small manufacturing businesses, or those that will enhance benefits from the \nManufacturing Institutes Initiative.  These initiatives will help advance the development and \nadoption of new manufacturing technologies. \n \n2  Department of Justice (DOJ) \n \nState and Local Assistance Programs. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support \nfor the Justice Reinvestment Initiative and the Now is the Time Comprehensive School Safety \nProgram.  However, the Administration strongly objects to the Committee's decision to reduce \nfunding from the requested levels for juvenile justice and delinquency prevention programs and \nfor Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS).  The reductions in COPS funding alone \nwould result in almost 1,000 fewer officer hires.  \n \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) Gun Riders.  The Administration \nstrongly opposes language in the bill that severely inhibits ATF's ability to combat illegal gun \ntrafficking and protect the public.  This includes the requirement that ATF authorize the \nimportation of certain \"curio and relic\" firearms simply because of their age and regardless of the \ndanger they may pose; the prohibition against ATF's current practice of collecting information on \nthe sale of multiple long guns in the Southwest Border region; and the prohibition against ATF \ndenying an application to import particular models or configurations of a shotgun that do not \nmeet the statutory \"sporting purposes\" test.  In addition, the Administration urges the Congress to \nrepeal a number of provisions made permanent in prior years, including a prohibition against \nrequiring firearms dealers to conduct physical inventories and a prohibition on changing the \ndefinition of \"curio and relic\" firearms.  \n \nWorking Capital Fund and Assets Forfeiture Fund Restrictions.  The Administration strongly \nopposes the limitations included in the bill for the Working Capital Fund and Assets Forfeiture \nFund that would severely restrict DOJ's ability to fund essential requirements of its financial \nmanagement system consolidation efforts, to pay for other vital unfunded capital equipment \nneeds, and to cover the costs of unanticipated expenses.  The Department must regain its ability \nto use the Working Capital Fund and Assets Forfeiture Fund spending authorities in order to \nminimize the financial impact to programs critical to public safety and national security while \nimproving financial reporting, accountability, and law enforcement capabilities.  \n \nMutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT). The Administration appreciates the Committee's \nsupport for MLAT process reform, which is critical to investigating crimes, working with foreign \npartners, and prosecuting terrorists and other criminals.  This funding will provide for an \nupdated, improved, and accelerated process to handle foreign governments' requests for evidence \nas well as enhance mutual relationships.  \n \nGuant\u00e1namo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 528 and \n529, which would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and \nfor the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guant\u00e1namo detainees \nin the United States.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar \nprovisions in prior legislation and has reiterated his call to Congress to lift the restrictions.  As \nthe President said in his State of the Union Address, \"this needs to be the year Congress lifts the \nremaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\"  \nOperating the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo weakens our national security by draining \nresources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners and emboldening violent \nextremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive \nBranch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to \ndetermine when and where to prosecute Guant\u00e1namo detainees based on the facts and \n3  circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Section 528 would, moreover, \nviolate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances. \n \nExecutive Office of the President \n \nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).  The Administration urges the Congress to \nprovide the requested funding level of $56.2 million for USTR.  The funding reduction would \nlimit USTR's ability to conduct major trade negotiations, enforce trade agreements, and pursue \nnew and existing trade disputes.  \n \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \n \nCommercial Crew Program.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for \nNASA, but is disappointed the bill does not provide the full funding request for the Commercial \nCrew Program.  The lower funding level for the program jeopardizes the goal of sending \nastronauts to the International Space Station on American spacecraft by 2017 and will likely \nextend the period of time NASA needs to rely on Russia for transport to and from the Station. \nThe Administration also encourages the Congress to support competition in the program, which \nis important to lowering risk and reducing prices in the long term.   \n \nSpace Technology Program.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not fund the full \nrequest for the Space Technology program.  Space Technology is important to reducing the cost \nand increasing the capability of NASA, other Government, and commercial space activities.   \n \nNational Science Foundation (NSF) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the Committee's support for NSF.  NSF invests in important \nresearch and education and lays the foundation for economic growth.  \n \nLegal Services Corporation (LSC) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided in the bill for LSC, which is \n$80 million below the FY 2015 Budget request.  At this funding level, tens of thousands of low-\nincome Americans, including many military families and veterans, would be denied assistance \nwith civil legal problems, impacting their ability to receive fair treatment in the courts.  The \nAdministration also opposes the Committee's decision not to lift the prohibition against filing \nclass action lawsuits or restrictions on the use of non-LSC funds by LSC grantees as requested in \nthe Budget.  \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nOther provisions in the bill, including sections 509, 519, and 527, would also raise constitutional \nconcerns in certain applications by intruding upon the President's constitutional authority over \ninternational diplomacy. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these concerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n4  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nOctober 28, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2374 \u2013 Retail Investor Protection Act \n(Rep.

The bill ignores the fact \nthat significant work has already been conducted in both agencies and that the agencies have \nincluded and continue to include the public, industry, and numerous stakeholders in their \nrulemaking processes.  Moreover, the two agencies are already working closely to avoid \nconflicting requirements for the regulated community, and this legislation would hamper \neffective coordination between the two agencies.  The bill would hinder efforts to protect \nconsumers from conflicts of interest among brokers, dealers, financial advisors, and others \nwhose incentives may be misaligned with investors, potentially leading to deceptive and abusive \npractices.    \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that American workers and retirees are able to \nreceive advice about how to invest their money in safe, secure, and transparent financial products \nthat is free from harmful conflicts of interest.  These ongoing rulemakings are designed to protect \ntrillions of dollars in retirement savings of millions of workers and retirees by ensuring that paid \nadvisors and other entities do not place their own financial interests over those of their \ncustomers.  This legislation would place an unnecessary obstacle in the way of these efforts to \nprevent such harmful conflicts of interest, which hurt businesses, consumers, and retirees and \ntheir families.  \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2374, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \n                    March 27, 2014 \n                                                                                             (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nSenate Amendment to H.R. 3979 \u2013 Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nExtension Act \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the Senate amendment to H.R. 3979, the \nEmergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2014. This bipartisan legislation \nwould restore emergency unemployment insurance benefits that have expired for 2.2 million \nunemployed Americans actively looking for work and would continue important reemployment \nservices to help connect them to jobs. Extending these benefits would not only help these \nfamilies pay their bills but it is also one of the most cost effective ways to strengthen the \neconomy, according to independent economists.  \n \nHistorically, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to make sure that unemployment \ninsurance continues for job-seekers during times when there are still too many Americans out of \nwork. The Congress should act immediately to pass this extension, restoring a vital economic \nlifeline for hardworking American families, while continuing to consider further extensions. The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress on this and other measures to \ncontinue to grow our economy and create jobs, and to help Americans looking for work.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  January 27, 2014 \n  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 1926 \u2013 Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 and National Association \nof Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2014 \n(Sen. Menendez, D-NJ, and 3 cosponsors) \n \nThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides a valuable public service by making \nflood insurance available to homeowners, renters, and business owners in communities across the \nNation.  In exchange, communities participating in the NFIP must adopt and enforce appropriate \nfloodplain management measures to mitigate future flood damage.  The Biggert-Waters Flood \nInsurance Reform Act of 2012 requires the NFIP to set premium rates for properties to reflect \ntrue flood risk in order to make the program more financially stable.  The Administration \nstrongly supports a phased transition to actuarially sound flood insurance rates, as provided for \nby that Act, in order to enable policyholders and communities to adjust to risk-based premiums.  \nTransitioning to actuarially sound rates will help ensure that the NFIP has adequate resources to \npay policyholders\u2019 future claims without increasing the program\u2019s debt levels.   \n \nTitle I of S. 1926 would delay implementation of provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood \nInsurance Reform Act of 2012 that require the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) \nto move to full risk-based premium rates for certain properties.  Delaying implementation of \nthese reforms would further erode the financial position of the NFIP, which is already $24 billion \nin debt.  This delay would also reduce FEMA's ability to pay future claims made by all \npolicyholders.  FEMA is working diligently with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a \nstudy on insurance affordability for economically distressed policyholders pursuant to the \nBiggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012.  The Administration recognizes that many \npolicyholders may be challenged financially by the new rates and remains committed to working \nwith the Congress to develop approaches that ensure economically distressed policyholders are \nnot unduly burdened while maintaining the financial stability of the NFIP.  \n \nThe Administration supports the policy goals of Title II of S. 1926, which would establish a \nNational Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) as a mechanism for \nindividuals and companies that sell insurance to be licensed to sell insurance in States other than \ntheir home State without having to be separately licensed in each State.   \n \nThe Administration, however, is concerned that the bill provides a process for conducting \ncriminal history records checks on individuals applying to become members of NARAB that is \ninconsistent with the normal process the FBI uses to conduct thousands of such background \nchecks.  The Administration believes the bill can be made consistent with current law in order to \nassure the benefits of an efficient and effective established process.  In addition, the \nAdministration has constitutional concerns with the requirement that the President reserve eight \nof the thirteen positions on the NARAB Board of Directors for State insurance commissioners, \nwhich appears to significantly constrict the pool of individuals from which the President would  be able to make those eight nominations.  This restriction appears to impermissibly limit the \nscope of the President's appointment power.  The Administration recommends that this \nrequirement be amended to expand the size of the pool of potential appointees.   \n \n*  *  *  *  *  *  * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n June 25, 2013 \n (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2231 \u2013 Offshore Energy and Jobs Act \n(Rep. Hastings, R-WA, and 11 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2231.  The bill would undermine the targeted, science-\nbased, and regionally-tailored offshore development strategy that the American people and the \nStates have helped develop. \n \nThe Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas \ndevelopment as part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy to increase domestic production and \nreduce dependence on foreign oil.  Since the President took office, America's dependence on \nforeign oil has decreased every year, and domestic oil and natural gas production has risen every \nyear.  In 2012, American oil production reached the highest level in two decades and natural gas \nproduction reached an all-time high.   \n \nThe Administration's current five-year strategy for offshore oil and gas leasing makes all of the \nhighest resource areas on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), including frontier areas in the \nAlaskan Arctic, available for exploration and development.  Together, these areas contain more than \n75 percent of the estimated, technically recoverable oil and gas resources in our oceans.  This plan \nwas developed following extensive input from the public, industry, States, Tribes, and others, and \nincorporates lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. \n \nH.R. 2231 would require the Department of the Interior to open a number of new areas on the OCS. \nThis action would be directed without Secretarial discretion to determine whether those areas are \nappropriate for leasing through balanced consideration of factors such as resource potential, State \nand local views and concerns, and the maturity of infrastructure needed to support oil and gas \ndevelopment, including response capabilities in the event of an oil spill.  The bill would mandate \nOCS lease sales along the east and west coast and elsewhere with inadequate consideration of \nmilitary use conflicts and without regard for significant issues, such as State and local concerns and \nimpacts on important commercial and recreational fisheries.  \n \nThe bill also would establish unworkable deadlines and substantive and procedural limitations on \nimportant environmental review, alternatives and mitigation considerations, and other analysis that \nis critical to complying with laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Clean Water Act.  Full \ncompliance with these laws is important for the protection of citizens, communities, and the \nenvironment, and is necessary in order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation. \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that American taxpayers receive a fair return from the \nsale of public resources.  As drafted, the revenue sharing provisions of H.R. 2231 would ultimately \nreduce the net return to taxpayers from development of the Federal resources directed to be leased \nunder the bill.  Consistent with the President's Budget, the Administration looks forward to working  with the Congress to improve the return to taxpayers from Federal energy development through \nroyalty reforms, incentives to diligent development of oil and gas leases, and improvements to \nrevenue collection processes not found in H.R. 2231.   \n \nFinally, while the Administration supports the statutory codification of the Administration's \nreorganization of the former Minerals Management Service, the Administration does not support the \nstructure, requirements or naming conventions proposed in H.R. 2231, which are duplicative, \nineffective and result in undue expense.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2231, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nDecember 3, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1105 \u2013 Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act \n(Rep.

The \nlegislation effectively provides a blanket registration and reporting exemption for private equity \nfunds, undermining advances in investor protection and regulatory oversight implemented by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform).   \n \nThe Administration is committed to building a safer, more stable financial system.  H.R. 1105 \nrepresents a step backwards from the progress made to date, given that private equity fund \nadvisers have been filing reports with the SEC for over a year.  The bill\u2019s passage would deny \ninvestors access to important information intended to increase transparency and accountability \nand to minimize conflicts of interest.  Moreover, H.R. 1105 would exempt private equity funds \nfrom the disclosure requirements that the Congress laid out in Wall Street Reform to allow \nregulators to assess potential systemic risks. \n \nPrivate equity funds are already subject to less stringent reporting requirements compared to \nother types of private funds and to an annual, rather than quarterly, filing requirement.

The President's \nBudget includes a number of proposals that would enhance and simplify charitable giving \nincentives for many individuals. \n \nHowever, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4719, which would \npermanently extend three current provisions that offer enhanced tax breaks for certain donations \nand add another two similar provisions without offsetting the cost.  If this same, unprecedented \napproach of making certain traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for \nthe other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits over the next ten \nyears, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief \nAct of 2013.  Just two months ago, House Republicans themselves passed a budget resolution \nthat required offsetting any tax extenders that were made permanent with other revenue \nmeasures.  \n  \nAs with other similar proposals, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the \ndeficit to continue and create tax breaks that primarily benefit higher-income individuals, while \ninsisting on offsetting the proposed extension of emergency unemployment benefits and the \ndiscretionary funding increases for defense and non-defense priorities such as research and \ndevelopment in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.  House Republicans also are making clear \ntheir priorities by rushing to make these tax cuts permanent without offsets even as the House \nRepublican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 26 million working families and students \nby letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and \neducation tax credits expire.  \n  \nThe Administration wants to work with Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen \nAmerica\u2019s social sector.

Rogers, R-KY) \nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 83, making appropriations for fiscal year \n(FY) 2015, and for other purposes.  The Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort to \ninclude full-year appropriations legislation for most Government functions that allows for \nplanning and provides certainty, while making progress toward appropriately investing in \neconomic growth and opportunity, and adequately funding national security requirements.  The \nAdministration also appreciates the authorities and funding provided to enhance the U.S. \nGovernment's response to the Ebola epidemic, and to implement the Administration's strategy to \ncounter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as well as investments for the President's early \neducation agenda, Pell Grants, the bipartisan, Manufacturing Institutes initiative, and extension \nof the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. \nHowever, the Administration objects to the inclusion of ideological and special interest riders in \nthe House bill. In particular, the Administration is opposed to the inclusion of a rider that would \namend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and weaken a critical \ncomponent of financial system reform aimed at reducing taxpayer risk.  Additionally, the \nAdministration is opposed to inclusion of a rider that would amend the Federal Election \nCampaign Act to allow individual donors to contribute to national political party committee \naccounts for conventions, buildings and recounts in amounts that are dramatically higher than \nwhat the law currently permits. \nFurthermore, the Administration is disappointed that the bill would fund the Department of \nHomeland Security through February 27, 2015, at last year's levels.

Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2609, making appropriations for \nEnergy and Water Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2014, and for other purposes.  The bill drastically underfunds critical investments that: develop \nAmerican energy sources to build a clean and secure energy future; develop and commercialize \nthe emerging technologies that create high-quality jobs and enhance the Nation's economic \ncompetiveness; and improve resilience against current and ongoing climate impacts that threaten \nour economy, public health, and natural resources.  The bill would leave U.S. competitiveness at \nrisk in new markets for clean energy industries such as advanced vehicles, advanced \nmanufacturing, energy efficiency for homes and businesses, and domestic renewable energy such \nas wind, solar, and biomass.  Furthermore, the legislation would cut essential national security \nefforts required to implement the President's nuclear strategy and advance counter-proliferation \nobjectives.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2609, his senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto the bill. \n \nIn addition, enacting H.R. 2609, while adhering to the overall spending limits in the House \nBudget's topline discretionary level for fiscal year (FY) 2014, would hurt our economy and \nrequire draconian cuts to middle-class priorities.  These cuts could result in hundreds of \nthousands of low-income children losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of \nchildren with disabilities losing Federal funding for their special education teachers and aides, \nthousands of Federal agents who can't enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend \nfugitives, and thousands of scientists without medical grants, which would slow research that \ncould lead to new treatments and cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, and hurt \nAmerica's economic competitiveness.  \n \nAlmost three months have passed since the deadline for action and the Congress has yet to \nappoint conferees and agree on a budget resolution.  Prior to consideration of appropriations bills \nthe Congress should complete an appropriate framework for all the appropriations bills that \nsupports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation \nand national security for our economy to compete in the future.  As such, the President's senior \nadvisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2609 and any other legislation that implements the \nHouse Republican Budget framework. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill.   \n \n \n  Department of Energy (DOE) \n \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  The Administration strongly \nopposes the level of funding provided for EERE activities.  The Committee bill proposes $746 \nmillion for EERE, which is $2.0 billion, or 73 percent, below the FY 2014 Budget request and \nwould be the lowest enacted level of funding in real terms for EERE in the history of the \nDepartment.  Funding reductions are disproportionately taken in EERE, dramatically cutting the \ncurrent level of critical Federal investments in innovative clean energy research and development \nat a time of significant global competition and progress.  The Committee bill would significantly \nreduce renewable electricity programs, derailing domestic efforts to build on past U.S. success in \ndoubling the renewable energy generated from wind and solar sources.  Reducing building \nefficiency funding by more than two-thirds would hinder development of cost-effective new \ntechnologies and appliance standards to save Americans money by increasing energy \nproductivity.  Insufficient levels of weatherization assistance funding would not sustain the full \nnetwork of State and local offices needed to assist the Nation's low-income households in \nreducing their energy bills.  The Committee bill also severely reduces the necessary activities to \nensure proper oversight and stewardship of investments in hundreds of existing grants and \ncontracts.  \n \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration strongly opposes \nthe level of funding provided for ARPA-E.  The Committee bill would reduce ARPA-E by 87 \npercent compared to the FY 2014 Budget request.  The funding reductions would severely \nimpact the ability of ARPA-E to fund high impact, potentially transformative energy research \nthat aims to entirely change the way the Nation generates, stores, and uses energy.  \n \nOffice of Science.  The Administration strongly opposes funding reductions to the Office of \nScience, which would reduce funding to below FY 2009 levels.  The proposed reductions would \neliminate all funding for new grants and likely lead to terminations of ongoing awards.  At this \nlevel, operations at all major scientific user facilities would be reduced or would cease, affecting \nsome 25,000 researchers.  Ongoing construction activities aimed at new facilities will be delayed \nor slowed, increasing overall long-run costs.  These reductions could severely impact U.S. \nleadership in many areas of science, including x-ray light sources and foundational research that \nwill benefit clean energy production and use.   \n \nOffice of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE).  The Committee bill combines EERE \nand OE into a single account with significantly reduced funding.  The Administration opposes \nthe level of funding provided for OE activities, which at $80 million is less than half the \nFY 2014 Budget request.  These reductions to investments in Smart Grid research and \ndevelopment, Clean Energy Transmission and Reliability, and other activities, in conjunction \nwith the lack of funding for an Electricity Systems Energy Innovation Hub, would significantly \nslow efforts to modernize and secure the electricity delivery grid and understand and respond to \nenergy emergencies.  \n \nRace to the Top for Energy Efficiency and Grid Modernization.  The Administration urges the \nCongress to provide the funding requested in the FY 2014 Budget for Race to the Top for Energy \nEfficiency and Grid Modernization, which would support State governments that implement \neffective policies and regulatory changes to cut energy waste, increase energy efficiency, and \nmodernize the grid.  This one-time funding would help achieve the goal of doubling American \nenergy productivity by 2030.   \n2  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The Administration strongly objects to the \nreduction to Naval Reactors, which would limit the NNSA Administrator's ability to address \ncurrent and emerging issues in the fleet, reduce the throughput to qualify nuclear operators by 21 \npercent, and risk meeting regulatory requirements.  The Committee bill delays the Spent Fuel \nHandling Recapitalization Project, potentially jeopardizing the operational availability of aircraft \ncarriers and submarines while increasing the project's cost by $335 million.  Furthermore, the \nAdministration objects to the $335 million reduction, including rescissions, to Weapons \nActivities.  This reduction would weaken facility operations, construction initiatives, and \nstockpile support activities, all of which directly support the President's nuclear strategy as \nexpressed in the Nuclear Posture Review.  The reduction would significantly increase the risk of \nschedule delays for these key components of the Administration's nuclear strategy.  It would also \nundercut the ability to maintain the nuclear stockpile by delaying the modernization of the \nNation's plutonium manufacturing capability.   \n \nYucca Mountain.  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's direction to fund the \nYucca Mountain geological repository project.  The Administration is disappointed that the \nCommittee has failed to embrace the practical solutions proposed in the President's Nuclear \nWaste Strategy that were based on the concepts put forward by the non-partisan Blue Ribbon \nCommission.  This priority in the FY 2014 Budget is comprised of important elements for a \nsuccessful waste program, such as consent-based siting, interim storage of waste, and program \nfunding reforms that are essential to the success of a Nuclear Waste Program.   \n \nTitle XVII Loan Guarantee Program.  The Administration strongly opposes the $22 million \nadministrative expenses funding level provided for Title XVII programs, which would severely \nundermine DOE's ability to monitor the existing portfolio and diminish the quality of due \ndiligence on new projects.  Because the Committee bill fails to provide sufficient capacity to \neffectively originate and monitor direct loans and loan guarantees, the bill significantly increases \nthe risk of failed loans and guarantees that will lead to future costs to the Federal Government in \nthe form of permanent indefinite authority under the Federal Credit Reform Act.   \n \nStatutory by Reference Provision.  The Administration urges the Congress to remove section \n301(d) of the bill, which incorporates the text as well as the specific funding directions of the \nCommittee bill report into the statute by reference.  Enactment of this provision would limit \nflexibility of the Department to manage programs and projects efficiently.   \n \nWeatherization Assistance Program.  Section 307 of the bill seeks to permanently block existing \nWeatherization Assistance Program authorizations, reducing the efficiency of the program by \nlowering the maximum income level for retrofit assistance eligibility, the maximum financial \nassistance per weatherized home, and the maximum allocation allowed for Training and \nTechnical Assistance from current levels. \n \nCorps of Engineers (Corps) \nOverall Funding.  The Committee bill provides nearly $4.68 billion for the Corps civil works \nprogram, $50 million less than requested in the FY 2014 Budget.  Within this total, the \nAdministration urges the Congress to allow the Corps to begin work on select new starts \nproposed in the Budget.  These include a proposed study to evaluate flood risks across the Nation \nand a programmatic effort to create a more robust civil works infrastructure in light of increased \n3  risk of extreme weather, and to provide for the requested $7 million increase for the Corps \nregulatory program.   \nInland Waterways.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued strong support of \ncost-sharing of inland waterways capital investments, and the inclusion of the language proposed \nin the Budget to increase the total authorized cost for the Olmsted Locks and Dam project.  \n \nClean Water Act.  Sections 107 and 112 of the bill would prevent the use of funds to address \nknown deficiencies and regulatory uncertainties related to Clean Water Act regulations in order \nto protect important aquatic resources while supporting economic development.   \n \nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project \n \nOverall Funding.  The Committee bill provides $911 million for the Bureau of Reclamation and \nthe Central Utah Project, $85 million below the FY 2014 Budget request.  The Administration \nurges the Congress to increase funding for the Bureau of Reclamation to the level requested and \nto allocate funding to priority conservation, science, and technology programs.   \n \nCentral Utah Project (CUP).  The Administration urges the Congress to consolidate CUP into \nthe Bureau of Reclamation as requested in the FY 2014 Budget.  The consolidation would \nsimplify many administrative, budgeting, and reporting tasks while not adversely affecting \nproject performance. \n \nSan Joaquin River Restoration.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's \nelimination of funding for this program, which would undermine the San Joaquin River \nRestoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water \nsupply impacts.   \n \nCivilian Pay Raise \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for \nFederal civilian employees.

However, the Administration has concerns with H.R. 2218 \nthat need to be addressed for the legislation to adequately protect public health and the environment. \n \nTo ensure that H.R. 2218 provides for the safe management and disposal of coal ash, important gaps \nshould be filled, including:  (1) authority to address inactive or abandoned disposal sites and for \nareas where coal ash is used in large scale fill operations; (2) clear and appropriate authority for \ntaking potential corrective action on unlined or leaking impoundments or units; (3) groundwater \nprotection standards that address the constituents of coal combustion residuals identified in H.R. \n2218; and (4) clear minimum standards for EPA to identify and remedy State program deficiencies.  \nAdditionally, the Administration is concerned that overly broad preemption language in the bill may \nunintentionally block important protections under the Clean Water Act. \n \nThe 2008 failure of a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, which spilled more than five \nmillion cubic yards of coal ash and will require $1.2 billion for clean-up, was a stark reminder of \nthe need for safe disposal and management of coal ash.    \n \nThe Administration would like to work with Congress to address the important issues with H.R. \n2218 to allow for development, implementation, and enforcement of appropriate standards for \nfacilities managing coal combustion residuals, while encouraging the beneficial use of this \neconomically important material. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nSeptember 18, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1526 - Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy Communities Act \n(Rep. Hastings, R-WA, and 22 cosponsors) \n \nWhile supportive of working with States and communities to restore National Forests and \nrangeland, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1526, which includes numerous harmful \nprovisions that impair Federal management of federally-owned lands and undermine many \nimportant existing public land and environmental laws, rules, and processes.  The bill would \nsignificantly harm sound long-term management of these Federal lands for continued \nproductivity and economic benefit as well as for the long-term health of the wildlife and \necological values sustained by these holdings.  H.R. 1526, which includes unreasonable \nrestrictions on certain Federal agency actions, would negatively impact the effective U.S. \nstewardship of Federal lands and natural resources, undertaken on behalf of all Americans.  The \nbill also would create conflicts with existing statutory requirements that could generate \nsubstantial and complex litigation.  A number of the Administration\u2019s concerns with H.R. 1526 \nare outlined below.     \nTitle I would negatively impact forest resources and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) \ncurrent statutory obligations to manage forest lands by requiring USDA to sell no less than 50 \npercent of the sustained yield from the bill\u2019s newly created Forest Reserve Revenue Areas \n(FRRA).  The Administration does not support specifying timber harvest levels in statute, which \ndoes not take into account public input, environmental analyses, multiple use management or \necosystem changes.  The bill would create a fiduciary responsibility to beneficiary counties to \nmanage FRRAs to satisfy the annual volume requirement, which may create significant financial \nliability for the United States.  It would also impede National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) \ncompliance for projects within FRRA, which undermines the reasoned consideration of the \nenvironmental effects of Federal agency actions.  The bill also would establish significant \nbarriers to the courts by imposing a requirement that plaintiffs post a bond for the Federal \ngovernment\u2019s costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees.    \nTitle II would give States the ability to determine management on Federal lands, including \nprioritized management treatments for hazardous fuel reductions and forest health projects \nwithout consultation with Federal land agencies, public involvement, or consideration of sound \nscience and management options.  The title would also accelerate commercial grazing and timber \nharvests without appropriate environmental review and public involvement, and would impede \ncompliance with NEPA and Endangered Species Act (ESA) requirements.  The Administration \nsupports early public participation in Federal land management.  The bill would mandate \nprocesses that shortchange collaboration and would lead to more conflict and delay.  Further, this \ntitle\u2019s mandated use of limited budgetary resources would likely reduce funding for other critical \nprojects.  \nTitle III would transfer from Federal agencies to a State-appointed Trust, the rights and  responsibilities to manage most lands covered by the Oregon and California Railroad and Coos \nBay Wagon Road Grant Lands Act (O&C) lands, and attempts to create exemptions from NEPA, \nESA and other land management statutes.  This would undermine appropriate management and \nstewardship of these lands, which belong to all Americans, would compromises habitat for \nthreatened and endangered species, and would create legal uncertainty over management of these \nlands as well as increase litigation risk.   Further, Title III also contains seriously objectionable \nlimitations on the President\u2019s existing authority under the Antiquities Act to designate new \nNational Monuments in this region.  \nTitle IV would remove authority from the Secretary of Agriculture for management of National \nForest lands designated as Community Forest Demonstration Areas, while requiring the \nSecretary to be responsible for a number of management actions including fire presuppression, \nsuppression, and rehabilitation.  This title\u2019s proposed management strategies would create a \npatchwork of management schemes and difficulties for the agency to meet other statutory and \nregulatory requirements.  Federal environmental laws should apply on Federal lands; however, \nTitle IV creates exceptions to, and potentially exemptions from the normal application of these \nlaws, including the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the ESA.  \nIf H.R. 1526 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n                    April 30, 2014 \n                    (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 2223 \u2013 Minimum Wage Fairness Act \n(Sen. Harkin, D-Iowa, 37 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2223, the Minimum Wage Fairness \nAct.  This legislation would gradually raise the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per \nhour, and its effects would benefit more than 28 million hardworking Americans nationwide, the \nmajority of whom are women.  \n \nNo American who works full-time should live in poverty, yet a full-time worker making \nminimum wage only earns $14,500 a year.  Furthermore, the Federal minimum wage has not kept \npace with the rising costs of basic necessities for working families and today is worth about 20 \npercent less than it was in the early 1980s.  In addition, because S. 2223 not only raises the \nFederal minimum wage but also indexes it to inflation and increases the tipped minimum wage, \nthe legislation would ensure that minimum wage workers' pay keeps up with increased costs.  \nIncreasing the minimum wage not only helps earners, but also results in many businesses \nbenefitting from increased worker productivity and reduced turnover.  And a higher minimum \nwage can help boost the economy because studies show workers spend the extra dollars they earn \nat businesses in their communities.  \n \nHistorically, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to raise the minimum wage.  The \nCongress should act immediately to pass this legislation to reward hard work.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress on this and other measures to \ncontinue to build real, lasting economic security for the middle class and create more \nopportunities for every hardworking American to get ahead.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n  June 11, 2013 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.

However, the Administration opposes \npassage of H.R. 1256, which would modify Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act puts in place a number of requirements that bring \ntransparency to and enhance the stability of derivatives markets.  These reforms will collectively \nstrengthen the weak and outdated regulatory regime that played a significant role in the crisis that \ncaused devastating damage to the U.S. economy and the financial well-being of American families. \n \nRegulators are making significant progress with a number of derivatives-related reforms.  As part of \nthese efforts, regulators are already coordinating to address the issues raised in H.R. 1256, while \ntaking into account the characteristics of the particular markets they regulate.  Given these ongoing \ncoordination efforts, passage of this bill would be premature and disruptive to the current and \nongoing implementation of the reforms.  The Administration believes regulators should be given the \ntime necessary to complete their work.  The Administration consequently opposes passage of H.R. \n1256, which would preempt ongoing work and slow the implementation of these vital reforms. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n \nMarch 4, 2014 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF DMINISTRATION OLICY\n       \nH.R. 3826 - Electricity Security and Affordability Act \n(Rep. Whitfield, R-Kentucky, and 94 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3826, which would undermine the public health \nprotections of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and stop U.S. progress in cutting dangerous carbon \npollution from power plants.  In 2009, EPA determined that Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pollution \nthreatens Americans' health and welfare by leading to long-lasting climate changes that are \nalready having a range of negative effects on human health and the environment.  Power plants \naccount for roughly one-third of all domestic GHG emissions.  While the United States limits \nemissions of arsenic, mercury, and lead pollution from power plants, there are no national limits \non power plant carbon pollution. As part of his Climate Action Plan, the President directed the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to work with States, utilities, and other stakeholders to \ndevelop standards to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from power plants.  H.R. \n3826 would block those important efforts, threatening the health and safety of Americans. \n \nH.R. 3826 would nullify proposed carbon pollution standards for future power plants, and \narbitrarily restrict the available technologies that could be considered for any new standards.  \nThis requirement would stifle progress in reducing carbon pollution by discouraging the adoption \nof currently available and effective technology, and would limit further development of cutting-\nedge clean energy technologies.  Finally, the bill could delay indefinitely reductions in carbon \npollution from existing power plants by prohibiting forthcoming rules from taking effect until \nCongress passes legislation setting the effective date of the rules.  This would undermine \nregulatory certainty and prevent timely action on standards for the power sector -- the largest \nsource of carbon pollution in the country.   \n \nSince it was enacted in 1970, and amended in 1977 and 1990, each time with strong bipartisan \nsupport, the CAA has improved the Nation's air quality and protected public health.  Over that \nsame period of time, the economy has grown over 200 percent while emissions of key pollutants \nhave decreased by more than 70 percent.  Forty years of clean air regulation has shown that a \nstrong economy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.   \n \nThe Administration stands ready to work with Congress to enact comprehensive legislation to \nachieve meaningful reductions in carbon pollution.  However, the President has made it clear that \nif Congress fails to act to protect future generations from the threat of climate change, his \nAdministration will.   \n \nBecause H.R. 3826 threatens the health and economic welfare of future generations by blocking \nimportant standards to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector, if the President is \npresented with H.R. 3826, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  February 25, 2014 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3865 - Temporary Prohibition on IRS from Modifying  \nTax-Exemption Requirements for Social Welfare Organizations \n  (Rep. Camp, R-Michigan, and 66 cosponsors)  \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3865, which would prohibit the Department of the \nTreasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from clarifying the standards that organizations \nmust satisfy to qualify for tax-exempt status.  Under current law, organizations qualify as tax-\nexempt organizations \u201coperated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare\u201d if they are \nprimarily engaged in promoting in some way the common good and general welfare of the \npeople.  The relevant Treasury and IRS rules have been in place since 1959 and are broadly \nrecognized as unclear.  The proposed legislation would prevent any revisions or clarifications to \nthose rules.  Thus, it could prevent the IRS from administering the tax code more effectively and \nfrom providing greater clarity to organizations seeking tax-exempt status. \n \nH.R. 3865 would prevent Treasury and the IRS from issuing, for one year from the date of \nenactment, any generally applicable guidance relating to the standards for tax-exemption under \nsection 501(c)(4) as a social welfare organization.  In addition, H.R. 3865 would require the IRS \nto continue to use the standard and definitions in effect on January 1, 2010, to determine whether \nan organization qualifies for tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(4).  The lack of clarity of \nthese standards has resulted in confusion and difficulty administering the Code, as well as delays \nin the processing of applications for tax-exempt status.  The Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration and the National Taxpayer Advocate, among others, have recommended \nclarifying the current rules. \n \nConsistent with these recommendations, Treasury and the IRS recently issued a notice of \nproposed rulemaking (NPRM) that provides guidance on the definition of candidate-related \npolitical activity for purposes of determining the \u201cprimary activity\u201d of a social welfare \norganization and solicits public comment on a number of related issues.  This NPRM is the first \nstep in a standard rulemaking process intended to clarify the rules and to provide greater certainty \nfor organizations seeking tax-exempt status.  The notice and comment process allows for all \nconcerned parties to provide input and comments before any changes to the rules are effected.  \nTreasury and the IRS will carefully consider any and all such comments before issuing any \nfurther guidance, and they will follow standard agency rulemaking procedures. \n \nFor the reasons described above, the Administration strongly opposes the proposed legislation.

This legislation would \nprovide for continuity of funding for the Highway Trust Fund during the height of the summer \nconstruction season and keep Americans at work repairing the Nation's crumbling roads, bridges, \nand transit systems. \n \nHowever, this legislation only provides a short-term fix to the Highway Trust Fund.  It does not \naddress the continued need to pass a long-term authorization bill that creates jobs and provides \ncertainty for cities, States, and businesses.  Congress should work to pass a long-term \nauthorization bill well before the expiration date set forth in H.R. 5021.  The President has been \nvery clear that increasing investment in the Nation\u2019s infrastructure is a top priority.  That is why \nthe President laid out a vision for a 21st century surface transportation infrastructure, the GROW \nAMERICA Act, which would streamline project approval processes and implement innovative \ntransportation policies that will make better use of taxpayer dollars while supporting millions of \njobs and positioning the Nation's economy for lasting growth.  That proposal is fully paid for \nthrough existing revenues and by reforming business taxes to help create jobs and spur \ninvestment while eliminating loopholes that reward companies for moving profits overseas. \n \nThe Administration is focused every day on what can be done to expand opportunity for every \nAmerican.

With authorization for farm and food related programs set to expire this year, it is critical that \nthe Congress pass legislation that provides certainty for rural America and includes needed reforms \nand savings.  The new farm bill should promote rural development, preserve a farm safety net, \nmaintain strong nutrition programs, encourage the development of local and regional markets, \nenhance conservation, honor our international trade commitments, including under the World Trade \nOrganization, and advance agricultural research.  In light of the Nation's long-term fiscal challenge, \nthe legislation should also contribute significantly to deficit reduction. \n \nThe President's Budget provides a strong safety net for farmers that protect agriculture from losses, \nwhile instituting needed risk-based reforms to reduce spending for some agricultural programs.  The \nAgriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 makes meaningful progress toward supporting the \nAdministration's goals.  Notable reforms include eliminating the direct payment system and \ntightening payment and eligibility requirements.  The Administration supports the Senate's efforts to \nconsolidate and streamline conservation assistance, which will reduce administrative burdens on \nfarmers and ranchers and improve environmental outcomes, and believes that crop insurance \npayments should be tied to the Nation's soil conservation and wetland protection goals.  The bill's \nfunding for bioenergy programs will enhance our energy security while supporting innovation and \ngrowth in rural economies.   \n \nConsistent with the President's Budget, the Administration looks forward to working with the \nCongress to achieve crop insurance and commodity program savings that are not contained in \nS. 954, while at the same time strengthening the farm safety net in times of need and supporting the \nnext generation of farmers.  The Administration also strongly supports the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (SNAP), a cornerstone of our Nation's food assistance safety net, which is why \nit was not subject to cuts in the President's Budget.

The agencies\u2019 rulemaking, grounded in science, is essential to ensure clean water \nfor future generations and reduce regulatory uncertainty, and is responsive to calls for \nrulemaking from Congress, industry, and community stakeholders as well as decisions of the \nU.S. Supreme Court. \n \nClean water is vital for the success of the Nation\u2019s businesses, agriculture, energy development, \nand the health of our communities.  More than 115 million Americans get their drinking water \nfrom rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that are at risk of pollution from upstream sources.  The \nprotection of wetlands is vital for hunting and fishing.  When Congress passed the CWA in 1972, \nto restore the Nation\u2019s waters, it recognized that to have healthy communities downstream, we \nneed to protect the smaller streams and wetlands upstream.  Clarifying the scope of the CWA \nhelps to protect clean water, safeguard public health, and strengthen the economy. \n \nH.R. 5078 would derail current efforts to clarify the scope of the CWA, hamstring future \nregulatory efforts, and create significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance.  \nIt would deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty needed to invest in projects \nthat rely on clean water.

Enacting this legislation would undermine key elements of the \nhealth law, facilitating further efforts to repeal a law that is already helping millions of Americans \nstay on their parents' plans until age 26, millions more who are getting free preventive care that \ncatches illness early on, and thousands of children with pre-existing conditions who are now covered. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2667 and H.R. 2668, he would veto them. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nSeptember 19, 2013 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nSenate Substitute Amendment to H.R. 527 \u2013 The Responsible Helium Administration and \nStewardship Act \n(Sen. Wyden, D-OR, and Sen. Murkowski, R-AK)  \nThe Administration strongly supports the Senate substitute amendment, the High Technology \nJobs Preservation Act, to H.R. 527, the Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship \nAct.  The substitute amendment would prevent the October 7, 2013, termination of the Federal \nprogram for crude helium sale, storage, and delivery.  The impending abrupt shutdown of this \nprogram would cause a spike in helium prices that would harm many U.S. industries and disrupt \nnational security programs.  Instead, the substitute amendment would provide for an orderly \ntransition of the Federal Government out of the helium market. \n  \nThe Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) operates the Federal \nHelium Program as a strategic natural resource.  This program supplies about 42 percent of U.S. \ncrude helium and about 35 percent of the world\u2019s demand.  Helium is an essential resource for \nthe aerospace industry, computer chip and optical fiber manufacturing, for medical uses \nincluding MRI magnet cooling, lung tissue visualization, heart catheterization methods, and \nmedical lasers, and aluminum helium arc welding.  Helium is also used in national defense \napplications such as rocket engine testing and purging, surveillance devices, air-to-air missiles \nand scientific balloons.  Under current law, the Federal Helium Program is scheduled to end \non October 7, 2013, absent a new Congressional authorization.  This legislation would provide \nthe BLM with the authority necessary to continue this critical program. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJanuary 9, 2014 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3811 \u2013 Health Exchange Security and Transparency Act of 2014 \n(Rep. Pitts, R-PA., and 74 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration believes Americans\u2019 personally-identifiable information should be protected \nwherever it resides, and that all Americans deserve to know if that information has been \nimproperly exposed. Accordingly, the Federal Government adheres to extensive requirements for \nsafeguarding against and responding to the breach of personally-identifiable \ninformation.  Additionally, the Administration called upon the Congress in May 2011 to pass \nnational data breach legislation reflecting a real solution to this complex issue. \n \nThe Federal Government has already put in place an effective and efficient system for securing \npersonally-identifiable information in the Health Insurance Marketplaces and providing \nconsumers notification if their personally-identifiable information has been compromised. When \nconsumers fill out their online Marketplace applications, they can trust that the information that \nthey are providing is protected by stringent security standards.  \n \nThe components of the HealthCare.gov website that are now operational comply with Federal \nsecurity standards.  Security testing is conducted on an ongoing basis using industry best \npractices designed to appropriately safeguard consumers\u2019 personal information.   \nThe Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3811 because it would create unrealistic and \ncostly paperwork requirements that do not improve the safety or security of personally-\nidentifiable information in the Health Insurance Marketplaces.  For example, the indiscriminate \nreporting requirement in H.R. 3811 may seriously impede the law enforcement investigation of a \nbreach.  Unlike existing requirements, H.R. 3811 requires expensive and unnecessary \nnotification for the compromise of publicly-available information, even if there is no reasonable \nrisk that information could be used to cause harm.  \n \nThe Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care and has already \nimproved many aspects of the Nation's health care system.  Beginning this year, millions of low- \nand middle-income Americans will be eligible to receive tax credits to help them purchase \ninsurance and cost-sharing reductions to help with out-of-pocket expenses for coverage.  Tens of \nmillions of Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to pre-existing medical \nconditions will now be covered.  The nearly one in two Americans under the age of 65 with \npre-existing medical conditions will have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they \ncannot be dropped from their health plan or denied coverage because of those conditions.  The \nAffordable Care Act is also bringing down the cost of health care for millions of families and \nbusinesses and will also reduce the Federal budget deficit.  \n \nH.R. 3811 would impose an administratively burdensome reporting requirement that is less \neffective than existing industry standards and those already in place for Federal Agencies that \npossess such information.  As such, the Administration opposes its passage. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJuly 17, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 5 \u2013 Student Success Act \n(Rep. Kline, R-MN, and 12 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5, the Student Success Act.  The Administration \nbelieves that the Congress must act to reform the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), to support State efforts to \nadopt and implement State-developed standards that ensure every student graduates from high \nschool prepared for college and a career; create a fairer, flexible, and focused accountability \nsystem; support effective teachers and leaders; and promote innovation in our public education \nsystem.  These principles are reflected in the flexibility that the Administration has offered to \nStates with respect to the Federally-mandated, one-size-fits-all standards of NCLB.  States' \noverwhelming participation in ESEA flexibility indicates that they already are committed to \nmoving toward this vision of comprehensive reform.   \n \nInstead, H.R. 5 would represent a significant step backwards in the effort to help our Nation's \nchildren and their families prepare for their futures.  Among other things, the bill would not \nsupport State efforts to hold students to standards that will prepare them for college and careers; \nwould not support our international economic competitiveness; would virtually eliminate \naccountability for the growth and achievement of historically underserved populations; would \nfail to support meaningful improvement and reforms at the Nation's lowest-performing schools; \nwould eliminate maintenance-of-effort requirements, which could reduce overall investment in \npublic education; and would not reauthorize key Administration priorities, including effective \ninitiatives like Race to the Top, Investing in Innovation, and Promise Neighborhoods.  \n \nIt is important that ESEA reauthorization ensures that all students have access to a high-quality \neducation.  The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress to strengthen \nour Nation's schools through a bipartisan reauthorization of ESEA. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJanuary 8, 2014 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2279 - Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act \n(Rep. Gardner, R-CO) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2279 because it would make a number of problematic \nchanges to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \n(CERCLA), which could delay remediation of national priority cleanup projects with the most \nurgent human health and safety risks.  CERCLA's existing Federal/State partnership provisions \nhave been the cornerstone in developing strategies to address the releases of hazardous \nsubstances and to remediate contaminated sites across the country.  \n \nH.R. 2279 would unnecessarily increase the potential for litigation between the Federal \ngovernment and the States, negatively impacting the timeliness and number of \ncleanups.  Specifically, the bill would expand the waiver of sovereign immunity to all current or \nformer Federal facilities as well as those listed on the National Priorities List, and would require \nFederal agencies to comply with State-imposed remediation requirements irrespective of land \nuse plans, site ownership, or national funding prioritizations.  It also would allow a State to seek \ninjunctive relief, civil penalties, and the imposition of sanctions for \"enforcement of any \ninjunctive relief\" against the United States.  The Administration already works closely with the \nStates to ensure that remedial goals for the protection of public health are met and that the States' \npreferences and requirements are taken into account. \n \nFederal agencies often face significant challenges in attempting to carry out response actions due \nto lack of funding.  Thus, agencies have developed prioritization approaches to identify the \nhighest risk sites for immediate action in a \"worst first\" approach to cleanup.  H.R. 2279 may \nimpact this prioritization if Federal agencies face litigation and the imposition of civil penalties \non lower risk sites, ultimately reducing the funds available for on-going and future remediation \nefforts.  \n \nIn the context of CERCLA cleanups, the bill would allow States to impose restrictions on \nfederally-owned lands that could interfere with current and future uses of those properties.  This \nwould effectively allow States to control the land use of Federal sites, including Department of \nDefense installations, Department of Energy laboratories, and Federal land management agency \nproperties, significantly impairing the use of those facilities for mission-specific functions and \npotentially disrupting land transfer negotiations.   \n \nThe bill would disrupt on-going reform efforts being undertaken by Federal regulators to ensure \nthe sufficiency of appropriate financial assurance requirements needed to cover the cleanup of \nhazardous substance releases.  The bill's requirements could result in significant site cleanup \ndelays, endangering public health and the environment. \n \nFor the reasons stated above, the President's senior advisors would recommend he veto this bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nNovember 12, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2655 - Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2013 \n(Rep. Smith, R-TX, and seven cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration opposes H.R. 2655, which would limit the discretion of courts by requiring \nmonetary sanctions for violations of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 11 \nrequires attorneys to certify that pleadings are not presented for any improper purpose, such as to \nharass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.  H.R. 2655 would \nchange Rule 11 by requiring monetary sanctions (including court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees) for a \nRule 11 violation and by eliminating the safe harbor that now allows attorneys to correct or \nwithdraw a filing before Rule 11 proceedings commence.  The bill would circumvent the usual \nprocedure for amending the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n \nWhile H.R. 2655 is intended to curb a perceived increase in frivolous litigation, the bill would \nactually increase litigation.  By creating an automatic financial incentive, and by removing the \nsafe-harbor period, the proposed changes to Rule 11 could dramatically increase the number of \nsanctions motions, including those filed against Federal government attorneys, and \ncorrespondingly increase the risk of financial exposure for any conduct that might be considered \na Rule 11 violation.  In short, H.R. 2655 would raise the amount and cost of civil litigation and \nprovide more opportunity for unnecessary delay and harassment. \n \nThe Administration is particularly concerned that the new requirements could be used to target \nconsumer and civil rights plaintiffs.  Consumer abuse and civil rights cases rely heavily on the \ndiscovery process to prove the merits of their claims.  In addition, civil rights cases often seek to \nchallenge the law or to extend existing precedents.  The threat of mandatory sanctions for failure \nto withstand a Rule 11 challenge could chill meritorious claims by deterring worthy plaintiffs \nfrom challenging existing laws or seeking novel interpretations of them. \n \nThe bill is opposed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the principal policymaking \nbody for the Judicial Branch charged with proposing amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure under the careful, deliberate process outlined in the Rules Enabling Act.  Congress has \ntasked the Judicial Conference to serve as the principal policymaking body for the Judicial \nBranch.  Congress has thus empowered the Federal judiciary to make its own procedural rules, \nretaining the right to review those rules and to accept, modify, or reject them.  H.R. 2655 is an \nattempt to amend the rules directly, over the objections of the Judicial Conference. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \n                    May 19, 2014 \n                    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 4435 \u2013 Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2015 \n(Rep. McKeon, R-California, and 1 cosponsor) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s continued support of \nour national defense and supports a number of the provisions in H.R. 4435, the Howard P. \n\u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015.  In particular, \nthe Administration appreciates the support of the Committee for authorities that assist the \nwarfighter in operating in unconventional and irregular warfare and countering unconventional \nthreats, support capacity-building efforts with foreign military forces, and support on-going \noperations, as well as the Committee\u2019s support for programs that would improve the health and \nwell-being of the force.   \n \nWhile there are a number of areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration has \nserious concerns with provisions that would constrain the ability of the Department of Defense \n(DOD) to align military capabilities and force structure with the President\u2019s defense strategy and \nto reduce unneeded costs.  As we face this time of uncertainty in both the fiscal and security \nenvironments, we must ensure that scarce resources are directed to the highest priorities that our \nmilitary requires to keep the Nation safe and prepare for future threats.  \n \nIn the Administration's view, the risk to the Nation will grow significantly should Congress not \naccept reforms proposed in the FY 2015 Budget.  The bill does not include meaningful \ncompensation reforms and other cost saving measures, rejects many of the Department\u2019s \nproposed force structure changes, and restricts DOD\u2019s ability to manage its weapon systems and \ninfrastructure.  In aggregate, the Committee\u2019s changes to the President\u2019s proposed defense \nprogram would eliminate more than $50 billion in savings over the next five years and force \nDOD to alter its recommended balance among capability, capacity, and readiness in order to \nretain unnecessary overhead and force structure.  The Committee\u2019s changes increase the risk to \nthe Department\u2019s ability to implement the President\u2019s defense strategy, contributing to a military \nthat will be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.  In addition, the bill\u2019s \ncontinuation of unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees held at the detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, undermines our national security.   \n \nIf the bill presented to the President impedes the ability of the Administration to properly direct \nscarce resources for our military, or continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees, the \nPresident\u2019s senior advisors would recommend to the President that he veto the bill. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks  forward to reviewing a classified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns \non classified programs.   \n \nGuantanamo Detainee Restrictions:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1032 and \n1033, which would prohibit the use of funds for the construction or modification of any facility \nto house Guantanamo detainees in the United States and for the transfer of detainees to the \nUnited States.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar \nprovisions in prior legislation and has reiterated his call to Congress to lift the restrictions.  As \nthe President said in his State of the Union Address, \u201cthis needs to be the year Congress lifts the \nremaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\u201d  \nOperating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens our national security by draining \nresources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners and emboldening violent \nextremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive \nBranch\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to \ndetermine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and \ncircumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Section 1033 would, moreover, \nviolate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances.   \n \nCompensation Reform:  To achieve a proper balance between DOD\u2019s obligation to provide \ncompetitive pay and benefits to service members and its responsibility to provide troops the \nfinest training and equipment possible, it is imperative to slow the growth of basic pay and \nhousing allowances, modernize military healthcare, and reform how commissaries operate.  The \nAdministration strongly encourages members of Congress to support these reforms, which would \nsave $2 billion in FY 2015 and $31 billion through FY 2019.  While the Administration looks \nforward to the recommendations of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization \nCommission on long-term compensation, modernization, and retirement issues, delaying DOD's \nholistic package of proposed initial changes will only result in increased costs and risks to the \nforce.   \n \nRestricting Army National Guard and Active Army Force Structure Changes:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 1050, which would limit Army National Guard and \nActive Army force structure changes.  As DOD transitions out of a decade of war, military end \nstrength and force structure changes are necessary to shape a force that is more agile and \ntechnologically superior and ready to respond to requirements.  These changes are necessary to \nallow DOD to make necessary investments in readiness, modernization, and training. \n \nLimitations on Retirement of Weapon Systems:  The Administration strongly objects to \nprovisions that would restrict the Department\u2019s ability to retire weapon systems and aircraft \nplatforms in accordance with current strategic and operational plans.  These divestitures are \ncritical and would free up funding for higher priority programs.  Specifically, the Administration \nstrongly objects to sections 131, 132, and 1026, which are inconsistent with DOD\u2019s fiscal \nconstraints and current priorities.  Section 132 would restrict DOD from obligating or expending \nfunds to retire A-10 aircraft.  Divesting the A-10 will save over $4.2 billion through FY 2019.  \nThe joint force will retain several multi-mission aircraft capable of performing the close air \nsupport mission.  The Administration also objects to the Committee authorizing Overseas \nContingency Operations (OCO) funding for the continued operation of the A-10 fleet.  \nLongstanding criteria for OCO eligibility clearly exclude such uses. \n \n2  Likewise, section 1026, which would restrict DOD from obligating or expending any FY 2015 \nfunds for the retirement, preparation for retirement, inactivation, or storage of a cruiser or dock \nlanding ship, is unaffordable over the long term.  Further, this language would limit the Navy\u2019s \nability to implement a phased modernization program that would provide eleven modernized \ncruisers and three dock landing ships through the 2030\u2019s.  This provision also directs \nmodernization of two cruisers in FY 2015, which does not provide the Navy sufficient time to \nappropriately plan and purchase the required long lead-time materials.  Finally, section 131 \nwould prohibit the cancellation or modification of the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program \n(AMP).  DOD plans to replace the C-130 AMP with a less expensive, fully capable alternative \nthat has been validated by independent study to ensure that the fleet continues to meet future \nrequirements. \n \nBase Realignment and Closure (BRAC):  The Administration strongly objects to section 2711, \nwhich would preclude any funds being authorized for use toward an additional BRAC round. \nThis impairs the ability of the Executive Branch to plan for contingencies or make other needed \nadjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration \nstrongly urges the Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which would allow \nDOD to rightsize its infrastructure while providing important assistance to affected communities. \n Without authorization for a new round of BRAC, DOD may not properly align the military\u2019s \ninfrastructure with the needs of our evolving force structure, which is critical to ensuring that \nlimited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security.   \n \nNational Guard Civil and Defense Support:  The Administration strongly objects to section 513, \nwhich would authorize Governors and Adjutants General of the various States to expend DOD \nfunds to employ the National Guard of their States to perform support operations, missions, or \nactivities in support of a civil authority of a State or Federal agency.  This unwarranted intrusion \non the authorities of the President and the Secretary of Defense would impose significant fiscal \nburdens on an already shrinking Defense budget in order to fund non-Defense missions, would \nexpose DOD to legal and fiscal risks for missions not under its control, and would circumvent \nthe national response system.  \n \nLimitation on Use of Funds with Respect to Certification of Certain Flights by the Russian \nFederation under the Treaty on Open Skies:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1222, \nwhich would place limitations on the use of funds for the United States to exercise its rights \nunder the treaty to authorize or permit a certification of new Russian aircraft or sensors used for \nOpen Skies Treaty observation missions.  This limitation would infringe on the ability of the \nUnited States to implement its rights and obligations under the Treaty.  A prohibition on U.S. \nparticipation in certification procedures would prevent the United States from reviewing, \nexamining, or raising concerns regarding a proposed Russian aircraft or sensor, but would have \nno bearing on the right of other States Parties to certify a Russian aircraft and its sensors, which \nwould be permitted to fly in observation missions over the territories of all States Parties, \nincluding the United States.    \n \nRetention of Missile Silos:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1634, which would \nrequire the Secretary of Defense to preserve each intercontinental ballistic missile silo that \ncontains a deployed missile as of the date of the enactment of this Act in at least a warm status.  \nThis section would impinge on the President\u2019s authority to determine the appropriate force \nstructure to meet nuclear deterrence requirements, to determine the number of strategic delivery \n3  vehicles needed to meet national security requirements, and to implement changes in those \nforces.  While it is the President\u2019s determination that 50 of the current 450 Minuteman III silos \nwill remain in a non-deployed\u2014warm\u2014status, this provision would tie the hands of all \npresidents with respect to force structure through February 5, 2021.  Moreover, as the \nDepartment currently plans to perform routine testing and maintenance on some silos, which \nwould temporarily isolate them from the interconnected and redundant command and control \nsystem of the missile field during overhaul, the provision as drafted could prevent the \nDepartment from conducting this necessary testing and maintenance.  \n \nMissile Defense of Allies and Missile Defense Cooperation:  The Administration strongly objects \nto section 1641, which would require deployment of the Aegis Ashore site in Poland no later than \n2016 and of short-range air and missile defense capability to Poland no later than December \n2014.  Accelerating the deployment of the Aegis Ashore site by two years would impose large \ncosts on, and risk to, other Navy programs and likely would not change Russia\u2019s security \ncalculation in Europe.  Similarly, deploying short-range air and missile defense capability to \nPoland would limit the ability of the United States to meet its worldwide operational missile \ndefense requirements.  The Administration also objects to sections 1223 and 1224, which would \ninfringe on the President\u2019s ability to conduct foreign policy. \n \nEast Coast Missile Site Planning and Design:  The Administration strongly objects to the \nauthorization in section 4601 of $20 million in FY 2015 for planning and design of an east coast \nmissile field.  The authorization is premature and potentially wasteful. \n \nCooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) and Security Cooperation with Russia:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 1303, which would prohibit the obligation or expenditure of FY 2015 \nfunds for CTR activities in the Russian Federation until the Secretary of Defense makes certain \ncertifications, and strongly objects to sections 3120 and 3121, which would place restrictions on \nthe use of funds by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) for any contact, \ncooperation, or transfer of technology between the United States and the Russian Federation and \non defense nuclear nonproliferation cooperation activities at certain Russian defense sites.  \nNuclear security cooperation with the Russian Federation is in the U.S. national interest.  \nCooperation with Russia remains an essential element to the global effort to address the threat \nposed by nuclear terrorism.  Critical bilateral nuclear nonproliferation activities are continuing in \na number of key areas, and nuclear security is of paramount importance.  The blanket restriction \non the use of funds for \u201ccontact\u201d or \u201ccooperation\u201d between the United States and the Russian \nFederation unconstitutionally interferes with the President\u2019s constitutional authority to conduct \ndiplomacy.  The Administration similarly objects to section 1221, which would limit the use of \nfunds for military contact and cooperation between the United States and Russian Federation \nunless Russia fully complies with its obligations under the Conventional Armed Forces in \nEurope Treaty and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty, and withdraws its forces \nfrom Ukraine, or certain certifications are made.  In addition, section 1225, among other things, \npurports to make a definitive finding that the Russian Federation is in material breach of its \nobligations under the INF Treaty and requires the President to report to Congress on whether the \nUnited States should remain a party to the INF Treaty and other international agreements.  These \nprovisions would hamper the President\u2019s ability to execute foreign policy.  \n \nIran Nuclear Negotiations:  The Administration has concerns with the Sense of Congress \nlanguage on Iran in section 1264 or similar provisions purporting to set conditions on \n4  negotiations.  Preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon has been a top priority for the \nAdministration toward which it has worked diligently with Congress and our international \npartners.  The Administration appreciates Congress\u2019 important contributions to strengthening \nsanctions, which assisted in our ability to conclude a Joint Plan of Action and to pursue \nnegotiations on a comprehensive solution.  The International Atomic Energy Agency has \nassessed that under the Joint Plan of Action, Iran has taken specific and verifiable actions that \nhave halted the progress of Iran\u2019s nuclear program and rolled it back in key respects.  The \nongoing P5+1 negotiations are the best opportunity to peacefully achieve the goal of preventing \nIran from getting a nuclear weapon.  By spelling out conditions for a final resolution before the \nconclusion of the negotiations, the bill undermines that vital effort.  The Administration is fully \ncommitted to continuing to brief and consult closely with Congress so that the U.S. Government \nspeaks with one voice and does not undermine our negotiators\u2019 efforts to achieve a strong deal \nthat will protect our interests, our partners, and the international community.   \n \nAlternative Fuels:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 314, 315, 316, and 317, which \nwould impede DOD\u2019s use of alternative fuels.  Sections 316 and 317 would inhibit development \nof a diverse, cost-competitive energy supply that enhances American energy security.  A diverse \napproach to energy security -- one that includes both conventional and new sources -- will \nprovide an enduring benefit for our economy and military capabilities.  Section 315 would be \nburdensome and impractical to implement.  DOD has made and will continue to make alternative \nfuels a regular and ongoing part of its logistics and operations. As refined products, alternative \nfuels are indistinguishable from conventional fuels.  Section 314, which would exempt DOD \nfrom section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, undercuts a law passed \nwith strong bipartisan support that provides an environmentally sound framework for the \ndevelopment of future alternative fuels.  \n \nDOD Management:  The Administration objects to section 903, which would establish the \nposition of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment (ASD(I&E)).  \nWhile this section would eliminate the discretionary position of the Deputy Under Secretary of \nDefense for Installations and Environment (DUSD(I&E)), as required by law, it would increase \nthe number of statutorily prescribed ASDs when DOD is working to streamline headquarters \nstructure and reduce spending.  The Administration also believes that its proposal to merge \nDUSD(I&E) and ASD(Operational Energy Plans and Program), and re-designate the office as the \nASD for Installations, Energy, and Environment, would build synergies between installations, \nenvironment, and energy functions and activities.  The Administration also objects to section \n907, which would reverse the Secretary of Defense\u2019s November 2013 decision to reorganize the \nOffice of Net Assessment.   \n \nResubmission of 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR):  The Administration objects to \nsection 1078, which would require DOD to resubmit a report on the QDR that was released to \nCongress in March 2014.  Given the broad scope of the 2014 QDR, resubmitting a report absent \ngreater certainty about the future fiscal and security environment would yield a similar result and \nwould not be a prudent use of DOD resources.  \n \nOperation and Maintenance Reductions:  The Administration objects to the $1.4 billion reduction \nof unobligated balances and the $817.5 million reduction for contract services.  The unobligated \nbalances and contract services reductions will be applied to the same readiness programs that the \nCongress is increasing.  Contract services fund critical readiness and depot maintenance \n5  programs, but also provide support for congressional special interest items, such as tuition \nassistance, facilities maintenance, audit readiness, ROTC and military family programs, as well \nas sexual assault and suicide prevention. \n \nAssessment and Limitation on Availability of Funds for Intelligence Activities and Programs of \nthe United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and Special Operations Forces \n(SOF):  The Administration objects to section 1611, which would limit the availability of 50 \npercent of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for FY \n2015 of USSOCOM Major Force Program-11 procurement, defense-wide, and research, \ndevelopment, testing, and evaluation, defense-wide, until the Secretary of Defense submits to \nCongress an assessment of the intelligence activities and programs of the SOF and USSOCOM.  \nDOD does not object to conducting such an assessment, but the hold on funding would disrupt \ninvestment in critical future counterterrorism capabilities.  This restriction would require \ndelaying or canceling procurement and development of critical counterterrorism capabilities \ndesigned to support SOF operators in the field in a timely manner. \n \nRefueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) of the U.S.S. George Washington (CVN 73):  The \nAdministration has concerns with the authorization to begin the RCOH of CVN 73 and section \n1024, which limits the obligation and expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated or \notherwise made available to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, until funds are obligated for \nthe planning of the RCOH of CVN 73.  Without assurance that sequestration will be addressed \nand that future budget levels will be sufficient to ensure that CVN 73 can be adequately operated, \nmaintained, crewed, and sustained in a balanced force structure that includes 11 carriers and 10 \nair wings, it would be unwise to fund efforts to conduct the RCOH in FY 2015, only to be forced \nto cancel it and inactivate CVN 73 in FY 2016 due to ongoing budget restrictions.   \n \nUnmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike System (UCLASS):  The \nAdministration objects to section 213, which would restrict all funding for the UCLASS Program \npending an additional requirements review, and to an authorization reduction in the bill of $203 \nmillion.  These reductions would increase total program cost and jeopardize the program\u2019s \ncontinued viability.  \n \nLittoral Combat Ship (LCS):  The Administration objects to funding reductions for the LCS.  The \ncuts leave the program with insufficient funds to procure three LCS in FY 2015, delaying the \ndelivery of much needed capability to the Fleet.  Deferring additional ships into FY 2016 would \ncompound the already significant challenges the Navy faces in funding the shipbuilding account \nin a fiscally constrained environment while increasing overall costs to the Navy and increasing \nrisk to the industrial base, including sub-tier suppliers. \n \nProhibition on Implementing Military Health System Modernization Study:  The Administration \nobjects to section 714.  The timelines imposed by the reporting requirements, along with the \nmandatory 120-day waiting period, would significantly delay the implementation of \nimprovements identified in the Military Health System Modernization Study.  This delay would \nadversely affect medical readiness and clinical proficiency to the detriment of our military \nmembers and their families. \n \nDirectors and Deputy Directors of the Army and Air National Guard:  The Administration \nobjects to section 512, which would alter the selection process for leadership of the Army and \n6  Air National Guards by allowing the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to recommend General \nOfficers to serve in those positions.  Although these recommendations would have to be made in \nconsultation with the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force, these National \nGuard positions are charged with representing their respective services and are critical to the \nability of the Service Secretaries concerned to execute their statutory responsibilities.  \nAdditionally, to ensure the appropriate civilian control of the military, the Service Secretaries \nshould retain the current authority to recommend officers for appointment to these positions. \n \nMilitary Land Withdrawals:  The Administration has concerns with various provisions relating to \nmilitary land withdrawals and transfers with respect to various military installations.  While the \ncurrent system of periodic legislative re-withdrawals is not particularly efficient and does not \nprovide for the optimum land management regime, the Administration is not prepared to support \ntransfers of such lands without careful consideration of the supporting legislative provisions.  \nThe Administration stands ready to consider measures and approaches to make the use of public \nlands for military needs more efficient. \n \nReducing the Force Structure at Lajes Air Force Base:  The Administration objects to section \n1048, which would prohibit the Secretary of the Air Force from reducing the force structure at \nLajes Air Force Base.  It is duplicative of section 341 of the FY 2014 National Defense \nAuthorization Act.  Because DOD is nearing completion of the section 341 requirements for \nLajes, duplicating and amplifying these requirements is unnecessarily onerous.  While the \nprovision overall is objectionable, the Administration notes that the Comptroller General \nlanguage impermissibly vests in an agent of Congress the power to exercise policy-making \ncontrol over the post-enactment decisions of executive officials.   \n \nDisposition of Weapons-Usable Plutonium:  The Administration strongly objects to section \n3117, which would require the Secretary of Energy to continue construction of the Mixed Oxide \nFuel Fabrication Facility.  The Administration\u2019s plan to move the facility into cold stand-by in \nFY 2015 while it continues to explore more cost effective alternatives will save taxpayers \nbillions of dollars while still maintaining the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to disposing of \nunneeded plutonium.  \n \nSecond Line of Defense (SLD) Funding Reduction:  The Administration strongly objects to the \nsignificant reduction of funds for SLD.  The Global Nuclear Detection Architecture integrates \nefforts across the U.S. Government to detect the movement of nuclear and radiological materials \nand the SLD program is a vital component of that architecture.  Abruptly removing SLD \ncapabilities would result in gaps in our defenses that cannot be filled by any other program.  In \naddition, SLD implements key parts of the President's nuclear security agenda and is reflected in \nthe Nuclear Security Summit process.  Recent information from the IAEA also demonstrates that \nthe demand for the expertise and programs in which SLD is the global leader is increasing as \nmore countries finalize their plans for developing peaceful nuclear technology. \nPlutonium Pit Production Capacity:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3114, which \nwould require the Secretary of Energy to accelerate pit production rates ahead of requirements. \nThe Administration is committed to meeting military requirements for plutonium pit production \ncapacity as set by the Nuclear Weapons Council.  This directed increase is inconsistent with \nplanned funding levels and would unnecessarily increase risk by requiring further trade-offs with \nother nuclear weapons programs.  The Administration believes the plan put forward in the FY \n7  2015 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan represents the best balance of programs to \nmaintain the deterrent and provide for a responsive infrastructure. \n \nPrototypes of Nuclear Weapons for Intelligence Purposes:  The Administration strongly objects \nto section 3111, which would direct the national security laboratory directors to develop a \nmultiyear plan and would require the Secretary of Energy to submit it to Congress without \nchanges.  The Secretary of Energy should review and approve the multiyear plan.  Approval and \npublication of such a plan should be done by the government. \n \nProduction of Nuclear Warhead for Long-Range Standoff Weapon:  The Administration objects \nto section 3116, which would require accelerating the Long Range Stand Off program to achieve \na first production unit by 2025.  Such an adjustment must be made through a deliberative process \nthat takes into account the full set of military requirements.  Accelerating the program would \nrequire increased funding through FY 2019 and significant cuts in other programs.   \n \nAuthorized NNSA Personnel Levels:  The Administration objects to section 3112, which would \nimpose unduly restrictive limits on NNSA\u2019s ability to recruit, hire, retain, and reshape its \nworkforce to meet its diverse missions by capping the staff at 1,650 full time employees.  The FY \n2015 request funds an appropriate level of staffing and reflects significant efficiencies.  NNSA \nhas achieved in federal staffing and support, including a staff reduction of 9.3 percent relative to \nFY 2012. \n \nDefense Environmental Cleanup:  The Administration objects to section 3102, which would \neliminate the authorization of appropriations for the contribution to the Uranium Enrichment \nDecontamination and Decommissioning Fund.  This funding is critical to the Administration\u2019s \nproposal to reauthorize the Fund to address the significant shortfall in resources allocated for \ncleanup of shutdown uranium enrichment plants that supported nuclear weapons production and \ncommercial power generation. \n \nDOE Nuclear Facilities Safety:  The Administration objects to section 3203, which would reduce \nthe authorized personnel strength of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board from 150 to 120 \nfull-time employees.  This provision would severely hamper the ability of the Board to provide \nexternal, independent oversight of DOE's defense nuclear facilities and compromise its core \nmission to protect workers and the public. \n \nA number of the bill's provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, including with respect \nto the President\u2019s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n8  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nDecember 10, 2014 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5806 \u2013 Supporting America\u2019s Charities Act \n(Rep. Camp, R-MI, and 4 cosponsors) \nThe Administration supports measures that enhance non-profits, philanthropic organizations, and \nfaith-based and other community organizations in their many roles, including as a safety net for \nthose most in need, an economic engine for job creation, a tool for environmental conservation \nthat encourages land protections for current and future generations, and an incubator of \ninnovation to foster solutions to some of the Nation\u2019s toughest challenges.  The President's \nBudget includes a number of proposals that would enhance and simplify charitable giving \nincentives for many individuals. \nHowever, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5806, which would \npermanently extend three current provisions that offer enhanced tax breaks for certain donations.  \nAs the Administration stated when strongly opposing similar legislation this past July, if this \nsame, unprecedented approach of making certain traditional tax extenders permanent without \noffsets were followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to \ndeficits over the next ten years, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the \nAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.  Earlier this year, House Republicans themselves passed \na budget resolution that required offsetting any tax extenders that were made permanent with \nother revenue measures. \nAs with other similar proposals, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the \ndeficit to continue tax breaks, while insisting on offsetting the proposed extension of emergency \nunemployment benefits and the discretionary funding increases for defense and non-defense \npriorities such as research and development in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.  House \nRepublicans also are making clear their priorities by rushing to make these tax cuts permanent \nwithout offsets even as the House Republican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 26 \nmillion working families and students by letting important improvements to the Earned Income \nTax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and education tax credits expire. \nThe Administration wants to work with the Congress to make progress on measures that \nstrengthen America\u2019s charitable sector.

Foxx, R-NC, and 23 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 803, the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in \nLifelong Skills (SKILLS) Act, as ordered reported by the House Education and the Workforce \nCommittee.  \n \nThis Nation should be doing everything it can to help people find a job or build their skills to \nadvance in their careers or to seek a new one.  Additionally, it is imperative that employers have \nthe skilled workforce they need.  The Administration is exploring opportunities to revisit how the \nFederal Government funds job training and employment services, including the possibility of \nreorganizing some existing programs that serve overlapping populations.  The Administration \nalready has advanced proposals in this area through its Budgets, including a universal displaced \nworker program to provide those who lose their jobs with a single set of core services.  \n \nHowever, any effort to streamline the current system must allow for sufficient funding to meet \nthe needs of workers and job-seekers, as well as adhere to certain core principles.  It must \nimprove services; provide easy one-stop access to those services, including for vulnerable \npopulations; reflect employer and regional economic needs; enhance accountability and \ntransparency; and promote continuous innovation and improvement.  \n \nWhile H.R. 803 takes some positive steps, the bill does not adhere to the Administration's key \nprinciples for reform.  The bill would eliminate, or allow the consolidation of, many targeted \nprograms, without providing the critical assistance needed by vulnerable populations such as \nveterans, low-income adults, youth, adults with literacy and English language needs, people with \ndisabilities, ex-offenders, and others with significant barriers to employment.  H.R. 803 would \nfreeze funding for the next seven years and would fail to support efforts to innovate and replicate \neffective approaches.   \n \nIt is important to make sure that policies improve, rather than hinder, job access.

Lucas, R-OK, and Rep. Peterson, D-MN)  \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1947, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk \nManagement Act of 2013.  The bill would reduce access to food assistance for struggling  \nfamilies and their children, does not contain sufficient commodity and crop insurance reforms, \nand does not provide funding for  renewable energy, which is an important source of jobs and \neconomic  growth in rural communities across the country.  \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes the harmful cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  \nProgram (SNAP), a cornerstone of our Nation's food assistance safety net.  The bill makes \nunacceptable deep cuts in SNAP, which could increase hunger among millions of Americans \nwho are struggling to make ends meet, including families with children and senior citizens.  The  \nAdministration believes that Congress should achieve significant budgetary savings to help \nreduce the deficit without creating hardship for vulnerable families \u2013  for example, by  reducing  \ncrop insurance subsidies.  Rather than reducing crop insurance subsidies by  $11.7 billion over 10 \nyears, as proposed in the  President\u2019s Budget, H.R. 1947 would increase reference prices for  \nfarmers by  roughly 45 percent and increase already  generous crop insurance subsidies at a cost \nof nearly $9 billion  over 10 years  to the  Nation\u2019s taxpayers.  \n \nThe Administration supports enactment of a multi-year Farm Bill that includes a long-term \nextension of disaster programs and promotes rural development, preserves a farm safety net, \nmaintains strong nutrition  programs, encourages the development of local and regional markets, \nenhances conservation, supports environmental stewardship, complies with our World Trade  \nOrganization commitments, advances agricultural research, and provides funding for  renewable \nenergy.  In addition, the Administration believes that crop insurance payments should be tied to \nthe Nation's soil conservation and wetland protection goals.  The legislation should also \ncontribute significantly to deficit reduction, with savings from reforms proposed in the  \nPresident's Budget.  \n \nConsistent with the President's Budget, the Administration looks forward to working  with the  \nCongress to achieve  crop insurance  and commodity  program savings not contained in H.R. 1947, \nwhile at the same time strengthening the farm safety net in times of need and supporting the next \ngeneration of  farmers.  The Administration also looks forward to working  with the Congress to \nstructure reporting  requirements to maximize and facilitate agricultural research without  creating  \nundue burdens.  The Administration believes that provisions that would create unneeded barriers \nfor agencies with regulatory  responsibilities in executing their missions should not be included in \na final bill.   Finally, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reform the P.L. 480 \nTitle  II  food aid program in order to provide food aid to starving people faster and feed millions \nof additional people per year at current funding levels.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 1947, his senior advisors would recommend that he  \nveto the bill.  \n \n* * * * * * *  \n \n \n \n \n2\n   ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n   \n \nOctober 16, 2013 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nSubstitute Amendment to H.R. 2775 \u2013 Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 \n(Sen.

The Senate budget enables critical investments in education, infrastructure, \ninnovation, and national security that support America's continued economic recovery and best \npositions Americans and our economy to compete in the future.          \nS. 1243 is consistent with the budget framework that passed the Senate and the President's Budget \nfor FY 2014.  The bill makes important investments in transportation infrastructure that will help to \nfix America's crumbling roads and bridges and upgrade and modernize the infrastructure that is so \nvital to the Nation's economic security and long-term growth.  The bill also recognizes how \nimportant housing is to a sense of security for the American people.  This bill continues to provide \ncritical housing assistance to America's families, supports economic development in local \ncommunities, and contributes to the Nation's ongoing housing recovery. \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill.   \n \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT)  \n \nTransportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.  The Administration \nstrongly supports the $550 million provided for TIGER Grants.  This competitive grant program is \ncritical in helping communities around the country leverage their own resources to complete critical \ntransportation projects.  \n \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) Operations.  The Administration supports the Committee's \nefforts to prioritize FAA Operations funding and provide funds at the requested level of $9.7 billion.  \nThis funding level will allow the agency to hire to keep pace with attrition in its aviation safety and \ncontroller workforce. \n \nFAA Facilities, Equipment, and NextGen.  The Administration strongly supports the Committee's \ncommitment to maintain legacy facilities and equipment while also investing in modernization of \nthe Nation's air traffic control system through NextGen.  The Senate Committee bill provides robust \nfunding for the NextGen initiative.  \n  National Railroad Passenger Corporations (Amtrak).  The Administration supports the \nCommittee's commitment to provide funding for grants to passenger rail.  The Committee bill \ncombines Amtrak operating and capital accounts into a single Amtrak grant program, allowing for \nincreased flexibility to address emergent needs. \n \nFederal Transit Administration (FTA) Capital Investment (New Starts) Grants.  The Administration \nsupports the Committee's commitment to investment in new public transit in cities across the \nNation.  By providing the requested level for Transit New Starts, the bill will enable FTA to fund all \nexisting New Starts grant agreements for projects currently under construction as well as support for \nthe new projects recommended in the Budget, including a Core Capacity program grant as \nauthorized in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). \n \nPipeline Safety.  The Administration strongly supports the funding provided for the Pipeline and \nHazardous Materials Administration, which will allow for more pipeline safety inspectors and State \ngrants to monitor and regulate the Nation's 2.6 million miles of privately owned and operated \npipelines. \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nCore Rental Assistance.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for HUD's core \nrental assistance programs, which provide affordable rental housing for millions of low-income \nfamilies.  The Administration urges the Congress to enact the full $20 billion request for the \nHousing Choice Voucher program in order to maximize assistance to families seeking decent, safe, \nand sanitary housing in the private rental market. \n \nChoice Neighborhoods.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for Choice \nNeighborhoods, and urges the Congress to provide the full $400 million request for this program.  \nChoice Neighborhoods provides critical support to revitalize distressed HUD-assisted housing and \nbuild ladders of opportunity for low-income families by improving economic development, creating \njobs, and helping residents access educational opportunities in surrounding communities.  \n \nHomeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the President's \nrequest for Homeless Assistance Grants, which funds a variety of intervention programs that serve \nhomeless and at-risk individuals and families, and urges Congress to provide the full $2.26 billion \nfor these grants.  At this level, HUD would be able to serve at least 26,000 additional persons who \nare homeless and at-risk of homelessness. \n \nCommunity Development Block Grants (CDBG).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \nsupport for CDBG, including $75 million for Integrated Planning and Investment Grants.  This \nfunding provides critical State and local resources for public improvements, infrastructure, \naffordable housing, and public services for low- to moderate-income families, and supports \nplanning efforts to help localities strategically invest those resources to achieve the greatest benefit \nfor citizens.  The Administration urges the Congress to also support the proposed Neighborhood \nStabilization Initiative to provide targeted assistance to neighborhoods still feeling the effects of the \nforeclosure crisis. \n \nHOME Investment Partnerships Program.

Republicans have had more than a \nyear to comprehensively fix the Nation's broken immigration system, but instead of working \ntoward a real, lasting solution, Republicans released patchwork legislation that will only put \nmore arbitrary and unrealistic demands on an already broken system.  H.R. 5230 could make the \nsituation worse, not better.  By setting arbitrary timelines for the processing of cases, this bill \ncould create backlogs that could ultimately shift resources away from priority public safety goals, \nlike deporting known criminals.  This bill will undercut due process for vulnerable children \nwhich could result in their removal to life threatening situations in foreign countries.  In addition, \nthe limited resources provided in H.R. 5230 are not designated as emergency, but rather come at \nthe expense of other Government functions. \n \nH.R. 5230 also fails to provide the necessary resources for the Department of Agriculture to \naddress imminent wildfire suppression and rehabilitation needs without resorting to damaging \ntransfers from other critical forest health and fire preparedness priorities.  It also does not include \nthe bipartisan proposal for a discretionary cap adjustment to provide funding certainty in the \nfuture for these needs.   \n \nH.R. 5230 does not include funding for the Department of Defense to support the Government of \nIsrael's request for critical missile defense needs. \n \nH.R. 5230 also waives important environmental protections for National Parks, National \nMonuments, and other public lands within 100 miles of the border for Customs and Border \nProtection activities. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5230, his senior advisors would recommend he veto \nthe bill.  \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to pass sensible and responsible legislation to address \nthese pressing needs.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n \nNovember 17, 2014 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n  H.R. 4012 \u2013 Secret Science Reform Act of 2014   \n(Rep.

The bill \nalso could prevent EPA from making crucial decisions, including those concerning the cleanup \nof contaminated sites, if the data supporting those decisions cannot, for legitimate reasons, be \nmade publicly available.  For example, some scientifically-important data is not made broadly \navailable in order to protect the privacy of test subjects or Confidential Business Information, \nand H.R. 4012 could prevent EPA from taking actions based on protected data.  In short, the bill \nwould undermine EPA\u2019s ability to protect the health of Americans, would impose expensive new \nmandates on EPA, and could impose substantial litigation costs on the Federal government.

This past spring, a broad bipartisan \nmajority of the House passed a bill that answered the President\u2019s call.  S. 2685 carefully builds \non the good work done in the House and has won the support of privacy and civil liberties \nadvocates and the private sector, including significant members of the technology \ncommunity.

This legislation undermines the existing right to \nhard-earned overtime pay, on which many working families rely to make ends meet, while \nmisrepresenting itself as a workplace flexibility measure that gives power to employees over \ntheir own schedules.  If the President were presented with this legislation in its current form, his \nsenior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \nH.R. 1406 would not prevent employers from cutting the overtime hours and reducing the \ntake-home pay of employees who currently have the right to overtime compensation.  The \nlegislation does not provide sufficient protections for employees who may not want to receive \ncompensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay. \n  \nThe proposed legislation also does not guarantee that workers will be able to use the time they \nhave earned when they choose.  Instead, H.R. 1406 could be read to provide employers broad \ndiscretion to deny requests to use compensatory time off if it would unduly disrupt their \noperations.  Additionally, the bill fails to specify what remedy would be available to those \nemployees who are denied their requests.   \n \nFinally, the bill does not fully protect a worker's right to receive monetary compensation for \ncompensatory time they may have accrued but not used.  The bill allows workers to accrue as \nmany as 160 hours \u2013 20 full days \u2013 but does not protect that accrued time if employers go out of \nbusiness or declare bankruptcy. \n \nThe Administration continues to support and promote fair and flexible workplace policies that \nenhance worker productivity and simultaneously benefit employees and employers alike.  We \nlook forward to working with the Congress on proposals that will truly enhance \nworker-controlled flexibility and that ensure our American workplaces meet the needs of \nworking families and a 21st Century workforce.  This includes support in the President's Budget \nfor state paid leave programs that do not force workers to choose between taking time off for \nfamily needs and receiving income, or even risk losing their jobs.

Making \nthis credit permanent will increase its effectiveness, since it will allow businesses to make \ninvestments and create jobs today confident that they will continue to benefit from the credit in \nthe future.  Moreover, four-fifths of the R&D credit is attributable to salaries of U.S. workers \nperforming U.S.-based research\u2014meaning that the credit helps create high-skilled jobs, as well \nas encouraging new innovations and future productivity. \n \nHowever, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4438, which would \npermanently extend and expand the R&D credit without offsetting the cost, adding to long-run \ndeficits.   \n \nBy making the R&D credit permanent without offsets, H.R. 4438 would add $156 billion to the \ndeficit over the next 10 years.  Moreover, if this same, unprecedented approach of making major \ntraditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional tax \nextenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits, wiping out most of the deficit reduction \nachieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.  Last month, House Republicans \nthemselves passed a budget resolution that required offsetting any tax extenders that were made \npermanent with other revenue measures. \n \nThe deficit increase in H.R. 4438 is more than fifteen times the cost of the proposed extension of \nemergency unemployment benefits, which Republicans are insisting be offset, and more than \ndouble the discretionary funding increases for defense and non-defense priorities such as research \nand development in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which were offset.  House Republicans \nalso are making clear their priorities by rushing to make business tax cuts permanent without \noffsets even as the House Republican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 25 million \nworking families and students by letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax \nCredit, Child Tax Credit, and education tax credits expire.   \n \nThe Administration wants to work with Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen \nthe economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax reform.  \nHowever, making traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets represents the wrong \napproach.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4438, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nOctober 12, 2013 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 1569 \u2013 Default Prevention Act of 2013  \n(Sen.

Specifically, this bill would favor an arbitrary standard for leasing in open areas over \nleasing on the basis of greatest resource potential; limit the public's opportunity to engage in \ndecisions about the use of public lands; raise the potential for costly litigation, protests, and \ndelays; strip the ability of the Department of the Interior to issue permits to drill based on \nimportant environmental reviews, clearances and tribal consultation; and curtail the use of public \nlands for other uses like hunting, fishing, and recreation.

Additionally, the \nbill would prevent assessment of whether modifications to border-crossing pipelines or electric \ntransmission facilities are in the national interest, which is provided for through the current \nprocess.  \n \nH.R. 3301 would also raise serious trade implications by eliminating the current statutory \nrequirement that the Department of Energy authorize orders for exports and imports of natural \ngas to and from Canada and Mexico.   \n \nBecause H.R. 3301 would circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining \nwhether cross-border pipelines and electric transmission facilities are in the national interest by \nremoving the Presidential permitting requirement, if presented to the President, his senior \nadvisors would recommend that he veto this bill.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \n                                                                                                 March 4, 2014 \n                              (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4118 \u2013 SIMPLE Fairness Act \n(Rep. Jenkins, R-Kansas, and 8 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4118, the Suspending the Individual \nMandate Penalty Equals Fairness Act, because the bill would increase health insurance \npremiums, decrease tax credits, increase the number of uninsured, and shift costs to businesses, \nworkers, and health care providers.  Rather than attempting once again to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act, which the House has tried to do approximately 50 times, it is time for the Congress to \nstop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater \neconomic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to get into the \nmiddle class. \n \nThe Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care.  Every day, \nthousands of Americans are signing up for insurance, and four million have signed up so far.  \nBecause of the Affordable Care Act, Americans who have previously been denied coverage due \nto a pre-existing medical condition now have access to coverage.  Additionally, the law helps \nmillions of Americans stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26, and provides access to free \npreventive care like cancer screenings that catch illness early on.   \n \nH.R. 4118 would repeal the provision in the coming year that applies only to those Americans \nwho can afford to purchase health insurance but decide not to do so.  In fact, the Affordable Care \nAct already includes affordability and special-circumstances exceptions for Americans who \ncannot afford insurance.  And the individual shared responsibility provision is essential to \nensuring that the 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can get coverage without \nbeing charged more or losing coverage when they get sick. Repealing this part of the law would \nalso result in higher premiums for those who remain insured, fewer premium tax credits for \nmiddle-income families, and increased cost-shifting of uncompensated care to health care \nproviders, workers, and businesses. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4118, he would veto it. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \n                    July 10, 2014 \n                    (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4718 -- Permanent Extension of Bonus Depreciation \n(Rep. Tiberi, R-Ohio, and 26 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4718, which would permanently \nextend \"bonus depreciation\" rules that allow corporations to speed up deductions for certain \ninvestments and thereby delay tax payments.  This provision was enacted in 2009 to provide \nshort-term stimulus to the economy, and it was never intended to be a permanent corporate \ngiveaway.  Moreover, H.R. 4718 includes no offsets and would add $287 billion to the deficit \nover the next 10 years, wiping out more than one third of the deficit reduction achieved by the \nAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.   \n  \nThe deficit increase in H.R. 4718 is more than twenty times the cost of the proposed extension of \nemergency unemployment benefits, which Republicans are insisting be offset, and more than \ntriple the discretionary funding increases for defense and non-defense priorities enacted in the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which were offset.  House Republicans also are making clear \ntheir priorities by rushing to make business tax cuts permanent without offsets even as the House \nRepublican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 26 million working families and students \nby letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and \neducation tax credits expire. \n  \nThe Administration wants to work with the Congress to make progress on measures that \nstrengthen the economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax \nreform.  However, making costly business tax cuts permanent without offsets represents the \nwrong approach.  \n  \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4718, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n   \nNovember 17, 2014 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \n  H.R. 1422 \u2013 EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2013   \n(Rep. Stewart, R-UT, and 21 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1422, which would affect the ability of EPA\u2019s \nScience Advisory Board (SAB) to form panels and perform its essential functions. The SAB, \nalong with other functions, reviews the quality and adequacy of certain scientific and technical \ninformation used by EPA or proposed as the basis for EPA regulations.  Therefore, it is \nimperative that the SAB be composed of the most knowledgeable scientific and technical experts \navailable.  The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which governs Federal advisory \ncommittees such as the SAB, provides for balanced panels and subcommittees that include \nexperts with diverse backgrounds who represent wide-ranging perspectives.  \n \nH.R. 1422 would negatively affect the appointment of experts and would weaken the scientific \nindependence and integrity of the SAB.  For example, the bill would impose a hiring quota for \nSAB members based on employment by a State, local, or tribal government as opposed to \nscientific expertise.  Further, it would prohibit a SAB member from participating in \u201cadvisory \nactivities that directly or indirectly involve review and evaluation of their own work.\u201d  \nDetermining the practical meaning of \u201cindirect\u201d involvement will be difficult and consequently \nproblematic to implement.  The provisions on appointment of experts to the SAB and various \nother requirements could preclude the nomination of scientists with significant expertise in their \nfields.   \n \nH.R. 1422 also would add burdensome requirements on the SAB with respect to solicitation of \nand response to public comments, above and beyond those imposed by FACA.  These new \nrequirements would saddle the SAB with workload that would impair its ability to carry out its \nmandate.  Further, H.R. 1422 would add an unnecessary, burdensome, and costly layer of \nrequirements for hazard and risk assessments without defining the scope of these requirements \nand absent recognition that many high profile assessments already are reviewed by the SAB.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 1422, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nApril 23, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1549 \u2013 The Helping Sick Americans Now Act  \n (Rep. Pitts, R-PA, and 16 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports policies that ensure all Americans with pre-existing \nconditions have access to affordable health care.  This is why the Affordable Care Act banned \nmost insurance companies from charging more or excluding coverage based on an individual's \npre-existing condition starting in 2014.  It is also why the health care law adopted a temporary \nhigh-risk pool plan, called the Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP), to provide a bridge \nto the new system starting in 2014.  PCIP has provided coverage to Americans who are \nuninsured and would otherwise be denied health coverage because of their health condition.  \nBecause of the high cost of care for the over 100,000 people enrolled in PCIP, HHS made a \nnumber of adjustments to the program, like negotiating lower provider payment rates, to ensure \nresponsible management of the $5 billion provided by the Congress.  To ensure sufficient \nfunding through the year for current enrollees, HHS suspended new enrollment in PCIP starting \nin February and March, 2013.   \n \nWhile the Administration would like to extend coverage to as many Americans as possible, \nrather than finding common ground on a funding source, this legislation effectively would repeal \npart of the Affordable Care Act.  The Affordable Care gives hard-working, middle-class families \nthe security they deserve.  The Affordable Care Act forces most insurance companies to play by \nthe rules, prohibiting them from dropping your coverage if you get sick, billing you into \nbankruptcy through annual or lifetime limits, and, soon, discriminating against anyone with a \npre-existing condition. \n \nThe Affordable Care Act created the Prevention and Public Health Fund to help prevent disease, \ndetect it early, and manage conditions before they become severe.  The Fund supports critical \ninvestments such as tobacco use reduction, and programs to reduce health-care-associated \ninfections and the national burden of chronic disease, as well as helping to ensure Americans \nhave access to affordable coverage for preventive benefits.  By concentrating on the causes of \nchronic disease, the Fund helps more Americans stay healthy.  \n \nThe Fund has maintained high-priority activities to improve health outcomes.  This legislation \neffectively would eliminate the Prevention Fund for the next three years, forcing an end to key \nprevention programs it supports. \n \nIf the President is presented with legislation that would effectively repeal the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund for 2013 through 2016, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto it. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nMarch 5, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 933 \u2013 Department of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Full-\nYear Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration is deeply concerned about the impact of H.R. 933, making appropriations for \nthe Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other departments and \nagencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes, and is committed \nto working with the Congress to address these concerns in a way that strengthens the middle \nclass and helps to grow the economy.   \n \nWhile the Administration is pleased to see that H.R. 933 is consistent with the mutually agreed \nupon budget framework in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), the bill raises concerns about \nthe Government's ability to protect consumers, avoid deep cuts in critical services that families \ndepend on, and implement critical domestic priorities such as access to quality and affordable \nhealth care.  Furthermore, while the legislation includes the Department of Defense and the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies fiscal year 2013 bills, the \nremainder of Federal agencies are left to operate at last year's level, which will impede their \nability to provide services to Americans and efficiently allocate funding to key programs \nincluding those in infrastructure, clean energy, education, and research and development. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to refine the legislation to \naddress these concerns.  As the Congress considers this bill, the Administration will continue to \npress the Congress to eliminate the automatic and arbitrary cuts to current funding levels \nimposed by the Joint Committee sequestration, which will harm middle class and working \nAmericans while costing the Nation's economy hundreds of thousands of jobs.  The President \ncontinues to work to replace sequestration with a larger, balanced deficit reduction agreement \nthat strengthens the middle class by accelerating job creation and growth while coupling serious \nentitlement reform that strengthens these critical programs with tax reform that raises revenue by \nclosing tax loopholes for the wealthiest Americans.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \nJune 11, 2013 \n \n(House Rules)\nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nH.R. 1960 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2014 \n(Rep. McKeon, R-CA, and 1 cosponsor) \n \nThe Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee's continued support of our \nnational defense and supports a number of the provisions in H.R. 1960, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.  In particular, the Administration appreciates the support of \nthe Committee for authorities that assist the warfighter in operating in unconventional and irregular \nwarfare and countering unconventional threats, support capacity building efforts with foreign \nmilitary forces, support contingency or stability operations, remove restrictions on the use of U.S. \nand Japanese funding for the activities related to the realignment of Marines to the Asia-Pacific \nregion, as well its support for programs that would improve the health and well-being of the force.  \nThe Administration appreciates the support of the Congress in working to eliminate the threat that \nsexual assault in the military presents to our Service members and our national security.  The \nAdministration will continue to work with Congress to identify actions that can be taken to address \nthis urgent priority that is essential to the health and readiness of our Armed Forces.  \n \nWhile there are a number of areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration has serious \nconcerns with certain provisions.  Several provisions would constrain the ability of the Armed \nForces to align military capabilities and force structure with the President's strategy, impede the \nability of the Secretary of Defense to reduce overhead and make programs more efficient, and \nconstrain efforts to implement the U.S. strategy for Afghanistan.  In this time of fiscal pressure, we \nmust ensure that scarce resources are directed to the highest priorities for national security.  \nMoreover, H.R. 1960 assumes adoption of the House Budget Resolution framework, which would \nhurt our economy and require draconian cuts to middle-class priorities.  These cuts could result in \nhundreds of thousands of low-income children losing access to Head Start programs, tens of \nthousands of children with disabilities losing Federal funding for their special education teachers \nand aides, thousands of Federal agents who can't enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or \napprehend fugitives, and thousands of scientists without medical grants, which would slow research \nthat could lead to new treatments and cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, and hurt \nAmerica's economic competitiveness.  As the Administration indicated previously, the President's \nsenior advisors would recommend vetoing any appropriations legislation that implements the House \nRepublican Budget framework. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks \nforward to reviewing a classified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns on \nclassified programs.  However, if the bill is presented to the President for approval in its current \nform, the President's senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill. \n \nDetainee Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1032, 1033, 1034, and 1035, \nwhich unwisely and inappropriately interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to manage  detainees in a time of armed conflict.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of \nthese and similar provisions in prior versions of this law and has reiterated his call on Congress to \nlift the restrictions, most recently in his address to the Nation at the National Defense University. \nSections 1032, 1033, and 1034 are substantially similar to provisions found in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 and to provisions found in previous years' defense \nappropriations bill and other legislation.  They would continue unwise funding restrictions that \nwould prohibit the construction or modification of a detention facility in the United States to house \nGuantanamo detainees, and would constrain our ability to transfer Guantanamo detainees, including \nthose who have already been designated for transfer to other countries.  Operating the facility at \nGuantanamo weakens our national security by wasting resources, damaging our relationships with \nkey allies, and reinforcing propaganda used by al-Qaeda to attack the United States and our \nvalues.  Prohibiting the transfer of detainees to the United States and restricting the transfer of \ndetainees to the custody or effective control of foreign countries or entities in the context of an \nongoing armed conflict may interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the \nappropriate disposition of detainees and to make important foreign policy and national security \ndeterminations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers should occur.  In \naddition, the restrictions in sections 1033 and 1034 would, in certain circumstances, violate \nconstitutional separation of powers principles.  They are also completely unnecessary.  Even in the \nabsence of these restrictions, the Administration has worked \u2013 and in the future would work \u2013 to \nensure that any country receiving a detainee would take appropriate security and treatment measures \nif any detainee is transferred. \nSection 1035 purports to require the Secretary of Defense to publicly release unclassified \nsummaries containing information about detainees at Parwan determined to represent an enduring \nsecurity threat to the United States no later than 120 days after the bill's enactment.  This provision \nwould intrude on the President's constitutional authority to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive \nnational security information.  The Administration urges that the provision be deleted or revised to \nmake clear that public disclosure of this information is encouraged, but not mandatory. \nNew START Treaty Implementation Reductions and Nuclear Employment Strategy:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to sections 1052 and 1054(a)(2) and (b), section 1053's requirement \nthat U.S. aircraft basing reductions be contingent on similar Russian reductions, and the reduction in \nauthorization of funds associated with New START Treaty activities in sections 4101 and 4301.  \nAll of these provisions would impinge on the President's ability to implement the New START \nTreaty and to set U.S. nuclear weapons policy.  In particular, section 1054(a)(2) would purport to \nrestrict the President's constitutional authority to negotiate international agreements, including sole \nexecutive agreements for arms reduction, and section 1054(b) would impinge on the President's \nauthority to determine the number of strategic delivery vehicles needed to meet national security \nrequirements and implement changes in those forces as appropriate.  Sections 1052 and 1053 would \nlimit the President's authority to determine appropriate force structure to meet nuclear deterrence \nrequirements and to set nuclear employment policy \u2013 authority exercised by every president in the \nnuclear age.   \n \nMissile Defense:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 232 and 233.  Section 232, which \nwould require the Missile Defense Agency to construct and make operational an additional \nhomeland defense site, ignores possible alternatives, ignores fiscal constraints, presumes a validated \nmilitary requirement for a third U.S.-based missile defense site when none exists, and is at odds \nwith Congressional direction to complete the evaluation and environmental impact assessment \nrequired by section 227 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.  Section \n2  233, which would limit the President's authority to determine military requirements in East Asia and \naround the globe and to deploy U.S. forces accordingly, precludes the best military advice of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, ignores the high-demand/low-density nature of our inventory of missile \ndefense assets, especially given the current budget environment and resulting force levels, and \nundermines the ability to utilize flexible, adaptable, and relocatable capabilities that can be surged \nto defend U.S. interests and allies in other regions in times of crisis or conflict.   \n \nThe Administration also strongly objects to sections 238 and 1253.  Section 238 would require the \nPresident to use the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Military Common-Funded \nResource process to seek to fund the U.S. national contribution to NATO missile defense, which is \ncontrary to NATO Alliance processes, contrary to longstanding NATO Alliance principles, and \ncontrary to bilateral U.S. missile defense agreements with the Governments of Turkey, Romania, \nand Poland.  Section 1253 would prohibit funds made available for FY 2014 or thereafter from \nbeing used to implement any executive agreement relating to the missile defense capabilities of the \nUnited States with a country unless the United States and that country have a treaty of alliance, a \nsecurity guarantee, or a specific treaty or legislation for such activities.  This restriction would \nimpinge on the President's authority to conduct foreign policy and implement agreements that do \nnot otherwise limit U.S. missile defense capabilities.   \n \nOverseas Contingency Operations (OCO):  The Administration strongly objects to the provision of \nover $5 billion in unrequested OCO funding in the bill.  The President's Budget for FY 2014 fully \nfunds OCO requirements. \n \nTRICARE Fees and Co-Payments:  The Administration believes that military retirees deserve an \nexcellent, sustainable health care benefit.  For this reason, the Administration strongly supports its \nrequested TRICARE fee initiative that seeks to control the spiraling health care costs of the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) while keeping retired beneficiaries' share of these costs well below \nthe levels experienced when the TRICARE program was implemented in the mid-1990s.  The \nprojected FY 2014 TRICARE savings of $902 million and $9.3 billion through FY 2018 are \nessential for DOD to successfully address rising personnel costs.  DOD needs these savings to \nbalance and maintain investments for key defense priorities, especially amidst significant fiscal \nchallenges posed by statutory spending caps.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to \nsupport the proposed TRICARE fee initiative. \n \nMilitary Pay:  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to include the Administration's \nproposal to slow the military pay raise growth to 1 percent in FY 2014.  Consistent with the views \nof the uniformed military leadership, the Budget requests a 1.0 percent increase to basic pay, a 4.2 \npercent increase in the Basic Allowance for Housing, and a 3.4 percent increase in Basic Allowance \nfor Subsistence.  This total compensation level recognizes the sacrifices made by the men and \nwomen in our Armed Forces, while adhering to the current budget constraints faced by DOD.  The \nhigher pay raise provided by this bill would cost an additional $0.6 billion in FY 2014 and $3.5 \nbillion from FY 2014 to FY 2018.  As these costs are not offset, deeper reductions to troop levels as \nwell as readiness and modernization accounts would be needed at a time when statutory spending \ncaps require defense reductions. \n \nPermanent Active Duty Minimum End Strength Level for the Army:  The Administration strongly \nrecommends deletion of section 402, which would establish a new minimum active duty Army end \nstrength of 520,000 as of September 30, 2014.  This new minimum level restricts the Army from \nadjusting end strength to maintain a deliberate and synchronized drawdown plan that maintains \n3  operational readiness and accounts for the impact of sequestration across all programs, not just \nmilitary personnel. \n \nExpansion and Implementation of Protection of Rights of Conscience of Members of the Armed \nForces and Chaplains of Such Members:  The Administration strongly objects to section 530, which \nwould require the Armed Forces to accommodate, except in cases of military necessity, \"actions and \nspeech\" reflecting the \"conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs of the member.\"  By \nlimiting the discretion of commanders to address potentially problematic speech and actions within \ntheir units, this provision would have a significant adverse effect on good order, discipline, morale, \nand mission accomplishment. \n \nBase Realignment and Closure (BRAC):  The Administration strongly objects to section 2711, \nwhich would prohibit DOD from spending any funds to \"propose, plan for, or execute\" an \nadditional BRAC round.  This impinges on Executive Branch prerogatives to plan for contingencies \nor make other needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The \nAdministration urges the Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which would \nallow DOD to rightsize its infrastructure as required to meet the fiscal limitation of statutory \nspending caps, while providing important assistance to affected communities.  Without \nauthorization for a new round of BRAC, DOD may not properly align the military's infrastructure \nwith the needs of our evolving force structure, which is critical to ensuring that limited resources are \navailable for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security. \n \nLimitation on Availability of Funds for Certain Authorities for Afghanistan:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 1224, which would prohibit the use of the majority of security and \ncivilian assistance funds for Afghanistan until the Secretary of Defense certifies that a bilateral \nsecurity agreement with Afghanistan has been signed and meets conditions stipulated in section \n1224.  This provision would hamper the President's ability to enter into an executive agreement with \na foreign country, by decreasing U.S. negotiating leverage with the Afghan Government, and sends \na counter-productive message to our allies and the Afghan people. \nLimitations on Retirement of Weapon Systems:  The Administration objects to section 132, which \nwould prohibit the cancellation or modification of the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program \n(AMP), and to the authorization of $47 million for Low Rate Initial Production kit procurement for \nthe C-130 AMP.  Retaining AMP would cost $1.6 billion within the Future Years Defense Program \n(FYDP) and an additional $1.1 billion after the FYDP to complete.  DOD plans to cancel the C-130 \nAMP in part because there is a less expensive solution.  DOD is conducting an independent cost \nbenefit analysis, pursuant to section 143 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013, \nand it would be premature to reinstate AMP before the study is complete.  Also, the Administration \nobjects to section 1022, which restricts DoD from obligating or expending any FY 2014 funds for \nthe retirement, preparation of retirement, inactivation, or storage of a cruiser or dock landing ship.  \nAlthough the Congress has provided some near-term funding to operate and modernize these ships, \nsuch a restriction is unaffordable over the long term.  \nWeapon Systems Development:  The Administration strongly objects to section 218, which would \nrequire the Secretary of the Air Force to develop a follow-on air-launched cruise missile to the \nAGM-86 that achieves initial operating capability for both conventional and nuclear missions by \n2030.  There is currently no requirement or funding in the Long Range Standoff Weapon program, \nto develop and field a conventional variant.  The Administration also strongly objects to section \n3121, which would require the evaluation of three separate life extension program (LEP) options \n4  during the W78/88-1 Phase 6.2/2A Feasibility and Cost Study.  The current study scope will inform \na cost/risk/benefit decision on a warhead with an interoperable nuclear explosive package that can \nbe used on multiple platforms.  Changing the study scope to include separate, full scope LEP \noptions for both the W78 and W88 would significantly delay completion of the feasibility study and \nincrease LEP costs. \n \nModifications to Annual Reports Regarding the Condition of the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 3132(b), which would direct \"appropriate officials\" (e.g., \nnational lab directors or the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command) to submit annual assessment \nletters regarding the condition of the nuclear weapons stockpile directly to the defense committees \nif the Administration does not submit the assessments by the deadline established by statute.  The \nAdministration strongly believes that the subordinate officials should not submit the assessment \nletters directly to the Congress. \n \nAlternative Fuels:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 316, 318, and 319, which would \nimpede DOD's use of alternative fuels.  Sections 318 and 319 would inhibit development of a \ndiverse, cost-competitive energy supply that enhances American energy security.  A diverse \napproach to energy security\u2014one that includes both conventional and new sources\u2014will provide \nan enduring benefit for our economy and military capabilities.  Section 316, which would exempt \nDOD from section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, undercuts a law \npassed with strong bipartisan support that provides an environmentally sound framework for the \ndevelopment of future alternative fuels. \n \nNuclear Treaty Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1254, which would prohibit \nthe obligation or expenditure of FY 2014 funds for Threat Reduction Engagement activities until \nthe President certifies to the Congress that no state party to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty has undertaken nuclear weapons test activities in FY 2013 that are inconsistent with the \nUnited States interpretations regarding obligations under such Treaty.  The Administration also \nobjects to section 1055, which would require the President to consult with the Congress and submit \na plan for engaging foreign countries that are found to be not in compliance with their treaty \nobligations.  Both provisions would hamper the President's ability to execute foreign policy. \n \nExtension of Authority for Task Force for Business and Stability Operations in Afghanistan:  The \nAdministration requests that the House include the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations \n(TFBSO) in Afghanistan proposal, which would reauthorize the continuation of key projects in \nAfghanistan that bolster its economic stability.  Because many of these projects are conducted in \ndirect coordination and partnership with Afghan ministries, the abrupt cessation of TFBSO would \nerode trust the U.S. Government has built with the Government of Afghanistan. \n \nOffice of Security Cooperation in Iraq (OSC-I):  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \ncontinued support for the OSC-I.  However, section 1214 does not include the Administration's \nrequested language to authorize the OSC-I to conduct non-operational training activities in support \nof the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) personnel.  This authority is needed to continue \nsupporting the Government of Iraq's efforts to address Iraqi CTS capability gaps. \n \nJoint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF):  The Administration objects to the elimination of \nfunding request for JUONF.  This funding is critical to DOD's ability to quickly respond to urgent \noperational needs of Combatant Commanders.  Elimination of funding may delay fielding of \nimportant capabilities that help accomplish critical missions. \n5   \nBuilding Capacity of Foreign Military Forces:  The Administration appreciates the continued \nsupport of the Congress in section 1201 for building partnership capacity in foreign military and \nsecurity forces, but has concerns regarding provisions addressing theater security priorities and \nadvanced project formulation.  Section 1201 could undermine the speed and flexibility of section \n1206 authority.  We look forward to working with the Congress to integrate authorities with the \nimplementation of the recent Presidential policy on security sector assistance. \n \nIraqi and Afghan Special Immigrant Visas (SIV):  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of \nsection 1216, relating to authority for SIVs for certain Iraqi and Afghan allies.  The Administration \nsupports extension of these programs, but notes its concern that the periods of extension provided \nfor under section 1216 are not sufficient to meet projected program demand for either Iraq or \nAfghanistan.  Further, the much reduced number of visas for the Afghan SIV program \u2013 just 435 per \nyear \u2013 falls well short of expected demand, as evidenced by the volume of applications in FY 2013 \nto date.  We look forward to working with the Congress on these and other appropriate \nmodifications to section 1216 to ensure Iraqi and Afghan allies who have aided U.S. efforts in these \ncountries through their work, and who are experiencing an ongoing serious threat as a result, are \nable to apply for these visas. \n \nDefense Clandestine Service (DCS):  The Administration strongly objects to section 923, which \nwould restrict the implementation of the DCS.  The Administration remains committed to working \nwith the Congress to resolve its need for additional information on DCS but should not be limited to \ndefense priorities in the implementation of this important intelligence collection program. \n \nNational Intelligence Program Consolidation:  The Administration strongly objects to section 924 \nbecause the provision's prohibitions would impinge on the President's prerogatives to seek efficient \nbudget structures and unduly constrain the President in future budget decisions.  \n \nTransportation of Supplies for the United States by Aircraft Operated by United States Air \nCarriers:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1082, which would require Federal \nagencies, except DOD, to ship 50 percent of air cargo using aircraft that are owned by U.S. carriers \nand registered in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  This provision would not provide meaningful \nbenefit for CRAF participants but would reduce operational flexibility and increase costs for \nDefense and non-Defense agencies.  The Fly America Act already requires agencies to show \npreference for U.S.-flag carriers when soliciting contracts and to use those carriers where \nappropriate.  The provision would increase costs to the taxpayer while decreasing the effectiveness \nand reach of U.S. programs worldwide. \n \nUnrequested Funding:  In this fiscally constrained environment, the Administration objects to the \naddition of unnecessary funding, for example $168 million of unrequested increased authorization \nfor the M-1 Abrams tank, and to the authorization of $135.1 million of unrequested funding to \nprocure and to field additional Light Utility Helicopters.  The requirement for U.S. tanks will be \nfulfilled in December 2014, and the Army will not need to begin recapitalization of the Abrams tank \nfleet until the 2019 time frame. \n \nPurple Hearts for Fort Hood and Little Rock Victims:  The Administration objects to section 585, \nwhich would require the award of the Purple Heart to the service members killed or wounded in the \nattacks that occurred at Fort Hood, Texas, on November 5, 2009, and Little Rock, Arkansas on \nJune 1, 2009.  This provision is inconsistent with the award criteria for the Purple Heart. \n6   \nGovernance of Nuclear Security Enterprise:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 3122 \nand 3202.  These sections are premature with the ongoing work of the congressional governance \nadvisory panel.  The provisions to further expand the Kansas City Plant pilot could result in the \nunacceptable reduction of protection to workers, the public and security interests.  The \nAdministration is concerned that piece-meal exemptions for nuclear operations and possibly for \nother high-risk operations would serve to exacerbate inconsistencies and confusion, and add \ngovernance, management, and oversight uncertainty across the enterprise.  Section 3202 severely \nhampers the ability of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board to provide external, independent \noversight of DOE's defense nuclear facilities.  The provision to respond to a Secretarial request to \nperform a cost-benefit analysis of a Board recommendation is inconsistent with the underlying \nprecepts of adequate protection of public health and safety.  These provisions inappropriately \ndiminish the Secretary's role as operator and regulator of DOE's defense nuclear facilities and \ncompromise the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board's core mission to protect workers and the \npublic. \n \nScience, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic (STEM) programs:  The Administration objects \nto restoring funding for the STARBASE program and the National Defense Education PK-12 \nprogram in section 4201 and 4301.  This would perpetuate the Federal Government's fragmented \napproach to STEM education (more than 220 programs across 13 agencies) and is inconsistent with \nthe Administration's proposed reorganization of STEM programs, which would improve STEM \neducation quality and outcomes across the Federal Government. \n \nRequirement to Withhold DOD Assistance to Afghanistan Equivalent to Taxes Assessed by \nAfghanistan:  While the Administration agrees there is a significant opportunity to improve tax \ncollection in Afghanistan, section 1217 could be counterproductive.  This provision would also \nimpose an unreasonable administrative burden on agencies and could inadvertently undermine \ncapacity building efforts in Afghanistan. \n \nForeign Commercial Satellite Services:  The Administration objects to the language in section 1605 \nthat would prevent DOD from entering into contracts for satellite services that involve certain \ncovered foreign countries, except when the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director \nof National Intelligence, provides a waiver.  Such a constraint would limit DOD's flexibility to \nprovide timely support to the warfighter, who frequently requires expeditious access to satellite \ncommunications in areas with austere to non-existent communications infrastructure. \n \nGovernment-wide Limitation on Allowable Cost for Contractor Compensation:  The Administration \nappreciates the intent of section 813 to reform the cap establishing the reimbursement limit on \ncompensation for contractor employees.  However, the Administration urges adoption of its \nproposal that would tie the cap to the President's salary; this approach is more cost-effective and \nwould achieve a better result for taxpayers than the proposed approach of retaining a high cap based \non a flawed formula for most employees while allowing no reimbursement for the contractor's \nhighest paid executives.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on \nadoption of a fiscally responsible cap that ends excessive contractor payments in a fair and effective \nmanner. \n \nConstitutional Concerns:  A number of the bill's provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, \nincluding encroachment on the President's exclusive authorities related to international negotiations.  \n7  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n8  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n                      July 22, 2013 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2610 \u2014 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2014 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2610, making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other purposes.  The bill severely undermines \ncritical investments in economic and community development programs that drive local innovation, \nwhile also significantly reducing resources for public improvements, air traffic control \ninfrastructure, affordable housing, as well as public services for low- to moderate-income families.  \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2610, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill.  \n \nIn addition, enacting H.R. 2610, while adhering to the overall spending limits in the House Budget's \ntopline discretionary level for fiscal year (FY) 2014, would hurt our economy and require draconian \ncuts to middle-class priorities.  These cuts could result in hundreds of thousands of low-income \nchildren losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of children with disabilities losing \nFederal funding for their special education teachers and aides, thousands of Federal agents who \ncan't enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend fugitives, and thousands of scientists \nwithout medical grants, which would slow research that could lead to new treatments and cures for \ndiseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, and hurt America's economic competitiveness.  \n \nMore than three months have passed since the deadline for action and the Congress has yet to \nappoint conferees and agree on a budget resolution.  Prior to consideration of appropriations bills \nthe Congress should complete an appropriate framework for all the appropriations bills that supports \nour recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national \nsecurity for our economy to compete in the future.  As such, the President's senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto H.R. 2610 and any other legislation that implements the House Republican \nBudget framework. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill.   \n \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) \n \nTransportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.  The Administration \nstrongly opposes the elimination of funding for TIGER Grants.  This competitive grant program is \ncritical in helping communities around the country leverage their own resources to complete critical \ntransportation projects.  This program has been oversubscribed since its inception because TIGER \nGrants fund multimodal projects that are meritorious but can be difficult to fund within the current \nstove-piped financing structures.  Further, the $237 million rescission of FY 2013 funding included  in the Committee bill would dramatically disrupt DOT's execution of the ongoing TIGER grant-\nmaking process, and could necessitate the withdrawal of awards to current grantees. \n \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) Operations.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee's efforts to prioritize FAA Operations funding.  However, the Administration urges the \nCongress to fund FAA Operations at the level of the request of $9.7 billion, which allows the \nagency to hire in order to keep pace with attrition in its aviation safety and controller workforce. \n \nFAA Facilities, Equipment, and NextGen.  The Administration strongly opposes the $623 million \nreduction below the FY 2014 Budget request for the facilities and equipment account in the \nCommittee bill.  The funding level in the bill is roughly equal to the FY 2000 appropriated level.  \nThis reduction would significantly slow, if not terminate, several aspects of FAA's maintenance of \ncurrent facilities, equipment, and the modernization of the Nation's air traffic control system \nthrough NextGen.  The Committee bill specifically identifies reductions to critical infrastructure \nprograms, such as back-up electrical power systems, which are essential for maintaining reliable \nand safe control of airspace during commercial power outages like those experienced as a result of \nHurricane Sandy, and would require a nearly $400 million reduction to NextGen from the $1 billion \nrequested in the FY 2014 Budget. \n \nNational Railroad Passenger Corporations (Amtrak).  The Administration strongly opposes the \nfunding level included in the Committee bill for Amtrak.  The $350 million provided for Amtrak \noperations and $600 million for Amtrak Capital and Debt service do not sufficiently fund these \nimportant activities.  These reductions to Amtrak funding, which has long been underfunded, will \ncause significant delays in much needed capital investments and will result in deteriorated \nperformance, especially in the Northeast Corridor, where ridership is at an all-time high. \n \nHigh Speed Rail.  The Administration objects to the prohibition on funding for the California High \nSpeed Rail project.  The California High Speed Rail project, which was approved by California \nvoters as well as the California State Legislature, will spur job creation, decrease California's \nfootprint distance, reduce the amount of energy used per person, and will reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. \n \nFederal Transit Administration (FTA) Capital Investment (New Starts) Grants.  The Administration \nurges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $1.98 billion proposed in the FY 2014 \nBudget and to allow FTA to retain the $151 million in unallocated and unobligated funds for New \nStarts.  While the level in the Committee bill would provide funds for all existing grant agreements, \nit only provides funding for the new Small Starts projects recommended in the Budget, halting the \npipeline for any new construction on larger New Starts or Core Capacity projects. \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nCore Rental Assistance.  The Administration strongly opposes the $3.0 billion reduction to HUD's \ncore rental assistance programs:  Housing Choice Vouchers; Project-Based Rental Assistance; and \nPublic Housing.  The bill provides $33.8 billion, which is 8 percent below the FY 2014 Budget \nrequest.  The Committee bill would support approximately 125,000 fewer housing vouchers for \nvery low-income families, and would again require HUD to short-fund contracts with private \nhousing owners and reduce payments to public housing authorities. \n \nHomeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the FY 2014 \nBudget request for Homeless Assistance Grants, which funds a variety of intervention programs that \n2  serve homeless and at-risk individuals and families.  The Administration opposes the funding level \nprovided for Homeless Assistance Grants, which is $293 million, or 12 percent, below the FY 2014 \nBudget request.  At this level, HUD would not be able to renew all existing grants that provide \nhousing and shelter for the homeless, which would impact more than 86,000 homeless and formerly \nhomeless households, including many veterans. \n \nChoice Neighborhoods.  The Administration strongly objects to the $120 million rescission \nincluded in the bill for the Choice Neighborhoods program, and urges the Congress to provide the \n$400 million requested in the FY 2014 Budget.  Without this funding, public housing authorities \nand other local entities will have limited resources to support the revitalization of distressed HUD-\nassisted housing and to build ladders of opportunity for low-income families by improving \neconomic development, creating jobs, and helping residents access educational opportunities in the \nsurrounding neighborhoods.  \n \nCommunity Development Block Grants (CDBG) and Related Programs.  The Administration \nstrongly opposes the $1.7 billion funding level provided for the CDBG program, which would have \nsignificant impacts on State and local resources for public improvements, infrastructure, affordable \nhousing, and public services for low to moderate income families. The Administration also strongly \nopposes the lack of funding for Integrated Planning and Investment Grants and the new \nNeighborhood Stabilization Initiative.  The Administration urges the Congress to support these \nprograms at the requested levels to invest in regional and local planning efforts and to support \nneighborhoods still feeling the effects of the foreclosure crisis.  In addition, the Administration \nobjects to the level of funding for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which is $250 \nmillion below the Budget request.  The Administration urges the Congress to support this program \nat the requested level in order to increase the supply of affordable housing.  \n \nHousing Counseling.  The Administration opposes the reductions included in the Committee bill for \ncounseling programs in HUD and the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation of $39 million, or \n30 percent, below the Administration's request.  While the housing market has improved, there are \nstill many households facing the aftermath of the financial crisis and counseling is an important \nresource in helping households find affordable and stable housing.  \n \nHousing Opportunities for People Living with AIDS (HOPWA).  The Administration strongly \nopposes the $29 million reduction to HUD's program to provide housing for people living with \nHIV/AIDS.  The bill provides $303 million, which is 9 percent below the FY 2014 Budget request.  \nIn the face of the ongoing domestic HIV epidemic, this cut would result in nearly 5,000 people \nlosing housing services, severely affecting the health of homeless and marginally housed people \nliving with HIV/AIDS and increasing treatment costs. \n \nCivilian Pay Raise \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for Federal \ncivilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is \nneither sustainable nor desirable. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                       \n                      February 27, 2014 \n                                                                                                (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 899 \u2013 Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2013 \n(Rep. Foxx, R-North Carolina, and 4 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are tailored to advance statutory \ngoals in a manner that is efficient and cost-effective, and that minimizes uncertainty.  By layering \non additional, burdensome judicial review and other unnecessary changes to the regulatory \nprocess, H.R. 899, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2013, would \nintroduce needless uncertainty into agency decision-making and undermine the ability of \nagencies to provide critical public health and safety protections.  Accordingly, the Administration \nstrongly opposes House passage of H.R. 899. \n \nWhen a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and well-\nunderstood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction \nAct, and the Congressional Review Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been \nguided by executive orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  \nThese require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations upon a reasoned determination that \nthe benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory \nflexibility. \n \nThe President's regulatory approach has been consistent throughout his Administration.  We \ndon\u2019t have to choose between protecting the health, welfare, and safety of Americans and \npromoting economic growth, job creation, competitiveness, and innovation\u2014we can do both.  To \nthis end, Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased public \nparticipation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, and flexible regulatory approaches.  \nThrough executive orders and other presidential directives, agencies must ensure that they take \ninto account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.  And, through Executive \nOrders 13579 and 13610, the Administration has also taken important steps to promote \nsystematic retrospective review of regulations by all agencies, including encouraging \nindependent agencies to conduct such a review.  Collectively, these requirements promote \nflexible, cost-effective regulation. \n \nH.R. 899 would unnecessarily add to the already robust analytical and procedural requirements of \nthe rulemaking process.  In particular, H.R. 899 would create needless grounds for judicial \nreview, unduly slowing the regulatory process.  In addition, it would add layers of procedural \nsteps that would interfere with agency priority setting and compliance with statutory mandates. \n \nIf H.R. 899 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill.  \n*  *  *  *  *  *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n   \n \nOctober 8, 2013   \n(House)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.J.

The bill threatens the Federal government's \nlongstanding authority to manage property and claim proprietary rights for the benefit of Indian \ntribes and reserved Federal lands, and the broader public that depends on the proper management \nof public lands and resources.  It adversely affects DOI's and USDA's ability to manage water \nresources to:  (1) protect ongoing public lands uses and the environment; (2) allow for maximum \nbeneficial use of Federal water facilities; and (3) ensure adequate water is available for fisheries \nor threatened or endangered species. \n \nH.R. 3189 is overly broad and could have numerous unintended consequences.  For example, the \nbill could impede private water rights holders from entering into voluntary agreements with \nFederal agencies, which benefit State, Federal, and private water rights holders' interests and \nimprove water resource management. \n \nThe bill was introduced, in part, to address the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s ski area water rights clause \nproposal, which the Forest Service has changed in response to public feedback and will soon be \npublishing.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address any \nremaining concerns regarding the ski area water rights proposal after its publication and to \ndeveloping legislation that maintains the Federal government's interest in protecting public lands \nand waters, allows for the continuance of voluntary agreements between the Federal government \nand other water rights holders, and ensures adequate protection of the environment. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \nJune 10, 2014 \n                    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4453 \u2013 S Corporation Permanent Tax Relief Act of 2014 \n(Rep.

Just two months ago, House Republicans passed a \nbudget resolution that required offsetting any tax extenders that were made permanent with other \nrevenue measures.  This bill violates that standard. \n  \nWith this legislation, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the deficit to fund \ntax breaks for businesses, while insisting on offsetting the cost of measures that help middle-\nclass and working Americans, such as the proposed extension of emergency unemployment \nbenefits.

H.R. 4795 would prohibit the application of these science-\nbased updates for permitting major sources of air pollution until additional guidance and \nregulations are issued.  This arbitrary and unnecessary requirement could delay important public \nhealth protections.  \n \nH.R. 4795 could force EPA to issue detailed guidance and regulations that would impact the pre-\nconstruction permitting process without the benefit of collaborative input from States and \nregulated entities.  This could result in the issuance of regulations and guidance for applying the \nupdated NAAQS that are not tailored to the needs of the regulated entities, thus potentially \ncreating confusion and uncertainty for both States and industry.  Further, requiring EPA to \nproduce premature implementing guidance and regulations could increase legal vulnerabilities \nfor States and the Federal Government, adding additional uncertainty and further delaying the \nimportant health protections provided by the NAAQS.   \n \nFinally, this legislation could potentially lead to an inconsistent application of an updated \nNAAQS, which could result in some major sources of pollution having to achieve additional \nemissions reductions to make up for sources that become partially exempted.

Women should be able to \nmake their own choices about their bodies and their health care, and Government should not inject \nitself into decisions best made between a woman and her doctor.   \n \nForty  years ago, the  Supreme Court affirmed a woman's constitutional right to privacy, including  \nthe right to choose.

As \nthe economy continues to recover, and at a time when market interest rates are near historic lows, \nmore than seven million students who rely on these loans to finance postsecondary education should \nnot be burdened with additional college debt as they seek to graduate, launch a career or a business, \nstart a family, or buy a house.  \n \nCongress must act immediately to stop the imminent doubling of interest rates on student loans. The \nAdministration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 953, the Student Loan Affordability Act, \nbecause it meets the test of preventing student interest rates from doubling, saving seven million \nstudents nearly $1,000 per student.  Like the proposal in the President's FY 2014 Budget, this bill \ngives students the certainty of fixed interest rates, does not raise student loan interest rates for \ndeficit reduction, and supports low- and middle-income students who struggle most to afford a \ncollege education.  \n \nThe Administration remains committed to working with the Congress on a bipartisan approach to a \nlong-term, fiscally-sustainable solution that will help students and families afford higher education \nnow and in the future.

This \nlegislation complicates the regulatory process and creates two sets of standards for Federal \nagencies to follow to review projects -- one for \"construction projects\" and one for all other \nFederal actions, such as rulemakings or management plans.   \n \nThe Administration strongly rejects the legislation\u2019s premise that public input and responsible \nagency decision-making under current law hinders job creation.  The Administration believes \nthat H.R. 2641, if enacted, will lead to more confusion and delay, limit public participation in the \npermitting process, and ultimately hamper economic growth.

Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., the same coverage that \neveryone else is offered without interference by their employers. \n \nPreventive health services, when accessible and affordable, have the potential to prevent disease, \nmanage chronic illness, and save lives as well as dollars.  That is why the Affordable Care Act \nensures that Americans have coverage for preventive care like vaccines, cancer screenings, and \ncontraception that medical experts have concluded are critical to the Nation's health.  According \nto a recent analysis by the Department of Health and Human Services, an estimated 76 million \npeople have gained preventive services coverage since the law passed, and there are now an \nestimated 48.5 million women enrolled in private plans that are required to cover contraception \nwithout cost-sharing.  Contraception has significant health benefits, as documented by the \nindependent Institute of Medicine, and coverage removes cost as a barrier to its use.  One study \nfound that in 2013, the year the coverage requirement started, utilization increased and women \nsaved $483 million. \n \nHowever, the Supreme Court's rulings in Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. \nBurwell, allow some employers to now withhold contraception coverage from their employees \nbased on their own religious beliefs that their employees may not share.  The Administration \nbelieves that women should make personal health care decisions for themselves, rather than their \nemployers deciding for them. \n \nThis legislation would restore that right.  It would prevent owners of for-profit companies from \nasserting their personal religious views to deny their employees Federally-required health \nbenefits.  At the same time, it would preserve the regulatory exemption for religious \norganizations like houses of worship and an accommodation for eligible nonprofit religious \norganizations, like some charities, that have religious objections to contraception coverage.  This \nlegislation is consistent with the congressional intent in enacting the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act of 1993. \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2578 and remains committed to \nworking with the Congress to improve the affordability and accessibility of health care for all \nAmericans. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \nJune 10, 2014 \n(Senate) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nS. 2432 \u2013 Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act \n(Senator Warren, D-MA, and 43 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports passage of S. 2432, which would provide Americans with \nstudent loans the opportunity to refinance their loans at the lower interest rates available to \ncurrent students.  The legislation would benefit an estimated 25 million Americans and save a \ntypical borrower $2,000 over the life of his or her loan.  It would strengthen the economy by \noffering relief to Americans who are working hard to pay back their student loans and launch \ncareers, start families, or buy homes.  \n \nS. 2432 would offset the cost of its refinancing provisions by implementing the \u201cBuffett Rule,\u201d \nwhich would set a minimum tax rate for taxpayers with annual incomes over $1 million.

Rogers, R-Kentucky) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4923, making appropriations for \nenergy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2015, and for other purposes.  The bill significantly underfunds critical investments that develop \nAmerican energy sources to build a clean and secure energy future, support the emerging clean \nenergy technologies that create high-quality jobs, and enhance the Nation's economic \ncompetiveness.  The legislation also excessively restricts nonproliferation contracts with Russia \nand prevents the development of lower cost technologies for disposal of excess plutonium.  \nFurther, the bill includes objectionable environmental riders that would prevent the use of funds \nto address known deficiencies and regulatory uncertainties related to Clean Water Act regulations \nthat protect important aquatic resources while supporting economic development.  If the President \nwere presented with H.R. 4923, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations \nprocess that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding \nunnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include \nreconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and \nnational security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an \norderly appropriations process.  \n \nThe President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to \naccelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our \nnational security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same \ntime, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to \ndeliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.   \n \nThe President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan \nBudget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels.  However, \nthe levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation \nand are not sufficient\u2014either in FY 2015 or beyond\u2014to ensure the Nation is achieving its full \npotential.  For that reason, the Budget also includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and \nSecurity Initiative\u2014evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities\u2014that presents \nadditional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The \nOpportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would support a number of investments, including \nadditional applied research to accelerate the development and deployment of new energy \nefficiency and renewable energy technologies; a Race to the Top for Energy Efficiency and Grid  Modernization that would incentivize States to increase energy productivity and improve grid \nreliability and resilience; research into breakthrough technologies; and local planning assistance \nthat would help communities better prepare for the effects of climate change.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to fund critical programs that \npromote advances in clean energy, improve energy security, and enhance preparedness and \nresilience to climate change. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve the issues raised below during \nthe FY 2015 appropriations process. \n \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) \n \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Administration strongly objects to the \nfunding level of $1.8 billion provided in the bill for renewable energy, sustainable transportation, \nand energy efficiency programs, a $546 million reduction below the FY 2015 Budget request.  \nThis reduced funding level will stifle Federal investment in innovative clean energy research and \ndevelopment (R&D) at a time of significant global competition and progress.  The \nAdministration is also disappointed that the bill does not include transfer language to support \njoint efforts with the Navy and the Department of Agriculture to develop advanced drop-in \nbiofuels for military applications, a provision included in the FY 2014 enacted bill.  The \nAdministration appreciates the support for offshore wind technology demonstrations and for the \nClean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes.   \n \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration urges the Congress \nto fully fund the FY 2015 Budget request for ARPA-E at the level of $280 million.  The $45 \nmillion reduction from the FY 2015 Budget request would impact investments and delay \nimprovements in technologies that reduce energy\u2013related emissions, increase energy efficiency \nacross multiple economic sectors, and reduce energy imports.   \n \nEnvironmental Management.  The Administration appreciates support for cleanup activities \nfunded at $5.6 billion.   \n \nUranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund.  The Administration \nopposes the elimination of appropriations for the contribution to the Uranium Enrichment \nDecontamination and Decommissioning Fund.  The Administration's proposal to reauthorize the \nFund relies on this funding to address the significant shortfall in resources allocated for cleanup \nof shutdown uranium enrichment plants that supported nuclear weapons production and \ncommercial power generation.   \n \nOffice of Science.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2015 Budget \nrequest for the Office of Science.  The $40 million reduction from the FY 2015 Budget request \nwould reduce the number of grants to academic investigators and funding for staff at DOE \nlaboratories working on fundamental discovery science and research that underpins advances in \nclean energy.  This reduction would also affect access to world class facilities used by researchers \nfrom all sectors to conduct R&D.  The bill funds the international fusion project ITER, at a level \n$75 million above the FY 2015 Budget request.  In light of schedule delays and management \nreforms underway, the Administration is concerned that the U.S. contributions would outpace the \n2  readiness of the project.   \n \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee's support for the requested funding level for NNSA's Defense Nuclear \nNonproliferation and Weapons Activities programs.   \n \nNaval Reactors.  The Administration strongly objects to the $162 million reduction to the Naval \nReactors program from the FY 2015 Budget request.  Together with the $151 million reduction \nin the FY 2014 enacted bill, this reduction would continue to put the U.S. Navy's nuclear \npowered fleet at risk and would jeopardize the program's ability to train nuclear-qualified sailors. \nThe bill also continues to underfund the Spent Fuel Handling Facility Recapitalization Project in \nIdaho, risking the operational availability of aircraft carriers and submarines and increasing costs \nto the Department of Defense.   \n \nNuclear Nonproliferation Cooperation with Russia.  The Administration strongly objects to the \nlanguage in the bill that would prevent the use of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation \nappropriations for contracts with, or Federal assistance to, the Russian Federation.  \nNonproliferation cooperation with the Russian Federation is in the U.S. national interest and \nremains an essential element of the global effort to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism.  \nCritical bilateral nuclear nonproliferation activities are continuing in a number of key areas, such \nas improving physical protection and reducing insider threats at vulnerable Russian facilities.     \n \nDisposition of Weapons-Usable Plutonium.  The Administration strongly objects to language that \nwould require the Secretary of Energy to continue construction of the Mixed Oxide Fuel \nFabrication Facility.  The Administration plans to move the facility into cold stand-by in \nFY 2015 as it continues to explore the potential for more cost effective alternatives while \nmaintaining the U.S. Government's commitment to disposing of unneeded plutonium. \n \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve.  The Administration urges the Congress to strike the language in \nthe bill that prohibits the use of funding to acquire any petroleum product other than crude oil.  \nThis provision would hinder the future ability of the Executive Branch to respond effectively to \nchanging circumstances in national and international markets.   \n \nYucca Mountain.  The Administration objects to the DOE funding provided in the bill for Yucca \nMountain and is disappointed with the Committee's rejection of the practical solutions proposed \nin the Administration's nuclear waste strategy.  As reflected in the FY 2015 Budget request, this \nstrategy incorporates important and workable elements for a successful waste program, such as \nconsent-based siting, interim storage of waste, and program funding reforms that are essential to \nthe success of a Nuclear Waste Program.  Similarly, the Administration objects to funding \nprovided in the bill for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue adjudication of the \nYucca Mountain license application.  \n \nStatutory by Reference Provision.  The Administration urges the Congress to strike the language \nin the bill that incorporates the specific funding directions of the Committee bill report table into \nthe statute by reference.  Enactment of this provision would unduly limit the flexibility of the \nDepartment to manage programs and projects efficiently.   \n \n \n3  Corps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works (Corps) \n \nOverall Funding.  The bill provides $5.5 billion for the Corps civil works program, nearly $1 \nbillion above the FY 2015 Budget request.  The FY 2015 Budget focuses on investments that \nwould yield high economic and environmental returns or address a significant risk to public \nsafety.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fund the civil works program at the \nrequested level.  The funding increase for the civil works program is provided primarily by \ndecreases in other core priorities, including clean energy.  The Administration also urges the \nCongress to permit the Corps to commence new starts in FY 2015.  \n \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.  The Administration opposes the \nCommittee's provision of only $2 million for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army \nfor Civil Works, $3 million, or 60 percent below the FY 2014 enacted level and the FY 2015 \nBudget request.  Such a significant reduction would impede the ability of the Office of the \nAssistant Secretary to carry out its mission to oversee execution of the civil works program.  This \nwork is critical to ensuring efficient use of taxpayer dollars and effective management of the civil \nworks program in the development, management, and restoration of the Nation's water resources.  \n \nClean Water Act (CWA).  The Administration strongly objects to sections 105 and 106 of the bill, \nwhich would prevent the use of funds to address deficiencies and regulatory uncertainties related \nto CWA regulations designed to protect important aquatic resources while supporting economic \ndevelopment.  Section 106 in particular would impact an important, ongoing Administration \neffort to provide regulatory clarity on which water bodies are covered by the CWA, which has \nbeen the subject of two Supreme Court cases in which the Court indicated the need for greater \nclarity regarding the statute's scope.   \n \nFirearms Policy.  The Administration opposes section 107 of the bill, which prohibits the Corps \nfrom enforcing its ban on firearms on Corps lands.  If enacted, this provision would prevent the \nSecretary of the Army from using the discretion now provided in law to enforce or revise the \ncurrent Corps policy, based on consideration for public and employee safety, the security of \ncritical infrastructure, and the manner in which the firearm is carried (e.g., open vs. concealed).  \nCorps rangers are not authorized to carry firearms and do not have Federal law enforcement \nauthority.  \n \nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project \n \nOverall Funding.  The bill provides $957 million for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central \nUtah Project, $29 million below the FY 2015 Budget request.  While the Administration \nappreciates the Committee's support for the Bureau of Reclamation water resources program, \nincluding its support for water conservation funding that is even more critical during this period \nof extreme drought, the Administration urges the Congress to restore funding for the San Joaquin \nRiver Restoration and Policy and Administration.   \n \nSan Joaquin River Restoration.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's \nelimination of funding for this program, which would undermine the San Joaquin River \nRestoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water \nsupply impacts.  This restoration program is a multi-year effort that is integral to the \nimplementation of Federal legislation that settled 18 years of litigation.  The Congress has \n4  provided funding each year since authorizing, and the Administration urges the Congress to \nprovide FY 2015 funding for this Administration priority at the level requested. \n \nPolicy and Administration.  The Administration objects to the $5.7 million, or 10 percent, \nreduction in funding from the FY 2015 Budget request for Reclamation's Policy and \nAdministration account.  The FY 2015 Budget already proposed a reduction of $500,000 in \nrecognition of budget constraints.  The Committee's additional reduction would significantly \nimpair Reclamation's ability to conduct oversight, manage the agency effectively, and be \nresponsive to the Congress and the American public.  \n \nCentral Utah Project (CUP).  The Administration urges the Congress to consolidate the CUP \ninto the Bureau of Reclamation as requested in the FY 2015 Budget.  The consolidation would \nsimplify many administrative, budgeting, and reporting tasks while not adversely affecting \nproject performance.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n5  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n   \nJuly 23, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1582 - Energy Consumers Relief Act \n(Rep.

Yoho, R-Florida, and 17 cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes the substitute amendment to H.R. 5759 that seeks to restrict \nthe President\u2019s immigration accountability actions.  H.R. 5759 would make the broken \nimmigration system worse, not better.  By attempting to restrict the Administration\u2019s ability to \nconduct national security and criminal background checks on undocumented immigrants, H.R. \n5759 would make the Nation\u2019s communities less safe.  By attempting to make it more difficult \nfor undocumented workers to register and pay taxes, the bill would hurt the Nation\u2019s economy as \nwell.   \nThe President\u2019s recently announced immigration accountability executive actions will help \nsecure the border, hold potentially more than 4 million undocumented immigrants accountable, \nand ensure that everyone plays by the same rules.  In particular, these actions will allow \nundocumented immigrants who have resided in the United States for five or more years, are not \npriorities for removal, and are parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents to seek \ntemporary immigration relief, on a case-by-case basis, by registering, passing background \nchecks, and paying their fair share of taxes.  These actions also give additional DREAMers the \nopportunity to request immigration relief under the existing Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals (DACA) policy.   \nThe bill\u2019s objective is clearly to nullify and block implementation of these executive actions, \nwhich would have devastating consequences.  It would lead to the separation of families and \nprevent additional DREAMers from fully contributing to American life.  It would also make it \nmore difficult for immigration officials to conduct background checks, for undocumented \nworkers to help the economy by paying taxes, and for the Federal government to focus on \nremoving serious criminals, recent border crossers, and other threats.  \nThe President\u2019s actions will increase accountability in the Nation\u2019s broken immigration system \nwhile he continues to urge the Congress to finish the job and pass commonsense immigration\nreform that offers meaningful solutions to the broken system.   \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5759, his senior advisors would recommend that \nhe veto the bill. \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \nSeptember 16, 2014 \n(House Rules) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nH.R. 2 - American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs and More American Jobs Act \n(Rep.

It also would discourage environmental \nanalysis and civic engagement in Federal decision-making.  Furthermore, the bill would impose \na system for automatic approval of natural gas pipeline projects that could lead to confusion, \nincreased litigation, delay, and potential denial of the projects that the bill intends to expedite.  It \nalso would circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether cross-border \npipelines and electric transmission facilities are in the national interest by removing the \npresidential permitting requirement.  \n \nH.R. 2 would endanger public health and the environment by halting U.S. progress in cutting \ndangerous carbon pollution from power plants, prohibiting the Federal Government from \nensuring that hydraulic fracturing activities taking place on Federal and Indian lands are \nmanaged in a safe and responsible manner, and requiring the implementation of a court-vacated \nrule that would not adequately protect drinking water and watersheds from strip mining.  The bill \nalso would delay or potentially prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from \nfulfilling its legal obligation to protect public health and the environment by requiring the \nDepartment of Energy to undertake duplicate, costly, and time consuming reviews of energy-\nrelated EPA rules.  \n \nH.R. 2 runs contrary to the Administration's commitment to promoting safe and responsible \ndomestic oil and gas development as part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy to increase \ndomestic production and reduce dependence on foreign oil, while protecting the environment and \nhuman health. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \n                                                                     June 11, 2014 \n                                                                  (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENTOF DMINISTRATION OLICY\n       \nS. 2450 \u2013 Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability,  \nand Transparency Act of 2014  \n(Senator Sanders, I-Vermont, and 22 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration recognizes and appreciates the service and sacrifice made by servicemembers \nand veterans on behalf of the American people, and is committed to ensuring that we care for and \nhonor our servicemembers, veterans, and their families.  S. 2450 would make a number of \nchanges to authorities related to, among other things, improving access to care, training and \nhiring of health care staff, health care related to military sexual trauma, and veterans' education \nbenefits.  The bill reinforces a number of the Administration's efforts to address the challenges \nfacing today's servicemembers, veterans, and their families.  S. 2450 supports efforts to continue \nimproving veterans' access to healthcare, including for victims of military sexual trauma, and \nexpanded access to education benefits for veterans.   \n \nOur number one priority is getting veterans the care they\u2019ve earned.

Young, R-Indiana, and 210 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2575, the Save American Workers \nAct, because it would significantly increase the deficit and reduce the number of Americans with \nemployer-based health insurance coverage.  Rather than attempting once again to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act, which the House has tried to do over 50 times, it is time for the Congress to \nstop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater \neconomic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to get into the \nmiddle class. \n \nThis legislation would weaken a provision of the Affordable Care Act that keeps employers from \ndropping health insurance coverage and shifting the costs to taxpayers.  According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, it would increase the budget deficit by $73.7 billion over the 2015 \nto 2024 period.  Moreover, the proposed change would reduce the number of people receiving \nemployer-based coverage by about one million, while increasing the number of uninsured.   \n \nThe Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care.  Since October \n1, over seven million have signed up for insurance in the Health Insurance Marketplaces.  \nBecause of the Affordable Care Act, Americans who have previously been denied coverage due \nto a pre-existing medical condition now have access to coverage.  Additionally, the law helps \nmillions of Americans stay on their parents' plans until age 26, and provides access to free \npreventive care like cancer screenings that catch illness early on. \n \nWhile the Administration welcomes ideas to improve the law, H.R. 2575 would undermine it by \nshifting costs to taxpayers and causing employers either to drop or to not expand health insurance \ncoverage. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2575, he would veto it. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nApril 16, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 624 \u2013 Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act \n(Rep. Rogers, R-MI, and Rep. Ruppersberger, D-MD) \n \nBoth government and private companies need cyber threat information to allow them to identify, \nprevent, and respond to malicious activity that can disrupt networks and could potentially \ndamage critical infrastructure.  The Administration believes that carefully updating laws to \nfacilitate cybersecurity information sharing is one of several legislative changes essential to \nprotect individuals' privacy and improve the Nation's cybersecurity.  While there is bipartisan \nconsensus on the need for such legislation, it should adhere to the following priorities:  (1) \ncarefully safeguard privacy and civil liberties; (2) preserve the long-standing, respective roles \nand missions of civilian and intelligence agencies; and (3) provide for appropriate sharing with \ntargeted liability protections.  \n \nThe Administration recognizes and appreciates that the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence (HPSCI) adopted several amendments to H.R. 624 in an effort to incorporate the \nAdministration's important substantive concerns.  However, the Administration still seeks \nadditional improvements and if the bill, as currently crafted, were presented to the President, his \nsenior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration seeks to build upon \nthe continuing dialogue with the HPSCI and stands ready to work with members of Congress to \nincorporate our core priorities to produce cybersecurity information sharing legislation that \naddresses these critical issues.     \n \nH.R. 624 appropriately requires the Federal Government to protect privacy when handling \ncybersecurity information.  Importantly, the Committee removed the broad national security \nexemption, which significantly weakened the restrictions on how this information could be used \nby the government.  The Administration, however, remains concerned that the bill does not \nrequire private entities to take reasonable steps to remove irrelevant personal information when \nsending cybersecurity data to the government or other private sector entities.  Citizens have a \nright to know that corporations will be held accountable \u2013 and not granted immunity \u2013 for failing \nto safeguard personal information adequately.  The Administration is committed to working with \nall stakeholders to find a workable solution to this challenge.  Moreover, the Administration is \nconfident that such measures can be crafted in a way that is not overly onerous or cost \nprohibitive on the businesses sending the information.  Further, the legislation should also \nexplicitly ensure that cyber crime victims continue to report such crimes directly to Federal law \nenforcement agencies, and continue to receive the same protections that they do today. \n  \nThe Administration supports the longstanding tradition to treat the Internet and cyberspace as \ncivilian spheres, while recognizing that the Nation's cybersecurity requires shared responsibility \nfrom individual users, private sector network owners and operators, and the appropriate \ncollaboration of civilian, law enforcement, and national security entities in government.  H.R. \n624 appropriately seeks to make clear that existing public-private relationships \u2013 whether  voluntary, contractual, or regulatory \u2013 should be preserved and uninterrupted by this newly \nauthorized information sharing.  However, newly authorized information sharing for \ncybersecurity purposes from the private sector to the government should enter the government \nthrough a civilian agency, the Department of Homeland Security.     \n \nRecognizing that the government will continue to receive cybersecurity information through a \nrange of civilian, law enforcement, and national security agencies, legislation must promote \nappropriate sharing within the government.  As stated above, this sharing must be consistent with \ncybersecurity use restrictions, the cybersecurity responsibilities of the agencies involved, as well \nas privacy and civil liberties protections and transparent oversight.  Such intra-governmental \nsharing and use should not be subject to undue restrictions by the private sector companies that \noriginally share the information. To be successful in addressing the range of cyber threats the \nNation faces, it is vital that intra-governmental sharing be accomplished in as near real-time as \npossible.   \n \nThe Administration agrees with the need to clarify the application of existing laws to remove \nlegal barriers to the private sector sharing appropriate, well-defined, cybersecurity information.  \nFurther, the Administration supports incentivizing industry to share appropriate cybersecurity \ninformation by providing the private sector with targeted liability protections.  However, the \nAdministration is concerned about the broad scope of liability limitations in H.R. 624.  \nSpecifically, even if there is no clear intent to do harm, the law should not immunize a failure to \ntake reasonable measures, such as the sharing of information, to prevent harm when and if the \nentity knows that such inaction will cause damage or otherwise injure or endanger other entities \nor individuals.   \n \nInformation sharing is one piece of a larger set of legislative requirements to provide the private \nsector, the Federal Government, and law enforcement with the necessary tools to combat the \ncurrent and emerging cyber threats facing the Nation.  In addition to updating information \nsharing statutes, the Congress should incorporate privacy and civil liberties safeguards into all \naspects of cybersecurity and enact legislation that:  (1) strengthens the Nation's critical \ninfrastructure's cybersecurity by promoting the establishment and adoption of standards for \ncritical infrastructure; (2) updates laws guiding Federal agency network security; (3) gives law \nenforcement the tools to fight crime in the digital age; and (4) creates a National Data Breach \nReporting requirement. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n                                                                                                 March 12, 2014 \n                              (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4015 \u2013 SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 \n(Rep. Burgess, R-Texas, and 114 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4015, the SGR Repeal and \nMedicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 because it includes an offset that would \nincrease health insurance premiums, decrease tax credits, increase the number of uninsured, and \nshift costs to businesses, workers, and health care providers.  Rather than attempting once again \nto repeal the Affordable Care Act, which the House has tried to do over 50 times, it is time for \nthe Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on \nproviding greater economic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those \nworking to get into the middle class. \n \nMedicare payments to physicians are determined under a formula, commonly referred to as the \n\"sustainable growth rate\" (SGR).  This formula has called for reductions in physician payment \nrates since 2002, which the Congress has consistently overridden for over 10 years.  Under the \nSGR, Medicare physician payment rates would be reduced by about 24 percent in April 2014.  \nThe Administration is committed to working with the Congress to continue progress towards \nreforming Medicare physician payments to provide predictable payments that incentivize quality \nand efficiency in a fiscally-responsible way, and applauds the bipartisan, bicameral effort that led \nto the introduction of H.R. 4015 and S. 2000.  However, paying for these Medicare payment \nchanges by reducing coverage and increasing costs for millions would reverse progress being \nmade in making health care affordable and secure for all Americans. \n \nThe Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care.  Every day, \nthousands of Americans are signing up for insurance, and over 4.2 million have signed up so far.  \nBecause of the Affordable Care Act, Americans who have previously been denied coverage due \nto a pre-existing medical condition now have access to coverage.  Additionally, the law helps \nmillions of Americans stay on their parents' plans until age 26, and provides access to free \npreventive care like cancer screenings that catch illness early on. \n \nH.R. 4015 would delay the individual shared responsibility provision which is essential to \nensuring that the 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can get coverage without \nbeing charged more or losing coverage when they get sick.  This legislation would result in \nhigher numbers of uninsured Americans, higher premiums for those who remain insured, and \nfewer premium tax credits for middle-income families, and would increase cost-shifting of \nuncompensated care to health care providers, workers, and businesses. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4015, he would veto it. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJuly 9, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 761 \u2013 National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act of 2013 \n(Rep. Amodei, R-NV, and 57 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 761, which, though vaguely worded, would \nundermine and remove the environmental safeguards, for, at a minimum, almost all types of \nhardrock mines on Federal lands.  Notwithstanding the title and the stated purpose of the \nlegislation, H.R. 761, as reported by the House Natural Resources Committee, is drafted in such \na manner as to cover virtually all hardrock mining on Federal lands.  Protection of the public \nthrough sound Federal decision-making would be circumvented by the bill's provisions, which \ninclude the elimination of appropriate reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, the \ncircumvention of public involvement in any mining proposals, and the bypassing of the \nformulation of alternatives to proposals, among other deleterious stipulations.  The \nAdministration strongly supports the development of rare earth elements and other critical \nminerals, but rejects the notion that their development is incompatible with environmental \nprotection and public involvement in agency decision-making.  \n \nThe legislation also undermines existing law safeguarding the multiple uses of public lands by \nplacing mining interests above all other uses.  This change has the potential to threaten hunting, \nfishing, recreation, and other activities that create jobs and sustain local economies across the \ncountry.  Furthermore, the Administration opposes the legislation's severe restrictions on judicial \nreview.

Young, R-Indiana, and 164 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, and \ntailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner.  Accordingly, \nthe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 367, the Regulations From the \nExecutive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2013, which would impose an unprecedented requirement \nthat a joint resolution of approval be enacted by the Congress before any major rule of Executive \nBranch agencies could have force or effect.  This radical departure from the longstanding \nseparation of powers between the Executive and Legislative branches would delay and, in many \ncases, thwart implementation of statutory mandates and execution of duly-enacted laws, create \nbusiness uncertainty, undermine much-needed protections of the American public, and cause \nunnecessary confusion. \n \nThere is no justification for such an unprecedented requirement.  When a Federal agency \npromulgates a major rule, it must already adhere to the particular requirements of the statute that \nit is implementing and to the constraints imposed by other Federal statutes and the \nConstitution.  Indeed, in many cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the \nparticular rule.  The agency must also comply with the rulemaking requirements of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551, et seq.).  When an agency issues a major rule, it \nmust perform analyses of benefits and costs, analyses that are typically required by one or more \nstatutes (such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, and the \nPaperwork Reduction Act) as well as by Executive Orders 12866 and 13563. \n \nIn addition, this Administration has already taken numerous steps to reduce regulatory costs and \nto ensure that all major regulations are designed to maximize net benefits to society.  Executive \nOrder 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, public participation, harmonization of \nrulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a regulatory retrospective \nreview.  In addition, Executive Order 13610 further institutionalizes retrospective review by \nrequiring agencies to report regularly on the ways they are identifying and reducing the burden \nof existing regulations.  Finally, agency rules are subject to the jurisdiction of Federal courts. \n \nMoreover, for the past 17 years, the Congress itself has had the opportunity, under the \nCongressional Review Act of 1996, to review on an individual basis the rules \u2013 both major and \nnon-major \u2013 that Federal agencies have issued. \n \nBy replacing this well-established framework with a blanket requirement of Congressional \napproval, H.R. 367 would throw all major regulations into a months-long limbo, fostering \nuncertainty and impeding business investment that is vital to economic growth.  Maintaining an \nappropriate allocation of responsibility between the two branches is essential to ensuring that the \nNation's regulatory system effectively protects public health, welfare, safety, and our  environment, while also promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job \ncreation. \n \nIf the President were presented H.R. 367, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the \nbill. \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                     \n                    February 5, 2014 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3964 \u2013 Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act  \n(Rep.

California is experiencing \nsevere drought conditions and low reservoir storage.  The urgency and seriousness of the situation \nrequires a balanced approach that promotes water reliability and ecosystem restoration.   \n \nSpecifically, H.R. 3964 would undermine years of collaboration between local, State, and Federal \nstakeholders to develop a sound water quality control plan for the Bay-Delta.  And, contrary to current \nand past Federal reclamation law that defers to State water law, the bill would preempt California \nwater law.  Moreover, much of what the bill purports to do could be accomplished through \nflexibilities in existing law. \n \nThe bill also would reject the long-standing principle that beneficiaries should pay both the cost of \ndeveloping water supplies and of mitigating resulting development impacts, and would exacerbate \ncurrent water shortages by repealing water pricing reforms that provide incentives for contractors to \nconserve water supplies. \n \nFinally, H.R. 3964 would repeal the San Joaquin River Settlement Agreement, which the Congress \nenacted to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation.  Full repeal of the settlement agreement would \nlikely result in the resumption of costly litigation, creating an uncertain future for river restoration and \nwater delivery operations for water users on the San Joaquin River. \n \nCalifornians are facing significant drought-related challenges.  This is why the President has \ndirected the Federal agencies to work together to help California and other impacted States prepare \nfor and lessen the impact of the drought.  Further, it is why the Administration strongly supports \nefforts to provide a more reliable water supply for California and to protect, restore, and enhance the \noverall quality of the Bay-Delta environment.  The Administration has taken great strides toward \nachieving these goals through a coordinated Federal Action Plan, which has strengthened \ncollaboration between Federal agencies and the State of California while achieving results.  \nUnfortunately, H.R. 3964 would undermine these efforts and the progress that has been made.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress on legislation to address the drought in \nCalifornia and supports efforts that provide water supplies consistent with existing law in the most \nexpeditious manner to address the conditions.  These efforts would include reauthorization of the \nCALFED Bay-Delta Act, the Secure Water Act, and Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief \nAct.   \nFor these reasons, if the President were presented with H.R. 3964, his senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \nMay 22, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 1911 \u2013 Smarter Solutions for Students Act \n(Rep.

Under the President's \nproposal, the rate on new Federal student loans would be set each year based on the Treasury's \nactual cost of borrowing, and would remain fixed for the life of the loan so that borrowers would \nhave certainty about the rates they would pay.  The President's proposal also would expand the \"Pay \nAs You Earn\" repayment option to ensure that no student borrower is required to pay more than ten \npercent of his or her discretionary income on student loans. \n \nWhile the Administration welcomes action by the House on this issue, H.R. 1911 is the wrong \napproach.  First, the bill would not guarantee low rates for today's students.  A rate that continues to \nvary after the loan has already been taken out would create uncertainty and lessen transparency for \nstudents and their families who are making decisions about borrowing for college.  Second, the bill's \nchanges would impose the largest interest rate increases on low- and middle-income students and \nfamilies who struggle most to afford a college education.  Third, the bill does not include the \nPresident's proposal to extend repayment options to borrowers who have already left school and \noften face the same debt burdens as current and future students.  Finally, the Administration \nbelieves that student loan interest rates should not be raised to reduce the deficit.  \n \nIf the President were presented with this legislation in its current form, his senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n   \nJuly 24, 2013 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nSenate Amendment to H.R. 1911 \u2013 Smarter Solutions for Students Act  \n(Senator Manchin, D-WV) \n \nOn July 1st, the interest rate on new subsidized Federal Direct Stafford Loans for undergraduate \nstudents doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.  As the economy continues to recover, and at a \ntime when market interest rates are near historic lows, students who rely on these loans to finance \npostsecondary education should not be burdened with high interest rates as they seek to graduate, \nlaunch a career or a business, start a family, or buy a house.   \n \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the amendment in the nature of a substitute \nto H.R. 1911, the Smarter Solutions for Students Act, which is an important step toward making \ncollege more affordable for all Americans, and commends the bipartisan effort that led to the \nconsideration of this legislation.  It would reduce interest rates for nearly 11 million borrowers \ntaking out new loans this school year, including those who borrowed since the rates rose on July 1st.  \nAlso, it would cut rates on all types of borrowers this year, including those for undergraduates \ntaking out unsubsidized Stafford loans, graduate students, and parent borrowers. \n \nThe Senate amendment does not contain the flaws that were in some of the previous legislative \nefforts to address this issue.  In particular, the amendment rejects a variable interest rate that resets \nevery year, which would put students at risk of paying more over time.  Instead, it would give \nborrowers the certainty of a fixed interest rate on each loan to eliminate the risk of being burdened \nwith additional costs, and would provide firm caps on how high interest rates on new student loans \ncan rise in the future.  The amendment also rejects unfair and unwise approaches that would raise \nstudent loan interest rates to pay for deficit reduction.  \n \nThere is much more to do to ensure that college tuition and student loans are affordable for the \nmiddle class and those striving to join it.  The Administration looks forward to working with the \nCongress over the upcoming year to make additional progress on these challenges, including \nthrough the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \n                    July 23, 2014 \n                    (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 2569 \u2013 Bring Jobs Home Act \n(Sen. Walsh, D-Montana, and 24 cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2569, a bill that would encourage \ncompanies to invest in the United States and bring jobs back while preventing companies from \nreceiving tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas. \nThe Nation's tax code does too little to encourage job creation and investment in the United \nStates while allowing firms to benefit from incentives to locate production and jobs overseas.  \nThis bill can help attract and keep jobs in the United States by providing a 20 percent general \nbusiness tax credit for eligible expenditures associated with bringing jobs back, which is paid for \nby preventing firms from receiving tax breaks for deducting expenses associated with \noutsourcing.  \nSenate passage of this bill is consistent with the Administration's commitment to support \neconomic growth, job creation, and business investment in the United States, and serves to \ndiscourage outsourcing in all sectors of the economy, but particularly in the Nation's \nmanufacturing sector.  Following a decade in which the United States lost over five million \nmanufacturing jobs, the Nation has begun to make progress.  Since February 2010, the U.S. \nmanufacturing sector has added more than 650,000 new jobs, the fastest pace of manufacturing \njob growth since the mid-1990s.  Instead of rewarding firms for shifting production and jobs \noverseas, the tax code should strengthen the domestic manufacturing sector, support job growth \nand innovation, and encourage companies from all sectors of the economy to invest in the United \nStates.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to encourage companies to \ninvest in America and bring jobs home. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \nSeptember 26, 2013 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nSenate Amendment 1974 to H.J.

Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe President is committed to our national defense and funding other important priorities within \na budget framework that strengthens our economy and advances middle-class priorities.  The \nAdministration believes H.R. 2397, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other purposes, funds critical priorities, and looks \nforward to working on its provisions as part of an acceptable budget framework. \n \nHowever, enacting H.R. 2397, while adhering to the overall spending limits in the House \nBudget's topline discretionary level for fiscal year (FY) 2014, would hurt our economy and \nrequire draconian cuts to middle-class priorities.  These cuts could result in hundreds of \nthousands of low-income children losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of \nchildren with disabilities losing Federal funding for their special education teachers and aides, \nthousands of Federal agents who cannot enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend \nfugitives, and thousands of scientists without medical grants, which would slow research that \ncould lead to new treatments and cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, and hurt \nAmerica's economic competitiveness.  \n \nMore than three months have passed since the deadline for action and the Congress has yet to \nappoint conferees and agree on a budget resolution. Prior to consideration of appropriations bills \nthe Congress should complete an appropriate framework for all the appropriations bills.   \n \nUnless this bill passes the Congress in the context of an overall budget framework that supports \nour recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and \nnational security for our economy to compete in the future, the President's senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto H.R. 2397 and any other legislation that implements the House \nRepublican Budget framework. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill.   \n \nSexual Assault Prevention and Response.  The Administration appreciates the support of the \nCommittee in working to eliminate the threat that sexual assault in the military presents to our \nService members and our national security. \n \nDetainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions of sections 8107 and \n8108 that limit the use of funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee transfers, \nwhich, in certain circumstances, would violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  \nSection 8107 undermines national security and this unnecessarily constrains the Nation's \ncounterterrorism efforts, particularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013  option for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties \nhave leveraged the flexibility and strength of this country's Federal courts to incapacitate \ndangerous terrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The continued prosecution of terrorists in \nFederal court is an essential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must \nremain an available option.  Additionally, the restrictions in section 8108 on the transfer of \ndetainees to the United States and to the custody or effective control of foreign countries or \nentities in the context of an ongoing armed conflict may interfere with the Executive Branch's \nability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and to make important foreign policy \nand national security determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such \ntransfers should occur. \n \nIn addition, the Administration strongly opposes section 8109, which would prohibit the use of \nfunds to construct, acquire, or modify a detention facility in the United States to house \nindividuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This would constrain the \nflexibility that the Nation's Armed Forces and counterterrorism professionals need to deal with \nevolving threats, intruding upon the Executive Branch's ability to carry out its mission.  \n \nTopline Funding Levels.  The Administration strongly objects to unrequested Overseas \nContingency Operations (OCO) funding in the bill and the reduction of base budget funding \nrelative to the President's request.  The FY 2014 Budget carefully aligns program priorities and \nresources based on the President's strategic guidance, and it fully funds OCO requirements.  \n \nBase Realignment and Closure (BRAC).  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to \nprovide BRAC authorization and funding as requested so that the Department of Defense (DOD) \ncan right-size its infrastructure while providing appropriate transition assistance to affected \ncommunities.  Without a new round of BRAC, DOD cannot properly align the military's \ninfrastructure with the needs of its evolving force structure, a critical tool for ensuring that \nlimited resources are available to the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security.   \n \nTRICARE Fees and Co-Payments.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to support its \nproposed TRICARE fee increases, because military retirees deserve an excellent, sustainable \nhealth care benefit.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee has consistently \nfailed to support requested TRICARE fee initiatives that seek to control DOD's spiraling health \ncare costs while keeping retired beneficiaries' share of these costs well below the levels \nexperienced when the TRICARE program was implemented in the mid-1990s.  While the bill \nrestores the projected FY 2014 TRICARE savings associated with the initiatives, the Department \nwill be forced to make deeper reductions to troop levels, readiness and modernization accounts \nin order to offset higher health care costs of over $8 billion through FY 2018.   \n \nMilitary Pay.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to include the proposal to set the \nmilitary pay raise growth at 1.0 percent in FY 2014.  Consistent with the views of the uniformed \nmilitary leadership, the President's Budget requests a 1.0 percent increase to basic pay, a 4.2 \npercent increase in the Basic Allowance for Housing, and a 3.4 percent increase in Basic \nAllowance for Subsistence.  This total compensation level recognizes the sacrifices made by the \nmen and women in our Armed Forces, while adhering to the current budget constraints faced by \nDOD.  The bill provides $580 million in additional appropriations to fund the pay raise in \nFY 2014, but it would increase costs by a total of $3.5 billion from FY 2014 through FY 2018.  \nAfter FY 2014, these future costs would need to be offset by deeper reductions to troop levels, \nreadiness and modernization accounts at a time when statutory spending caps require defense \nreductions.  \n2   \nBuilding Partner Capacity.  The Administration strongly objects to reductions in funds for \nprograms to build partner capacity, which would limit the Department's ability to address current \nand emerging threats to our national security.  The bill provides $83 million less than the $358 \nmillion requested for the Global Train and Equip program and does not fund the request for $75 \nmillion for the Global Security Contingency Fund.   \n \nNational Intelligence Program Consolidation.  The Administration strongly objects to section \n8105 because the provision's prohibitions would impinge on the President's prerogatives to seek \nefficient budget structures and unduly constrain the President in future budget decisions.  \n \nUnrequested Funding.  The Administration is concerned about the billions of dollars provided \nfor items DOD did not request and does not need, such as Light Utility Helicopters, National \nGuard High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV), additional medical research, \nand the modernization of seven cruisers and two amphibious ships.  The Administration is also \nconcerned that the bill makes spending on these and other unnecessary items statutorily required, \ndiverting scarce resources from more important defense programs and limiting the Secretary's \nflexibility to manage the Department efficiently.  \n \nC-130 Avionics Modernization Program (C-130 AMP).  The Administration objects to the $47 \nmillion in unrequested funding provided for the C-130 AMP, which would start initial \nproduction of C-130 AMP kits for the modernization of earlier generation C-130 airlift aircraft.  \nThe President's FY 2013 Budget canceled the C-130 AMP because of its high total program cost \nof $2.7 billion, and because the aircraft would still be able to perform their missions with less \nexpensive upgrades.  In addition, as required by the FY 2013 National Defense Authorization \nAct, DOD is conducting an independent cost-benefit analysis of the C-130 AMP, and it would be \npremature to reinstate the program before that study is complete.  \n \nAdvanced Innovative Technologies.  The Administration objects to the $115 million cut for \nAdvanced Innovative Technologies, an 88 percent reduction from the President's request, which \nfunds on-going research and development efforts that support the new Defense Strategy and the \nrebalance to the Asia Pacific.  Specifically, this program supports initiatives that would provide \ncost-effective and cost-imposing capabilities that are critical for meeting the Combatant \nCommander's objectives in the region.  This capability is needed to address real world threats \nand full funding is required to research, develop and test performance of the Electromagnetic \nRailgun system. \n \nJoint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF).  The Administration objects to the elimination \nof funding requested for the JUONF.  This funding is critical to DOD's ability to quickly respond \nto urgent operational needs of Combatant Commanders.  Elimination of funding may delay \nfielding of important capabilities that help accomplish critical missions.   \n \nScience, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Programs.  The Administration \nobjects to the restoration of funding for the STARBASE program, which would perpetuate the \nFederal Government's fragmented approach to STEM education, whereby more than 220 \nprograms are scattered across 13 agencies.  The Administration's proposed reorganization of \nSTEM programs would improve STEM education quality and outcomes across the Federal \nGovernment.   \n \n \n3  Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund (DAWDF).  The Administration opposes the \nreduction of $205 million from the FY 2014 Budget request for the DAWDF.  Failure to provide \nthe full request would require DOD to collect the shortfall between the appropriation and the \nstatutory minimum for DAWDF from other budget accounts.  In addition, the Administration \nopposes appropriations language that would not allow use of prior year expired funds for the   \nFY 2014 DAWDF collection.  Components should be allowed to use these funds per the \nauthority provided in current law.   \n \nCivilian Pay Raise.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent \npay increase for Federal civilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a \npermanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.   \n \nMissile Defense.  The Administration appreciates the support for DOD's air and missile defense \nprograms, as well as support for the government of Israel's Iron Dome rocket system.   \n \nAfghanistan Security Forces Fund.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued \nstrong support for U.S. efforts to build and develop the security forces of Afghanistan.  However, \nthe Administration strongly urges the Congress to make $2.6 billion of the $7.7 billion request \ncontingent upon pending policy decisions and the progress made by the Afghan National \nSecurity Forces during FY 2014, as requested in the President's Budget. \n \nLimitation on Funds Available to Procure Equipment.  The Administration appreciates the \nsupport of the Committee for a responsive and flexible program to train and equip the security \nforces of Afghanistan.  However, the Administration is concerned that some of the limitations \nproposed in section 8119 will prevent the Department from meeting critical equipment \nrequirements and delivery timelines for the Afghan National Security Forces and will \nunnecessarily increase costs for the U.S. taxpayer.  The Administration urges the Congress to \nwork with the Department to develop an alternative approach. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n4  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n                    July 17, 2014 \n                    (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 2244 -- Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014 \n(Sen.

Terrorism insurance is necessary for a broad range of economic activities in \nareas across the country, and would be prohibitively expensive or unavailable in the absence of \nthe Program.  Since it was first established in 2003, the Program has effectively kept terrorism \ninsurance available and affordable so that American businesses can secure necessary coverage, \nthereby promoting economic growth and employment opportunities for American workers. \nReauthorizing the Program will ensure that the American economy remains resilient against the \nthreat of terrorism.  The Administration supports swift passage of this legislation and looks \nforward to working with Congress on this reauthorization and reform process.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                         \n     \n \nSeptember 16, 2014 \n                    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4 \u2013 Jobs for America Act \n(Rep. Camp, R-Michigan, and 4 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4, which incorporates several bills \nthat have previously been passed by the House during this Congress, including a number of bills \nfor which the Administration issued Statements of Administration Policy strongly opposing \npassage and indicating that, if presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend \nthat he veto them.    \n \nThe Administration wants to work with Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen \nthe economy and help middle class families, including pro-growth business tax reform.  The \nAdministration continues to support tax proposals that would benefit the Nation\u2019s economy and \nsmall businesses, such as making permanent the research and experimentation tax credit and \nincreased expensing for small businesses.  However, making traditional tax extenders and costly \nbusiness tax cuts permanent without offsets, while at the same time allowing taxes to increase on \n26 million working families, represents the wrong approach. \n \nIn addition, the Administration welcomes ideas to improve the Affordable Care Act.  However, \nH.R. 4 would undermine that Act by shifting costs to taxpayers and causing fewer Americans to \nhave employer-sponsored health insurance coverage.  \n \nAlso, the Administration is committed to ensuring that the benefits of regulation justify their \ncosts and that they are tailored to advance statutory goals in a manner that is efficient, is cost-\neffective, and minimizes uncertainty.  However, H.R. 4 would throw all major regulations into a \nmonths-long limbo, marking a significant departure from the longstanding separation of powers \nbetween the Executive and Legislative branches and, fostering uncertainty and impeding \nbusiness investment that is vital to economic growth.  Furthermore, the bill would impose other \nunnecessary requirements on agencies that would seriously undermine their ability to execute \ntheir statutory mandates. \n \nFinally, the Administration is committed to sound long-term management of Federal lands for \ncontinued productivity and economic benefit, as well as for the long-term health of the wildlife \nand ecological values sustained by these holdings.  However, H.R. 4 includes numerous harmful \nprovisions that would impair responsible management of Federally-owned lands and undermine \nmany important existing public land and environmental laws, rules, and processes. \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \nJune 10, 2014 \n                    (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4457 -- America\u2019s Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 \n(Rep. Tiberi, R-OH, and 17 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration supports making permanent expanded expensing for small businesses and \noffsetting the cost by closing tax loopholes.  Enhanced small business expensing supports small \nbusinesses in making investments and creating jobs.  Small businesses employ half of the \nNation\u2019s workforce and create nearly two out of every three jobs.  \n  \nHowever, as with other similar proposals, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of \nH.R. 4457, which would permanently extend and expand the current expensing provisions for \nsmall businesses without offsetting the cost, adding to long-run deficits.  \n  \nBy making expanded expensing for small business permanent without offsets, H.R. 4457 would \nadd $73 billion to the deficit over the next ten years.  Moreover, if this unprecedented approach \nof making major traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other \ntraditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits, wiping out most of the \ndeficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.  Just two months \nago, House Republicans passed a budget resolution that required offsets for any tax extenders \nthat were made permanent with other revenue measures.  \n  \nWith this legislation, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the deficit to fund \ntax breaks for businesses, while insisting on offsetting the cost of measures that help middle-\nclass and working Americans.  The cost of H.R. 4457 is many times the cost of the proposed \nextension of emergency unemployment benefits, which House Republicans insist be offset, and \nmore than the discretionary funding increases for defense and non-defense priorities such as \nresearch and development in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which were offset.  House \nRepublicans also are making clear their priorities by rushing to make business tax cuts \npermanent without offsets even as the House Republican budget resolution calls for raising taxes \non 25 million working families and students by letting important improvements to the Earned \nIncome Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and education tax credits expire.  \n  \nThe Administration wants to work with Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen \nthe economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax reform.  \nHowever, making traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets represents the wrong \napproach.  \n  \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4457, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * *   ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n  January 14, 2014 \n  (House Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nHouse Amendment to H.R. 3547 \u2013 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 \n(Rep.

VAWA transformed the Nation's response to violence against \nwomen and brought critically needed resources to States and local communities to address these \ncrimes.  \n \nThe Administration is pleased that S. 47 continues that bipartisan progress and targets resources to \naddress today\u02c8s most pressing issues.  Sexual assault remains one of the most underreported violent \ncrimes in the country.  The bill provides funding through State grants to improve the criminal justice \nresponse to sexual assault and to better connect victims with services.  Further, the bill seeks to reduce \ndomestic violence homicides and address the high rates of violence experienced by teens and young \nadults.  Reaching young people through early intervention can break the cycle of violence.  \nThe Administration strongly supports measures in S. 47 that will bring justice to Native American \nvictims.

Enzi, R-WY, and 28 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly supports S. 743, which will level the playing field for local small \nbusiness retailers that are in competition every day with large out-of-state online companies. \n \nAlthough States presently have the authority to tax the sale of goods or services sold from out-of-\nstate vendors, they are prevented under current law from requiring the collection of such duly-\nenacted taxes.  As a consequence, while local small business retailers follow the law and collect \nsales taxes from customers who make purchases in their stores, many big business online and \ncatalog retailers do not collect the same taxes.  Because these out-of-state companies are able to \nplay by a different set of rules, this disparity undermines the ability of cities and States to invest \nin K-12 education, police and fire protection, access to affordable health care, and funding for \nroads and bridges.  This bill would eliminate the unfair advantage currently enjoyed by big out-\nof-state online companies over local neighborhood-based small businesses. \n \nIn recent years, collection technologies have improved and States have made significant strides \nto cut red tape and simplify their tax systems.  At the same time, Internet-facilitated sales \ncontinue to grow as a share of total transactions, contributing to ongoing State budget pressures.  \nIn recognition of these developments, a broad and growing group of bipartisan State and Federal \nleaders \u2014 including governors, mayors, business and labor groups, and members of Congress \nfrom both parties \u2014 has called for commonsense Federal legislation to make the system more \nfair.   \n \nThe Administration strongly supports provisions in S. 743 that would directly address those \nconcerns by granting only those States and localities that have simplified their sales tax systems \nthe option to require all retailers, including those located out-of-state, to collect sales and use \ntaxes already owed under law.  The Administration also is pleased that S. 743 provides an \nexception for small online businesses and requires States to make available, at no cost to \nretailers, software that helps calculate the State sales tax on remote transactions, as well as \nadministrative services. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this bipartisan legislation to \nsupport State and local priorities and promote a level playing field for local retailers.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJanuary 9, 2014 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3362 \u2013 Exchange Information Disclosure Act \n(Rep.

Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4800, making appropriations for \nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes.  The bill undermines key \ninvestments in financial oversight, injects political decision-making into science-based nutrition \nstandards, and includes objectionable language riders.  If the President were presented with H.R. \n4800, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations \nprocess that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding \nunnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include \nreconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and \nnational security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an \norderly appropriations process.  \n \nThe President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to \naccelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our \nnational security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same \ntime, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to \ndeliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.  The \nPresident's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget \nAct (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels\u2014increasing rental \nassistance for rural families, supporting critical nutrition programs for mothers and young \nchildren, and providing resources to implement the critical financial protections established in \nthe Wall Street Reform Act.  However, the levels agreed to in the BBA are already below \nFY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation and are not sufficient\u2014either in FY 2015 or \nbeyond\u2014to ensure the Nation is achieving its full potential.  For that reason, the Budget also \nincludes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative\u2014evenly split between \ndefense and non-defense priorities\u2014that presents additional investments to grow the economy, \nexpand opportunity, and enhance security.  The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative \nwould support over $270 million in priority research in areas such as advanced genetics, earth \nscience, and climate change resilience.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve these issues during the \nFY 2015 appropriations process.  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) \n \nChild Nutrition.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that would require the \nSecretary to establish a waiver process to eliminate current nutrition requirements for school \nbreakfasts and lunches during the 2014-2015 school year for any school or district that \ndemonstrates a net operating loss on school meals for at least six months beginning in July 2013.    \nThis would be a major step backwards for the health of American children by undermining the \neffort to provide kids with more nutritious food.  More generally, the Administration strongly \nopposes the inclusion of any language in the bill that would override science-based standards that \nimprove child nutrition.  \n \nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).  The \nAdministration is strongly opposed to language in the bill that would require the inclusion of \nwhite potatoes in the WIC food package, while taking the unprecedented step of overriding the \nscience-based review process used to determine which foods should be included in the WIC food \npackage.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides sufficient funding to \nserve all projected WIC participants for FY 2015, but urges the Congress to fully fund the \nFY 2015 Budget request for $150 million in contingency funds to ensure that the program has \nsufficient resources to meet unexpected changes in participation.  \n \nChild Nutrition School Equipment Grants.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's \ncontinued support for school meals equipment grants, but urges the Congress to fully fund the \nFY 2015 Budget request of $35 million to help school districts purchase the equipment needed to \nserve healthier meals, improve food safety, expand access to meals, and improve energy \nefficiency.   \n \nHealthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI).  The Administration is concerned that the Committee \ndid not provide the requested $13 million for the newly authorized HFFI program in the most \nrecent Farm Bill.  This program would be used to support increased access to healthy foods in \nunderserved areas, create and preserve quality jobs, and revitalize low income communities.  \n \nFood Aid Reform.  The Administration is concerned that the bill excludes food aid reforms \nproposed in the President's Budget that would support two million more people in crises without \nadditional resources. The bill also eliminates some flexible food purchase authority provided in \nthe FY 2014 appropriations process.  Further, by raising the non-emergency food aid floor to \n$375 million from the level in the most recent Farm Bill, the bill reduces the amount that would \notherwise be available for emergency food aid.  At a time when major food crises are increasing, \nincluding those in South Sudan and Syria, these reforms are critically needed.  \n \nNational Institute of Food and Agriculture.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee \nincluded no funding to support the three research innovation institutes, as requested in the \nFY 2015 Budget, and recommended by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and \nTechnology.  These institutes would provide competitive grants to support public-private \ncooperation for pollinator health research, advanced manufacturing, and anti-microbial \nresistance, all important issues facing the Nation.   \n \nRental Assistance Grant Program.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully \nfunds Rental Assistance Grants at $1.1 billion.  The Administration encourages the Congress to    \n2  adopt all of the funding flexibilities proposed in the FY 2015 Budget in order to improve the \nmanagement and efficiency of the program.   \n \nSummer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Demonstration.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee providing $27 million to support summer EBT pilots, consistent with the President's \npolicy.  These pilots are proving successful in reducing childhood hunger and improving \nnutrition in the months when school meals are unavailable.   \n \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n \nFDA Rulemaking Rider.  The Administration strongly opposes provisions that unduly interfere \nwith FDA's rulemaking process.  The bill includes a general provision that withholds $20 million \nfrom FDA's Salaries and Expenses account until FDA issues final guidance on abuse-deterrent \nformulations of opioids.  FDA is committed to publishing final guidance in a timely manner once \ncomments received on the draft guidance have been considered.  Withholding funds until the \nfinal guidance is published would limit FDA's ability to dedicate staff and resources \nappropriately and could have far-reaching negative impacts on FDA's public health mission.   \n \nUser Fees.  The Administration continues to support new proposed user fees that would provide \nvital resources to enhance FDA's capacity to support a prevention-based food safety system and \nurges the Congress to enact these user fees as proposed in the FY 2015 Budget request.   \n \nOther Agencies \n \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The Administration strongly opposes the $62 \nmillion reduction in funding from the FY 2015 Budget request for CFTC.  The further reduction \nto the amount available for salaries and other general expenses would reduce the number of \nCFTC staff and significantly impede the Commission's ability to perform its market oversight \nfunctions and fully implement enacted financial reforms to protect investors.   \n \nCivilian Pay Raise \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for \nFederal civilian employees to help the Government remain competitive in attracting and \nretaining our Federal workforce.  A 1.0 percent civilian pay increase reflects the tight budget \nconstraints that we continue to face, while also recognizing the critical role civilian employees \nplay for the Nation\u2014doing everything from assuring the safety of our food and airways, to \nsecuring our borders, to searching for cures to diseases.  It also recognizes the sacrifices they \nhave already made through prior pay freezes and last year's furloughs due to sequestration.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nDecember 3, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3309 \u2013 Innovation Act \n(Rep.

The bill builds on the important patent reforms \ncontained in the America Invents Act (P.L. 112-29) and successfully implemented by the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office.  The bill would improve incentives for future innovation while \nprotecting the overall integrity of the patent system.   \n \nOn June 4, 2013, the Administration recommended seven legislative measures to the Congress \ndesigned to protect innovators from frivolous litigation and ensure the highest-quality \npatents.  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of many of these measures in H.R. 3309 \nand supports the bill\u2019s provisions to require disclosures in patent infringement cases, streamline \nactions involving end-users, and provide educational resources for small businesses.  By \nreducing unnecessary costs of patent litigation, it also represents significant progress on the \nefforts to level the playing field for small innovators.  The Administration supports the effort to \ndiscourage abusive court filings, but hopes that, as final legislation is crafted, appropriate \nrecognition is given to the importance of judicial discretion in balancing competing \ninterests.  Finally, the Administration continues to have concerns about the bill\u2019s provisions on \npost-issuance review proceedings, including those pertaining to patent claim construction.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to advance this important \nbipartisan legislation and to include additional provisions that the Administration recommended \nto help protect innovators, including transparency of demand letters and pre-litigation patent \nownership. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \n  March 12, 2014 \n  (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 4138 \u2013 Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect  \nCongressional Enactments of the Law (ENFORCE the Law) Act of 2014 \n(Rep.

But the power \nthe bill purports to assign to Congress to sue the President over whether he has properly \ndischarged his constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed exceeds \nconstitutional limitations.  Congress may not assign such power to itself, nor may it assign to the \ncourts the task of resolving such generalized political disputes.       \n  \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 4138, his senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nOctober 23, 2013 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3080 - Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013 \n(Rep. Shuster, R-PA, and 47 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration supports investing in the Nation's water resources to build the foundation for \nlong-term economic growth, to address significant risks to public safety, and to protect and \nrestore our environment.  The Administration's key policies and principles will help meet our \nNation's water resources challenges in a fiscally responsible way.  The Administration supports \nHouse passage of H.R. 3080 as it would advance some of these policies and principles, but it \nshould be improved with additional reforms and modifications of problematic provisions. \n \nCurrently, the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has a $60 billion construction backlog and \nincreasing operation and maintenance costs of existing infrastructure.  The Administration \nsupports provisions in the bill to de-authorize projects that no longer meet the Nation's needs or \nhave become too costly.  The bill, however, would authorize the Corps to construct several new \nprojects that the Administration has not recommended for authorization due to their marginal \nreturn on investment or other concerns.  The Administration would like to work with Congress \non authorizations of projects and studies that provide high economic and environmental returns \nto the Nation, or address a significant risk to public safety, within the Corps' three main \nmissions: flood and storm damage reduction; commercial navigation; and aquatic ecosystem \nrestoration. \n \nCreating and maintaining our Nation's water resources infrastructure is a shared responsibility \nbetween federal and non-federal beneficiaries and requires that the management, use, protection, \nand restoration of our water resources continue to evolve to meet the Nation's future needs.  H.R. \n3080 would enable non-federal parties to move forward with certain water resources projects on \ntheir own more easily.  However, it would also weaken key reforms enacted by the Congress in \nthe landmark Water Resources Development Act of 1986.  For example, the bill would shift \nsignificant costs to the taxpayer that are now the responsibility of barge operators on inland \nwaterways, and would expand the Federal role in the maintenance of coastal ports to areas that \nhave historically been a non-federal responsibility. \n \nThe Administration is concerned that the project permitting and delivery provisions in H.R. 3080 \nmay slow project approval and do not adequately protect communities, taxpayers, or the \nenvironment.  The Administration appreciates the omission of financial penalty provisions for \nagencies; however, the bill includes provisions that could constrain science-based decision \nmaking, increase litigation risk, and undermine the integrity of several foundational \nenvironmental laws, including the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the \nNational Environmental Policy Act.  The Administration is making significant progress to \nimprove the efficiency of Federal permitting and reviews in a manner that encourages early \ncollaboration, stakeholder engagement and better environmental outcomes while not \njeopardizing bedrock environmental laws.  The Administration urges the House to reaffirm the  current foundational environmental review framework for all water resources projects that \nfosters transparency, informed decision-making, and strong environmental outcomes, and to \nencourage the Corps to continue efforts to evaluate the full range of reasonable alternatives, \nincluding the use of natural infrastructure where appropriate, and to promote better \nenvironmental stewardship. \n \nThe Administration supports efforts to enhance resilience in light of future risks of substantial \nstorm and flood damage, including from a changing climate.  Federal policies and investments \nshould encourage and incentivize improved management of water and related land resources at \nthe local level to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance the resiliency and natural functions of \nfloodplains and coastal areas and the communities in them, advance public safety, and promote \nefforts to preserve and restore aquatic ecosystems. \n \nThe Administration also urges reform of the laws governing the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, \nwhich a proposal in the President\u2019s FY 2014 Budget would accomplish.  The proposal would \nestablish an annual per vessel fee to raise $1.1 billion in additional revenue over 10 years from \nthe commercial users of the inland waterways.  It would support economic growth, and reflect \nactual costs incurred by the Corps on their behalf. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n                    April 8, 2014 \n                    (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 2199 -- Paycheck Fairness Act \n(Sen.

Today, women represent almost half of the workforce and, in many \ncases, are either the sole or primary source of income for their family.  Despite their increased \npresence in the workforce and increasingly important role as family breadwinner, women \ncontinue to earn substantially less than their male counterparts, and the pay discrepancy is even \nmore dire for women of color.  The gender wage gap not only hurts working families, it also \nundermines the Administration's commitment to expand opportunity for all Americans. \n  \nThe Paycheck Fairness Act represents a significant step forward to address pay disparities and \nother obstacles that continue to harm the advancement of women in our economy.  For example, \nthe legislation would enhance the enforcement of equal pay laws by prohibiting retaliation \nagainst employees who ask about or discuss wage information, and by providing more effective \nremedies for women subjected to discriminatory pay practices.  S. 2199 would strengthen the \nEqual Pay Act by closing judicially-created loopholes for employer defenses and by bringing its \nclass action rules into conformity with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  S. 2199 would also \nstrengthen the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's enforcement of laws prohibiting \npay discrimination, and facilitate voluntary employer compliance, by requiring the collection of \npay data. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nSeptember 18, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 3102 \u2013 Nutrition Reform and Work Opportunity Act of 2013  \n(Rep.

These cuts would affect a broad array of Americans who are struggling \nto make ends meet, including working families with children, senior citizens, veterans, and \nadults who are still looking for work.

Further, provisions of the bill would disregard or reduce public engagement on a \nrange of community interests, including natural resource protections, and preclude agencies from \nconsidering less environmentally detrimental alternatives. \n \nMost significantly, H.R. 2954 would:  (1) waive all Federal laws, including those that require \nconsultation with Federal, State, local, or tribal governments or with local residents, in order to \nexpedite timber harvests on certain Federal lands in California; (2) reverse course on the science-\nbased National Park Service plan, developed after a lengthy public engagement process, that \nprovides an appropriate balance of off-road vehicle access and protection of sensitive seashore \nareas in North Carolina; and (3) waive review under the National Environmental Policy Act for \ncertain actions, weakening important public involvement and planning provisions for actions \naffecting resources such as grazing on lands managed by the Department of the Interior. \n \nAmong other concerns, the bill would:  (1) remove the protection for lands that provide natural \nstorm barriers vital to wildlife habitat and public recreation in Florida; (2) set a troubling \nprecedent for the management of the use of hand-propelled vessels in Yellowstone and Grand \nTetons National Parks; and (3) convey a Federal interest in land in downtown Anchorage, \nAlaska, without compensation to the U.S. Treasury. \n \nThe Administration supports provisions that would allow for the operation of the Green \nMountain Lookout in Washington State.  Further, the Administration supports restoration of the \nChesapeake Bay and looks forward to working with Congress to perfect related provisions.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nJuly 10, 2013 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 1238 \u2013 Keep Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013 \n(Senator Reed, D-RI, and 43 cosponsors) \n \nOn July 1st, due to lack of Congressional action, the interest rate on new subsidized Federal \nDirect Stafford Loans for undergraduate students doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.  As \nthe economy continues to recover, and at a time when market interest rates are near historic lows, \nmore than seven million students who rely on these loans to finance postsecondary education \nshould not be burdened with additional college debt as they seek to graduate, launch a career or a \nbusiness, start a family, or buy a house. \n \nThe Congress must act immediately to reverse the doubling of interest rates on student loans.  \nThe Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1238, the Keep Student Loans \nAffordable Act, because it meets the test of restoring student interest rates to the lower levels and \nwould apply to all loans first disbursed after June 30, even loans already disbursed, saving seven \nmillion students nearly $1,000 per student and giving the Congress time to pass a long-term \nsolution.  Like the proposal in the President's FY 2014 Budget, this bill would give students the \ncertainty of fixed interest rates, would not raise student loan interest rates for deficit reduction, \nand would support low- and middle-income students who struggle most to afford a college \neducation.  \n \nThe Administration remains committed to working with the Congress on a bipartisan approach to \na long-term solution that will help students and families afford higher education now and in the \nfuture, will not raise student rates to reduce the deficit, and will provide students protection \nagainst unaffordable loan balances and market uncertainties in the years to come.  The \nAdministration remains committed to making college more affordable and attainable for \nAmerican families, by maintaining a robust level of funding for the Pell Grant and supporting \ngreater repayment options to help borrowers meet their financial obligations as they leave school. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nDecember 10, 2014 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nS. 2244 -- Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014 \n(Sen.

However, the \nAdministration has serious concerns with the substitute amendment to the Senate-passed \nversion of S. 2244 considered by the House Rules Committee.  The Administration strongly \nopposes the inclusion of modifications to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act, specifically the end user provision, in this TRIA-related bill that has broad \nbipartisan support.  Broadening Dodd-Frank\u2019s statutory exemptions is a complicated issue with \nserious implications for the health and stability of the Nation\u2019s financial markets.  The main \npurpose of S. 2244 is to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; this bill should not \nbe used as a vehicle to add entirely unrelated financial regulatory provisions. \nThe Administration supports the policy goals of Title II, which would establish a National \nAssociation of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) as a mechanism for individuals and \ncompanies that sell insurance to be licensed to sell insurance in States other than their home State \nwithout having to be separately licensed in each State. The Administration, however, is \nconcerned that the bill provides a process for conducting criminal history records checks on \nindividuals applying to become members of NARAB that is inconsistent with the normal process \nthe FBI uses to conduct thousands of such background checks. The Administration believes the \nbill can be made consistent with current law in order to assure the benefits of an efficient and \neffective established process.  \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nNovember 12, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 982 - Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency (FACT) Act of 2013 \n(Rep.

The legislation is based \non the false assertion that there is endemic fraud in the asbestos trust system. \n \nThe bill\u2019s mandatory reporting and disclosure requirements would threaten asbestos victims\u2019 \nprivacy when they seek payment for injuries from an asbestos bankruptcy trust.

The Administration appreciates the efforts by the bill \nauthors to address concerns raised by the Administration regarding H.R. 3964, the Sacramento-\nSan Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act.  However, because H.R. 5781 makes \noperational determinations regarding the use of limited water resources during the ongoing \ndrought, and contains many new provisions that could lead to unintended consequences or \nfurther litigation, the Administration cannot support the bill in its current form. \nThe Administration takes seriously the ongoing drought that has affected communities, \nproducers and water users across much of the country, including the especially hard hit State of \nCalifornia. Since the President\u2019s visit to Fresno, California earlier this year the Administration \nhas undertaken a number of steps to help those most affected by drought. The U.S. Department \nof Agriculture has directed millions of dollars in food, conservation and emergency water \nassistance to tens of thousands of residents in areas hardest hit by drought. The Bureau of \nReclamation has provided cost-share assistance for nine water reclamation and reuse projects in \nthe State as well as millions of dollars in grants to build long-term resiliency to drought. \nMoreover, the President has directed Federal agencies to work with state and local officials in \nreal-time to maximize limited water supplies, prioritize public health and safety, meet state water \nquality requirements, and ensure a balanced approach to providing for the water needs of people, \nagriculture, businesses, power, imperiled species and the environment.  Among other things, \nthese efforts took form in a 2014 Drought Operations Plan, prepared in close coordination with \nthe State, and the Administration is already taking steps to prepare a new drought plan for 2015 \nbased on lessons learned and the best available science during the current year.  \nH.R. 5781 was introduced on December 2 and is being considered in the few remaining days of \nthis session without a hearing or opportunity for the public to review and provide comment.  In \nparticular, the bill appears to include a number of potentially conflicting mandates which can \ncreate confusion and undermine environmental laws, making it ripe for future litigation.  Given \nthe complexity of California water issues, policy determinations over the use of scarce water \nresources should be developed in an open and transparent manner, with an ability for the public, \naffected stakeholders, and Federal, state and local officials to review and provide comment and \nfeedback.  The Administration stands ready to work with Congress in this regard. \nFor these reasons, if the President were presented with H.R. 5781, his senior advisors \nwould recommend that he veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n   \n \nOctober 4, 2013  \n(House)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nLimited Appropriations Resolutions, 2014 \n(Rep.

Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4870, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes.  \nThe Administration appreciates the bill's continued support for providing funding that assists the \nwarfighter in operating in unconventional and irregular warfare and countering unconventional \nthreats, supports capacity-building efforts with foreign military forces, and supports on-going \noperations, as well as the support for programs that would improve the health and well-being of \nthe force, including sexual assault prevention.  While there are a number of areas of agreement \nwith the bill, the Administration has serious concerns with provisions that would constrain the \nability of the Department of Defense (DOD) to align military capabilities and force structure with \nthe President's defense strategy and to reduce unneeded costs.   \n \nThe Administration will soon submit a budget amendment to request funding for Overseas \nContingency Operations (OCO).  This request will reflect the President\u2019s decision on troop levels \nin Afghanistan and include funding for the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan, DOD's \nsupporting presence in the broader region, as well as the recently proposed Counterterrorism \nPartnerships Fund and European Reassurance Initiative.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress on this request. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations \nprocess that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding \nunnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include \nreconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and \nnational security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an \norderly appropriations process.  \n \nThe President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to \naccelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our \nnational security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same \ntime, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to \ndeliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.   \n \nThe President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan \nBudget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels.  However, \nthe levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation \nand are not sufficient\u2013either in FY 2015 or beyond\u2013to ensure the Nation is achieving its full \npotential.  For that reason, the Budget also includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and  Security Initiative\u2013evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities\u2013that presents \nadditional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The \nOpportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would provide $26.4 billion for DOD to make \nprogress on restoring readiness lost under sequestration, accelerate modernization of key \nweapons systems, and improve DOD facilities across the United States. \n \nIn the Administration's view, the risk to the Nation will grow significantly should the Congress \nnot accept reforms proposed in the FY 2015 Budget.  Without congressional support for \nmeaningful compensation reforms and other cost saving measures, force structure changes, and \nflexibility to manage weapon systems and infrastructure, there is an increased risk to the \nDepartment's ability to implement the President's defense strategy, which will contribute to a \nmilitary that will be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.   \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve these issues during the FY \n2015 appropriations process.   \n \nDepartment of Defense \n \nProhibition on Retirement, Divesture, Realignment, or Transfer of Aircraft.  The Administration \nappreciates the Committee's support of the Air Force's A-10 fleet divesture plans.  Divesting the \nA-10 fleet will help the Air Force meet near-term readiness and achieve long-term modernization \nobjectives.  However, the Administration strongly objects to provisions that restrict the \nDepartment's ability to retire other weapon systems and aircraft platforms in accordance with \ncurrent strategic and operational plans.  These divestitures are critical and would provide funding \nfor higher priority programs. \n \nSpecifically, the Administration strongly objects to sections 8122, 8133, and 8136 of the bill, \nconsistent with previously stated objections to provisions in the FY 2015 National Defense \nAuthorization Act.  Section 8122 of the bill would prohibit the cancellation or modification of \nthe C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  DOD plans to replace the C-130 AMP with \na less expensive, fully capable alternative that has been validated by independent study to ensure \nthat the fleet continues to meet future requirements.  Section 8133 would prevent the Air Force \nfrom using funds to divest or to disestablish any units of the active or reserve component \nassociated with E-3 airborne warning and control system aircraft.  This provision would force the \nAir Force to take funding from higher priority defense needs in order to operate, sustain, and \nmaintain aircraft that are not needed and are unaffordable in today's constrained fiscal \nenvironment.  Section 8136, which limits the transfer of Apaches from the Army National Guard \nto the active Army, would result in gaps in the Army's armed reconnaissance units that would \nrequire approximately $4 billion to fill.  As DOD transitions out of a decade of war, aircraft force \nstructure changes are necessary to shape a force that is more agile and ready to respond to the \nrequirements of the defense strategy.   \n \nCompensation Reform.  To achieve a proper balance between DOD's obligation to provide \ncompetitive pay and benefits to servicemembers and its responsibility to provide troops with the \ntraining and equipment they need to do their jobs, it is imperative to slow the growth of basic pay \nand housing allowances, modernize military healthcare, and reform how commissaries operate.  \nThe Administration strongly urges the Congress to support these reforms, which would save $2 \n2  billion in FY 2015 and $31 billion through FY 2019.  While the Committee restored funding to \noffset the FY 2015 savings associated with proposals that were not supported, the rejection of \nthese proposals will likely require DOD to find over $27 billion in additional reductions to \nreadiness, modernization, and force structure for FY 2016 through FY 2019.  The Administration \nlooks forward to the recommendations of the Military Compensation and Retirement \nModernization Commission on long-term compensation and retirement issues, but delaying \nDOD's holistic package of proposed initial changes will only result in increased costs, \ndegradation in training and modernization efforts, and risks to the force.  \n \nGuant\u00e1namo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 8107, 8108, \n8139, and 9015 of the bill, each of which would restrict the Executive Branch's ability to manage \nthe Guant\u00e1namo detainee population.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of \nthese or similar provisions in prior legislation and this year has reiterated his call to the Congress \nto lift such restrictions.  As the President said in his State of the Union Address, \"this needs to be \nthe year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at \nGuant\u00e1namo Bay.\"  Operating the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo weakens our national security \nby draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening \nviolent extremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive \nBranch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to \ndetermine when and where to prosecute Guant\u00e1namo detainees based on the facts and \ncircumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Sections 8107, 8139, and 9015 \nwould, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain \ncircumstances.   \n \nBase Realignment and Closure (BRAC).  The Administration strongly objects to the proposed \n$4.8 million reduction in funds that would support a BRAC 2017 round.  This impairs the ability \nof the Executive Branch to plan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would \nimprove military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress \nto provide the BRAC authorization and funding as requested, which would allow DOD to \nrightsize its infrastructure while providing important assistance to affected communities.  \nWithout authorization for a new round of BRAC, DOD will not be able to properly align the \nmilitary's infrastructure with the needs of our evolving force structure, which is critical to \nensuring that limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and \nnational security.   \n \nLimitation on Funds Available to Procure Equipment.  The Administration objects to section \n8116 of the bill which would continue and expand prohibitions on using funds to procure certain \nequipment, including maintenance for the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).  This \nsection would severely limit DOD's ability to sustain military-use helicopters and other \nequipment that is already in ANSF's inventory and is critical to their ability to continue the fight \nagainst extremists who threaten the security of Afghanistan, the United States, and our allies.  If \nenacted, this section could force DOD to seek more costly alternatives than contracting with the \nRussian helicopter industry to sustain ANSF aircraft, increasing costs to the U.S. taxpayer.   \n \nLiquid Rocket Engine Development.  The Administration objects to the unrequested $220 million \nfor a new rocket engine.  An independent study recently concluded that such a program would \ntake eight years to field and could cost $1.5 billion with another $3 billion needed to develop a \nsuitable launch vehicle.  This approach prematurely commits significant resources and would not \n3  reduce our reliance on Russian engines for at least a decade.  With a goal of promptly reducing \nour reliance on Russian technology, the Administration is evaluating several cost-effective \noptions including public-private partnerships with multiple awards that will drive innovation, \nstimulate the industrial base, and reduce costs through competition.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress on this issue once the analysis is complete.  \n \nLimitations on Phased Modernization of Weapon Systems.  While appreciative of the bill's \noverall support for cruiser modernization, the Administration objects to the unnecessary \nlimitations on the current plan, which would preclude modernization in the most cost effective \nand timely manner and may hinder the Navy's ability to retain 11 modernized cruisers into the \n2040s.   \n \nReducing the Force Structure at Lajes Air Force Base.  The Administration objects to section \n8123 of the bill, which would prohibit the Secretary of the Air Force from reducing the force \nstructure at Lajes Air Force Base and is duplicative of section 341 of the FY 2014 National \nDefense Authorization Act.  Because DOD is nearing completion of the section 341 requirements \nfor Lajes, duplicating and amplifying these requirements is unnecessarily onerous.   \n \nLittoral Combat Ship (LCS).  The Administration objects to funding reductions for the LCS \nprogram.  The reductions leave the program with insufficient funds to procure three LCS in  \nFY 2015, delaying the delivery of much needed capability to the Fleet.  Deferring additional \nships into FY 2016 would compound the already significant challenges the Navy faces in funding \nthe shipbuilding account in a fiscally constrained environment while increasing overall costs to \nthe Navy and increasing risk to the industrial base, including sub-tier suppliers. \n \nReallocation of Missile Defense Agency Funding.  The Administration objects to the reallocation \nof $370 million from the FY 2015 Budget request.  These changes would reduce capability and \ncapacity, and may possibly hinder the Department's ability to effectively manage the Agency.  \nSpecifically, this reallocation of funds would delay critical engineering, testing, command and \ncontrol, and weapons system development, and would affect homeland and regional \ncommitments, including a likely delay of one year for the European Phased Adaptive Approach \nPhase 3 \u2013 a national commitment to our allies.  Also, the reduction in advanced procurement \nfunding for the Standard Missile-3 IB could increase its planned procurement cost by about $140 \nmillion.   \n \nOpposition to Unrequested Funding.  The Administration objects to the billions of dollars \nprovided for items DOD did not request and does not need, such as additional EA-18G aircraft, \nHigh Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, M-1 Abrams upgrades, and a significantly larger \namount of funding for the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account than provided in \nrecent years.  The Administration is also concerned that section 8006 of the bill makes spending \non these and other unnecessary items statutorily required, diverting scarce resources from more \nimportant defense programs and limiting the Secretary's flexibility to manage the Department \nefficiently.   \n \nClassified Programs.  The Administration looks forward to providing its views on the \nadjustments contained in the Classified Annex to the bill once it becomes available.  \n \n4  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n5  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n) \n  June 3, 2013 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2217 \u2014 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2014  \n(Rep.

These cuts could result in hundreds of \nthousands of low-income children losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of \nchildren with disabilities losing Federal funding for their special education teachers and aides, \nthousands of Federal agents who can\u2019t enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend \nfugitives, and thousands of scientists without medical grants, which would slow research that \ncould lead to new treatments and cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s, and hurt \nAmerica\u2019s economic competitiveness.  \n \nPrior to consideration of appropriations bills the Congress should complete an appropriate \nframework for all the appropriations bills.  More than a month has passed since the deadline for \naction and the Congress has yet to appoint conferees and agree on a budget resolution. \n \nUnless this bill passes the Congress in the context of an overall budget framework that supports \nour recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and \nnational security for our economy to compete in the future, the President\u2019s senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto H.R. 2217 and any other legislation that implements the House \nRepublican Budget framework. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill.   \n \nDisaster Relief Funding.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's funding level for the \nDisaster Relief Fund, including $595 million for base program activity and $5.6 billion provided \nas a disaster relief cap adjustment made pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011. \n \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  The Administration is disappointed that the \nCommittee does not fully fund the President\u2019s request for 1,600 new Customs and Border  Protection officers and does not include a provision allowing for additional officers through \nincreased customs and immigration inspection user fees.  The addition of these officers to the \nCBP workforce would promote travel and tourism by reducing wait times for travelers and cargo \nentering the country, in turn stimulating domestic employment and strengthening the economy.   \n \nCybersecurity.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s continued support for important \nFederal cybersecurity initiatives, including the EINSTEIN program and continuous monitoring \nof Federal networks for malicious cyber activity.  \n \nTransportation Security Administration.  The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s failure to \nreform the aviation passenger fee as proposed in the President\u2019s FY 2014 Budget. \n \nNational Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF).  The Administration objects to incremental \nfunding of the NBAF project.  NBAF is anticipated to be a national asset critical to the protection \nof the Nation\u2019s food supply.  The partial funding provided in the bill will delay construction of \nNBAF, increase project costs, and leave a significant vulnerability unaddressed.  Long-standing \nprocurement policy prohibits incremental funding because it undermines program stability and \nruns counter to sound budgeting principles and fiscal discipline. \n \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  The Administration appreciates the support \nprovided for investigations of human trafficking and intellectual property rights violations.  \nHowever, the Administration opposes the Committee's decision to fund 2,200 unrequested \ndetention beds.  The Administration encourages the Congress to focus detention capabilities on \npriority and mandatory detainees, while continuing to increase support for ICE\u2019s Alternative to \nDetention program, which has consistently helped to ensure low-risk individuals in removal \nproceedings appear for hearings and comply with removal orders at a lower per-day cost than \ndetention.  The Administration also objects to the funding provided above the FY 2014 Budget \nrequest for the 287(g) program, since Secure Communities is more consistent, efficient, and cost-\neffective in identifying and removing criminal and other priority aliens than the 287(g) program, \nand has been deployed nationwide.  \n \nU.S. Coast Guard.  The Administration objects to incremental funding for Coast Guard \nacquisition of National Security Cutter (NSC)-7 and NSC-8 and rescinding FY 2013 \nappropriations for shore support needs for NSC-6.  Although the Administration supports Coast \nGuard\u2019s acquisition of NSC-7, long-standing procurement policy prohibits incremental funding \nbecause it undermines program stability and runs counter to sound budgeting principles and \nfiscal discipline. \n \nDepartmental Management.  The Administration opposes the lack of funding for the Department \nof Homeland Security (DHS) headquarters consolidation project, which will delay the \ndevelopment and occupancy of the St. Elizabeths campus. \n \nCivilian Pay Raise.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent \npay increase for Federal civilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a \npermanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable. \n \nState and Local Grant Programs.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee continues \nto provide some flexibility to the Secretary of Homeland Security to award grants, as authorized \n2  in FY 2013, and encourages the House to adopt all of the flexibilities requested in the President\u2019s \nFY 2014 Budget for the National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP). \n \nProhibition on Immigration from Brazil.  The Administration objects to a provision in the bill \nthat seeks to prohibit legal immigration from Brazil.  The punitive language prevents the \nprocessing of family- and employment-sponsored immigration petitions as well as for any \nhumanitarian applications such as for asylum, refugee status, or Violence Against Women Act-\nrelated immigration protection. \n \nAbortion-Related Provisions.  The Administration strongly opposes sections 564, 565, and 566 \nof the bill that purport to limit the use of Federal funds for providing or facilitating abortion \nservices.  Longstanding Federal policy prohibits Federal funds from being used for these \nservices, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  \nCurrent DHS practice does not compel employees to perform or facilitate them, or permit \nFederal funds to be used to acquire these services except in cases where a pregnancy is the result \nof rape, incest, or threatens the life of the woman. \n \nConstitutional Concerns     \n \nThe Administration strongly objects to and has constitutional concerns about the provisions of \nsection 533 that limit the use of funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee \ntransfers.  Although the Administration opposes the release of detainees within the United States, \nsection 533 undermines our national security and raises significant separation of powers \nconcerns.  This provision unnecessarily constrains the Nation's counterterrorism efforts, \nparticularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 option for incapacitating \ndangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have leveraged the \nflexibility and strength of this country\u2019s Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous terrorists and \ngather critical intelligence.  The continued prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an \nessential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available \noption.  Such restrictions or interferences would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional \nseparation of powers principles.  \n \nAdditionally, Section 512 purports to prevent funds from being used to exercise supervisory \ncontrol over preparation of certain reports by the Privacy Officer of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.  This provision implicates separation of powers concerns by imposing a potentially \nmaterial practical burden on the President's effective supervision and management of the \nExecutive Branch.  The Administration urges that it be deleted. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations \nprocess moves forward.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n3  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \n  June 9, 2014 \n  (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 4745 \u2014 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2015 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4745, making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes.  The bill fails to make needed \ninvestments in our Nation's infrastructure, provides insufficient support for critical housing \nprograms for low-income Americans and the homeless, and includes objectionable language \nprovisions.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations \nprocess that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding \nunnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include \nreconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and \nnational security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an \norderly appropriations process.  \n \nThe President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to \naccelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our \nnational security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same \ntime, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to \ndeliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.   \n \nThe President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan \nBudget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels.  However, \nthe levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation \nand are not sufficient \u2013 either in FY 2015 or beyond \u2013 to ensure the Nation is achieving its full \npotential.  For that reason, the Budget also includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and \nSecurity Initiative \u2013 evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities \u2013 that presents \nadditional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The \nOpportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would support a number of investments, including \nadditional funding to revitalize neighborhoods of concentrated poverty and assist public housing \nresidents to secure gainful employment, and funding for grants to promote more integrated \nhousing and transportation investments.  Further, through its fully paid for GROW AMERICA \nAct proposal, the Administration has requested $302 billion over four years for highways, transit, \nhighway safety, and rail programs, as well as for Transportation Investment Generating \nEconomic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.  The Administration looks forward to working with the \nCongress to fund critical investments to rebuild our transportation infrastructure, create jobs, and \ngrow the economy.   \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve these issues during the \nFY 2015 appropriations process. \n \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) \n \nSurface Transportation Funding.  The Administration looks forward to working with the \nCongress to enact the GROW AMERICA Act proposal.  The legislation would provide $302 \nbillion over four years for highways, transit, highway safety, and rail programs, as well as for \nTIGER grants, and is paid for by pro-growth business tax reforms.  There is bipartisan agreement \nthat more funding is needed to improve infrastructure in order to allow people and goods to \nmove safely and efficiently through the Nation.  The Committee's proposed funding level, which \nfreezes obligation limitations for highway, transit, and highway safety at FY 2014 authorized \nlevels, demonstrates why a robust, multi-year authorization is essential to provide the funding \nboost that States and municipalities require to make the necessary and transformative \ntransportation investments that their citizens are demanding.   \n \nNational Infrastructure Investments.  The Administration urges the Congress to increase funding \nfor TIGER grants to a level sufficient to support innovative projects across the Nation. The \nfunding level provided in the bill is a $500 million reduction below the FY 2014 enacted levels \nand would reduce an already highly competitive grant program and its ability to support \ninnovative projects across the United States.  Further, the Committee's decision to eliminate \ngrant funding eligibility for transit and passenger rail projects would stifle the multimodal \ninnovation TIGER has helped spur since the program's inception.  \n \nFederal Transit Administration (FTA) Capital Investment (New Starts) Grants.  The \nAdministration urges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $2.5 billion for FTA \nCapital Investment New Starts.  The funding provided in the bill would only fund payments on \ncurrent projects and not allow FTA to initiate new grant agreements with communities whose \nprojects have demonstrated merit through the pipeline.  \n \nHigh-Performance Passenger Rail.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's \nreduction of $200 million below the FY 2014 funding level for passenger rail programs, which \nwould result in significant delays in much needed capital investments and contribute to \ndeteriorating performance.  As proposed in the GROW AMERICA Act, the Administration \nbelieves that the Congress should be investing in high-performance passenger rail service to \nmeet the transportation needs of our growing population.  In addition to providing grant funds to \nimprove passenger rail service at the national and state level and to help commuter railroads \ninstall positive train control systems, the Administration's proposal would also restructure \nFederal support for Amtrak to increase transparency, accountability, and performance.   \n \nHigh Speed Rail.  The Administration strongly objects to prohibiting the Surface Transportation \nBoard from taking any action to approve subsequent phases of the California High Speed Rail \nproject between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  The Administration believes passenger rail can \nplay an important role in addressing transportation needs and opposes any attempts to limit state \nand local choices to enhance passenger rail. \n \n2  Safe Transport of Energy Products.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee did not \nprovide the requested $40 million proposed in the FY 2015 Budget to support the multimodal \nprevention and response activities associated with the increased safety issues surrounding the \ntransport of crude oil.  However, the Administration appreciates that the Committee provided the \nrequested funding level of $52 million in the FY 2015 Budget for the Hazardous Materials \nSafety account.  Though not intended to address the safe transport issue exclusively, it is a step \ntoward funding the additional research, training, and outreach associated with the recent surge in \noil and natural gas transportation.  \n \nInfrastructure Permitting Center.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee did not \nprovide the requested funding level for the interagency permitting center, which is essential to \nmodernizing and streamlining the Federal permitting and review process, reducing the time it \ntakes to start infrastructure projects while improving outcomes for the environment.  The \nrequested funding supports key reforms in the Administration\u2019s comprehensive plan, announced \nby the President last month, which that includes 15 reforms and nearly 100 actions to \nsignificantly improve Federal permitting to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity, and \nimprove the competitiveness of the American economy. Expanding permitting reform \nGovernment-wide to build a 21st century infrastructure is also a critical component of the \nPresident\u2019s Management Agenda, aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nFederal Government.   \n \nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nsupport for FAA, including funding to hire and train additional safety inspectors and keep \nmodernization of the air traffic control system on track. \n \nHighway and Motor Carrier Safety.  The Administration objects to the provisions altering the \npermissible size and weight of trucks operating over Federal highways in the states of \nMississippi, Wisconsin and Idaho.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress \nin the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), the Department of Transportation is currently conducting a \ncomprehensive truck size and weight limits study.  Any reconsideration of size and weight limits \nshould be done on a comprehensive basis with full consideration of the infrastructure and safety \nimpacts as informed by the MAP-21 study.  The Administration opposes provisions that serve to \nweaken highway safety by altering or revising the existing safety regulations for motor carrier \noperators. \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nHousing Choice Vouchers.  The Administration is deeply concerned about the funding level \nprovided for the Housing Choice Vouchers program.  The funding level in the bill is insufficient \nto provide the same level of assistance to families as in 2014 and would not restore the \nsequestration cut.  The Administration also strongly urges the Congress to fund the Voucher \nprogram\u2019s administrative fees at the President's request of $1.7 billion so that Public Housing \nAuthorities can ensure that units are safe and habitable.    \n \nHomeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided \nfor Homeless Assistance Grants.  The bill funds the program at $2.1 billion, which is $301 \nmillion below the FY 2015 Budget, and would not allow for the development of any new \npermanent supportive housing as part of the Administration\u2019s efforts to end chronic \nhomelessness in 2016.  \n3   \nChoice Neighborhoods.  The Administration strongly opposes the $25 million funding level \nprovided for Choice Neighborhoods, which is $95 million below the FY 2015 Budget.  At this \nfunding level, Public Housing Authorities and other local entities will be extraordinarily limited \nin their ability to revitalize distressed HUD-assisted housing and build ladders of opportunity for \nlow-income families in surrounding high-poverty neighborhoods.  \n \nPublic Housing Programs.  The Administration opposes the $6.2 billion in funding provided for \nthe Public Housing Operating Fund and Capital Fund programs.  This funding level, which is \n$350 million below the FY 2015 Budget, may delay necessary maintenance and capital \nimprovements and expose low-income families to deteriorating living conditions.  The \nAdministration also urges the Congress to eliminate the 60,000 unit cap on the Rental Assistance \nDemonstration, as requested in the FY 2015 Budget, to preserve additional Public Housing \nproperties by converting them to long-term Section 8 contracts.  \n \nHomeowners Armed With Knowledge Demonstration Project (HAWK).  The Administration \nopposes section 232 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to implement the HAWK, a \nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) demonstration which combines housing counseling with \nFHA-insured mortgages to expand access to affordable mortgage credit for creditworthy \nborrowers.  The Administration also urges the Congress to adopt the proposed new fee for FHA \nadministrative expenses, which would lower taxpayer risks by enabling FHA to perform \nenhanced oversight of its lending partners.    \n \nHousing Counseling.  The Administration opposes the $47 million in funding provided for \nHUD's Housing Counseling program.  This funding level is $13 million, or 22 percent, below the \nFY 2015 Budget.  While the housing market has improved, there are still many households \nfacing the aftermath of the financial crisis and counseling is an important resource in helping \nhouseholds find affordable and stable housing.  \n \nHOME Investment Partnerships Program.  The Administration opposes the $700 million in \nfunding provided for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which is $250 million below \nthe FY 2015 Budget.  The Administration urges the Congress to support this program at the \nrequested level in order to increase the supply of affordable housing for low-income families.  \n \nHUD Information Technology (IT) Fund.  The Administration opposes the $100 million in \nfunding provided for the HUD IT Fund, which is $172 million below the FY 2015 Budget.  The \nAdministration urges the Congress to support the IT Fund at the requested level to ensure HUD \nhas sufficient resources to support its core IT needs; the level provided in the bill will inhibit \nHUD from carrying out its mission.   \n \nFair Housing.  The Administration opposes the $46 million in funding provided for the Fair \nHousing and Equal Opportunity program, which reflects a reduction of $25 million or 35 percent \nbelow the FY 2015 Budget.  This reduced funding level would severely curtail investigations of \nfair housing complaints and undermine efforts to support fair housing throughout the United \nStates.  \n \nLead Hazard Control.  The Administration opposes the $70 million in funding provided for Lead \nHazard Control and Healthy Homes grants, which is a reduction of $50 million or 42 percent \n4  below the FY 2015 Budget.  This reduction will leave thousands of low-income families with \nchildren at continued risk of exposure to lead-based paint hazards and other home health hazards. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations \nprocess moves forward.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n5  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \n                                                                                                                   February 25, 2014 \n                                                                                                           (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n  \nH.R. 2804 \u2013 ALERRT Act of 2013 \n(Rep. Holding, R- North Carolina, and 10 cosponsors) \nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, and that \nthey are tailored to advance statutory goals in a manner that is efficient and cost-effective, while \nminimizing uncertainty.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of \nH.R. 2804, the Achieving Less Excess in Regulation and Requiring Transparency (ALERRT) \nAct of 2014.  The bill would impose unneeded and costly analytical and procedural requirements \non agencies that would prevent them from performing their statutory responsibilities.  It would \nalso create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty, increase costs for businesses and State, \nlocal and tribal governments, and impede common-sense protections for the American public. \nThe ALERRT Act would impose unnecessary new procedures on agencies and invite frivolous \nlitigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, it already must adhere to the \nrequirements of the statute that it is implementing.  In many cases, the Congress has mandated \nthat the agency issue the particular rule or regulation, and it often prescribes the process that the \nagency must follow.  Agencies also must adhere to the robust and well-understood procedural \nrequirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act (RFA), the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), the Paperwork \nReduction Act (PRA), and the Congressional Review Act.  In addition, for decades, agency \nrulemaking has been guided by executive orders issued and followed by administrations of both \npolitical parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations only upon a \nreasoned determination that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs, to consider regulatory \nalternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  Final regulations are subject to review by the \nFederal courts which, among other things, examine whether agencies have satisfied the \nsubstantive and procedural requirements of all applicable statutes, and whether they have \nconsidered input from relevant stakeholders. \nWith respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act in particular, agencies already have in place \nprocedures and policies, as required by executive orders and other presidential directives, to \nensure that they take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.  This \nAdministration's commitment to promoting small businesses and ensuring that regulations do not \nunduly burden them also is reflected in Executive Order 13563, which requires agencies to \nexamine existing regulations and to eliminate, streamline, or alter them where they are \nexcessively burdensome. \nPassage of H.R. 2804 would replace this time-honored framework with layers of additional, \nunnecessary procedural requirements that would seriously undermine the ability of agencies to \nexecute their statutory mandates.  It would require cumbersome \u201cformal\u201d rulemaking for a new \ncategory of rules, for which agencies would have to conduct quasi-adjudicatory proceedings.  In \naddition, the bill would impose unnecessary new evidentiary standards as a condition of  rulemaking.  Finally, the bill would subject the regulatory process to unneeded rounds of \nlitigation, introduce redundant processes for litigation settlements, and require numerous, \ncumbersome layers of reporting. \nIf H.R. 2804 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill. \n* * * * * * \n \n \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n) \n  June 3, 2013 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2216 \u2013 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2014 \n(Rep.

These cuts could result in hundreds of \nthousands of low-income children losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of \nchildren with disabilities losing Federal funding for their special education teachers and aides, \nthousands of Federal agents who can\u2019t enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend \nfugitives, and thousands of scientists without medical grants, which would slow research that \ncould lead to new treatments and cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s, and hurt \nAmerica\u2019s economic competitiveness.  \n \nPrior to consideration of appropriations bills the Congress should complete an appropriate \nframework for all the appropriations bills.  More than a month has passed since the deadline for \naction and the Congress has yet to appoint conferees and agree on a budget resolution. \n \nUnless this bill passes the Congress in the context of an overall budget framework that supports \nour recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and \nnational security for our economy to compete in the future, the President\u2019s senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto H.R. 2216 and any other legislation that implements the House \nRepublican Budget framework. \n   \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill.   \n \nMilitary Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for critical \nmilitary construction projects but objects to the use of incremental funding for the Public Health \nCommand Lab Replacement project at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.  Incremental \nfunding of military construction projects runs counter to sound budgeting principles and fiscal \ndiscipline.   \nArlington National Cemetery (ANC).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued \nsupport for ANC programs, which will help the Cemetery achieve and maintain the highest \nstandards of service and accountability.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nsupport for the ANC Advisory Commission\u2019s efforts to meet future burial needs. \n \nCivilian Pay Raise.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the proposed 1.0 percent \npay increase for Federal civilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a \npermanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable. \n \nDetainee Matters.  The Administration strongly opposes section 413, which would prohibit the \nuse of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house \nindividuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This prohibition would constrain \nthe flexibility that the Nation's Armed Forces and counterterrorism professionals need to deal \nwith evolving threats, intruding upon the Executive Branch's ability to carry out its mission. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \nSeptember 11, 2013 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nS. 1392 - Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act \n                                           (Sen.

This bipartisan legislation would codify and enhance existing Federal programs, further \nsupporting successful efforts to reduce energy waste through building energy codes and \nindustrial energy efficiency programs and by identifying efficiency opportunities in Federal \nbuildings.  S. 1392 complements key energy efficiency dimensions of the President\u2019s Climate \nAction Plan that will work to cut carbon pollution and begin to slow the effects of climate \nchange, so that we can leave a cleaner and more stable environment for future generations. \n \nEnergy efficiency is a large, low\u2010cost, and underutilized U.S. energy resource.  Increased energy \nefficiency offers savings on energy bills, opportunities for more jobs, and improved industrial \ncompetitiveness, and it will lower air pollution.  The Administration strongly supports improving \nenergy efficiency in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors and in the Federal \ngovernment.   \n \nS. 1392 would build on the momentum established by the Administration\u2019s \u201call of the above\u201d \nenergy strategy, supporting the President\u2019s goal to cut in half the energy wasted by U.S. homes \nand businesses by 2030.  From supporting States and local governments with American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act investments (which has led to over one million homes being \nweatherized and to other local energy efficiency improvements), to partnering with companies \nand businesses to reduce their energy bills through the Better Buildings Initiative, to Federal \nadministrative actions to cut energy use across Federal facilities, the Administration is \ncommitted to winning the future by catalyzing a homegrown, clean energy economy in the \nUnited States.   \n \nS. 1392 will support the Administration\u2019s efforts to strengthen U.S. competitiveness through \nsignificant research and development investments in manufacturing innovation and productivity, \nsuch as the Department of Energy\u2019s recently launched Clean Energy Manufacturing \nInitiative.  This initiative focuses on growing U.S. manufacturing of clean energy products, \nboosting U.S. manufacturing competitiveness across the board by increasing manufacturing \nenergy productivity, and providing training and technical assistance for manufacturers.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on this bipartisan \nlegislation to support energy efficiency and boost U.S. competitiveness and job creation. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \nJuly 10, 2013 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2642\u2014Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013  \n(Rep.

The \nbill impedes implementation of the Affordable Care Act, undermines critical components of Wall \nStreet reform, and fails to provide the resources necessary to provide robust taxpayer services and \nimprove tax enforcement.

However, \nthe levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation \nand are not sufficient\u2014either in FY 2015 or beyond\u2014to ensure the Nation is achieving its full \npotential.  For that reason, the Budget also includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and \nSecurity Initiative\u2014evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities\u2014that presents \nadditional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The \nOpportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would support a number of investments, including \nadditional resources to improve customer service at the Internal Revenue Service and to provide \nmore useful public reporting of Federal spending data.   \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve these issues during the \nFY 2015 appropriations process. \n  Department of the Treasury \n \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS).  The Administration strongly opposes the $1.5 billion reduction \nin funding for the IRS compared to the FY 2015 Budget request.  Reverting the agency's funding \nlevel to FY 2008 levels would hinder IRS efforts to provide robust service to taxpayers, improve \nenforcement operations, and implement new statutory responsibilities.  Further, these reductions \nwould impact efforts aimed at deficit reduction, as funding for IRS enforcement activities returns \nmany times its cost in the form of increased revenue collections.  Additionally, the \nAdministration strongly opposes sections of the bill that limit IRS funding and transfers to carry \nout implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), through which millions of individuals \nhave signed up for coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplaces.  The Administration \nalso objects to provisions that unnecessarily encumber IRS operations with reporting \nrequirements and unduly restrict the IRS's ability to finalize regulations.  \n \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions Fund Program (CDFI).  The Administration \nappreciates the support for CDFI, which is funded at $230 million, $5.1 million above the \nFY 2015 Budget request.  However, the Administration is disappointed that within the total, the \nbill does not provide the $35 million requested for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, which \nis designed to increase the availability of affordable, healthy food outlets in underserved urban \nand rural communities.  The Administration is also disappointed that the bill does not provide for \nthe requested continuation of the CDFI Bond Guarantee program beyond FY 2014; the program \nrequires no additional funding and serves as a source of much needed long-term capital in \nunderserved and economically disadvantaged communities.   \n  \nDepartmental Offices and Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.  The Administration \nobjects to the $28 million reduction in funding from the FY 2015 Budget request for \nDepartmental Offices Salaries and Expenses.  This level would unreasonably impinge on the \nability of the Department to carry out its core mission of providing leadership in economic and \nfiscal policy.  It would also fail to sufficiently fund the Department's administration and \nimplementation of the new Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, which could significantly delay \ngrant awards to the five affected States.  The Administration also objects to the creation of a new \nindependent account for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which contributes to \nthe reduction in resources available for other management functions.  \n \nOffice of Financial Research (OFR).  The Administration opposes language in the bill that would \nsubject OFR to the annual appropriations process beginning in FY 2016 and could limit the \nagency's ability to develop critical market analysis if funding shortfalls prevent information \ntechnology investments or hiring of highly-skilled staff.   \n \nMultilateral Development Bank (MDB) Restrictions.  The Administration opposes language in \nthe bill that prohibits the use of funds for the enforcement of any rule, regulation, policy, or \nguideline related to the Department of the Treasury's Guidance for U.S. Positions on MDBs \nEngaging with Developing Countries on Coal-Fired Power Generation.  This language is counter \nto Administration efforts to limit support for coal-fired power plants and to reduce carbon \nemissions.    \n \n \n \n2  Executive Office of the President (EOP) \n \nEOP Funding.  The Administration strongly opposes the reduction in funding for Salaries and \nExpenses among the components within the EOP, which is $3 million below the FY 2014 \nenacted level, and $7 million below the FY 2015 Budget request.  The Administration strongly \nobjects to the proposed reduction for the President's Council of Economic Advisers, which would \nlimit CEA's ability to monitor the state of the economy and develop policies that will promote \neconomic growth.  The Administration also strongly objects to the absence of any funding for \nUnanticipated Needs.  Without any funding, the President's flexibility to meet unanticipated \nneeds for the furtherance of the national interest, security, or defense is severely hampered. \n \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB).  The Administration strongly opposes the funding \nlevel in the bill for OMB, which is $4 million below the FY 2015 Budget request, as well as the \nunnecessary withholding of $52 million of OMB resources until the FY 2016 Budget request is \nsubmitted to the Congress.  The Administration objects to bill language that would require \nburdensome OMB cost estimates to accompany the issuance of all Executive orders, as well as \nlanguage that would require OMB to submit to the Congress a burdensome and duplicative report \nof limited value estimating the costs of implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.    \n \nProhibition on Paying Salaries and Expenses.  The Administration objects to section 621 of the \nbill would impinge on the President's ability to organize EOP operations by continuing a \nprohibition on paying salaries and expenses for certain White House staff positions.   \n \nGeneral Services Administration (GSA) \n \nFederal Buildings Fund.  The Administration strongly opposes the lack of funding for the \nFederal Buildings Fund, which is $787 million less than the FY 2015 Budget request.  At the \nlevel provided, the bill fails to sufficiently fund the GSA capital program, eliminating priority \nnew construction and repair and alteration projects.  The bill's funding level also fails to \nsufficiently fund the operating activities and could force the Government to default on its rent \nobligation to private sector lessors.    \n \nElectronic Government (E-Gov) Fund Consolidation.  The Administration appreciates the \ncombined level of funding and authorities for GSA's E-Gov Fund and Federal Citizen Services \nFund (FCSF).  Increased availability of access to the Internet has created opportunities to merge \nthe functions of the FCSF and the E-Gov Fund while improving the ability of the Federal \nGovernment to interact with citizens and businesses through improved Digital Services offerings.  \n \nAllowances and Office Staff for Former Presidents.  The Former Presidents Act of 1958 requires \nGSA to provide former Presidents with allowances and office staff, in addition to their pension \nand benefits, to carry out the duties associated with their former office.  The bill would fund this \nactivity at $1.7 million, half the requested level of $3.4 million, thereby limiting GSA's ability to \nfully support the former Presidents in the manner required by law.   \n \nSmall Business Administration (SBA) \n \nEntrepreneurial Development Programs.  While appreciative of the total funding provided for \nthe Entrepreneurial Development Programs in the bill, the Administration opposes the \n3  elimination of funding for Regional Innovation Cluster grants and Growth Accelerators, as well \nas the reduction of funding for Entrepreneurial Education below the level requested in the \nFY 2015 Budget.  These reductions would impede SBA's ongoing efforts to help regions \nleverage their unique assets to create jobs by turning entrepreneurial ideas into sustainable high-\ngrowth small businesses.   \n \nBusiness Loans Program.  The Administration appreciates the funding in the bill for SBA's \nbusiness loan programs at a level that would support over $29 billion in lending to small \nbusinesses in FY 2015.  The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to also include the \nrequested reauthorization of the 504 Loan Refinancing Program, which would allow thousands of \nbusinesses to refinance their debt into lower interest rate loans to open up cash flow for \ninvestments and other expenses at no cost to taxpayers.   \n \nDisaster Loans Program.  The Administration urges the Congress to utilize the disaster relief cap \nadjustment authorized in the Budget Control Act of 2011 to fund the $155 million request for \nSBA's administrative costs associated with major disasters.  By not utilizing the cap adjustment, \nthe bill makes unnecessary reductions to other programs to accommodate this line of support to \nsmall businesses after disaster.   \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Administration strongly objects to the funding \nlevel of $1.4 billion for the SEC, which is $300 million below the FY 2015 Budget request.  The \nbill also prohibits authorized spending from the agency's mandatory Reserve Fund, which would \nreduce the resources available to the SEC in FY 2015 by an additional $50 million.  At this \nfunding level, the SEC would be unable to add critical positions in market oversight, compliance, \nand enforcement to carry out its financial oversight responsibilities under the Wall Street Reform \nand Consumer Protection Act and other authorities.  The SEC is fee-funded and its funding level \nhas no impact on the deficit.   \n \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The Administration strongly opposes language \nin the bill that would subject CFPB funding to the appropriations process beginning in FY 2016.  \nDoing so would weaken the agency's essential independence and undermine its ability to \nconsistently serve the most vulnerable consumer populations.  The bill would also impose \nburdensome and unnecessary reporting requirements regarding the CFPB's funding and \noperations.  The CFPB already routinely testifies before the Congress on its budget and \nperformance, regularly posts financial reports on its website, and is arguably subject to greater \noversight than any other Federal financial regulator.  The additional reporting requirements this \nbill would impose on the agency are costly, duplicative, and provide no material benefit.   \n \nElection Assistance Commission (EAC).  The Administration opposes the elimination of funding \nfor EAC, which assists State and local entities with election administration and certifies voting \nequipment.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund EAC at the $10 million level \nincluded in the FY 2015 Budget request; $8.1 million for EAC and $1.9 million for related \nactivities performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.   \n \nFederal Communications Commission (FCC).  The Administration strongly objects to the \nreduction in funding in the bill for the FCC, which is funded $53 million below the FY 2015 \n4  Budget request and $17 million below the FY 2014 enacted level.  This funding level would \nundermine efforts at the FCC to modernize information technology systems, better map and \nanalyze spectrum usage to free up more bandwidth for commercial use, and continue needed \nreforms to the Universal Service Fund.   \n \nUnited States Postal Service.  The Administration is disappointed that language under the \nPayment to the Postal Service Fund account would prohibit the Postal Service from modifying its \ndelivery schedule to better adapt to its current business environment.   \n \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB).  The Administration appreciates the \nincrease to the PCLOB funding level over the FY 2014 enacted level, but is disappointed that the \nbill only provides $4.5 million, which is more than 40 percent below the FY 2015 Budget \nrequest.  At the funding level provided, PCLOB would be unable to hire the staff needed to \nperform effective and independent oversight of counterterrorism-related programs.   \n \nAdministrative Conference of the United States (ACUS).  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee's support for ACUS, which would help save taxpayer dollars through ACUS \nrecommendations.   \n \nDistrict of Columbia (D.C.)   \n \nLocal Budget and Local Legislative Autonomy.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt \nthe provisions requested in the FY 2015 Budget that allow D.C. to spend its own local taxes and \nother non-Federal funds without congressional approval, and that enable local legislation to take \neffect immediately upon adoption by the District government.   \n \nRestrictions on the District's Use of Local Funds.  The Administration strongly opposes language \nin the bill that restricts D.C. from using its local funds for abortion services, undermining the \nprinciple of States' rights and of District home rule.  Longstanding Federal policy already \nprohibits Federal funds from being used for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when \nthe life of the woman would be endangered.  Similarly, the Administration strongly opposes the \nlanguage in the bill preventing the District from using its own local funds to carry out locally-\npassed marijuana policies, which again undermines the principles of States' rights and of District \nhome rule.  Furthermore, the language poses legal challenges to the Metropolitan Police \nDepartment's enforcement of all marijuana laws currently in force in the District.   \n \nNeedle Exchange.  The Administration strongly opposes the restriction in the bill on the use of \nFederal funds for the District's needle exchange programs.  This is contrary to current law and the \nAdministration's policy to allow the use of funds in locations where local authorities deem needle \nexchange programs to be effective and appropriate.   \n \nEducation.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill compromises a statutorily-mandated \nevaluation of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) by requiring that funds be made \navailable to students in the control group of a multi-year, multi-million dollar Department of \nEducation study already underway.  This study is critical to evaluating the impact of OSP \nvouchers on the academic achievement of participating students.  The Administration also \nobjects to the bill's reduction of funding for D.C. Tuition Assistance Grants, which would \n5  severely limit assistance available to D.C. students attending public colleges across the United \nStates.   \n \nOther Provisions \n \nCuba Restriction.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that would prohibit \nfunding for non-academic educational exchanges to Cuba.  This language would result in a \nreduction of people-to-people interactions and as such is counter to the Administration's policy to \nincrease overall travel and the flow of information and resources to private Cubans.  This \nprovision is an unwarranted restriction on purposeful travel to Cuba.   \n \nAbortion in Multi-State Qualified Health Plans.  The Administration objects to language in the \nbill that would prohibit funding for abortion or administrative expenses in connection with a \nmulti-State qualified health plan.  The ACA already includes segregated funding requirements \nthat are structured to ensure no Federal funds are used for abortion except in cases of rape, incest, \nor life of the woman.  The language is unnecessary and goes beyond longstanding policy. \n \nImpediments to Derivatives Market Reforms.  The Administration opposes language in the bill \nthat would amend the Wall Street Reform Act to prohibit regulators from implementing key \nreforms to the derivatives markets designed to prevent excessive risk taking by financial \ninstitutions that are backed by Federal programs.  It undermines the efforts under the law to \nstrengthen the Nation's financial system by reducing risks for market participants.\n \nPublic-Private Competition.  The Administration opposes elimination of the mora torium on \npublic-private competition between Government employees and private sector contractors to \nperform commercial activities that support agency missions.  OMB continues to work with \nagencies on efforts to ensure the most effective mix of Federal employees and contractors and \nbelieves more time is needed for its guidance addressing management of the multisector \nworkforce to take effect before the moratorium is lifted.  The Administration urges the Congress \nto continue the moratorium in FY 2015, as proposed in the FY 2015 Budget. \n \nConstitutional Concerns   \n \nThere are multiple provisions of the bill that raise constitutional concerns. \n \nSection 203 of the bill would prohibit the use of funds for officers or employees of the EOP \"to \nprepare, sign, or approve statements abrogating legislation passed by the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate and signed by the President,\" and section 204 would prohibit the \nuse of funds for such officers and employees \"to prepare or implement an Executive Order that \ncontravenes existing law.\"  Contrary to the implication of section 203, presidential signing \nstatements do not abrogate legislation.  They indicate how the Executive Branch would apply \nacts of the Congress to ensure faithful execution of the laws.  Similarly contrary to the \nimplication of section 204, executive orders are designed to implement the law, not to contravene \nit.  To the extent sections 203 and 204 purport to prevent the President from making use of his \nimmediate aides in the EOP to prepare any statement articulating the conclusion that a particular \nprovision of law is unconstitutional and therefore would not be executed, in whole or in part, or \nfrom making use of these aides to prepare or implement an executive order instructing others in \nthe Executive Branch as to how to carry out this determination, these provisions would \n6  impermissibly encroach upon the President's constitutional authority to execute and interpret \nFederal laws, including the Constitution.   \n \nSection 621 of the bill would prohibit the use of funds for several positions that involve \nproviding advice directly to the President and any \"substantially similar positions.\"  The \nPresident has well-established authority to supervise and oversee the Executive Branch, and to \nobtain advice in furtherance of this supervisory authority.  The President also has the prerogative \nto obtain advice that would assist him in carrying out his constitutional responsibilities, and to do \nso not only from Executive Branch officials and employees outside the White House, but also \nfrom advisors within it.  Legislative efforts that significantly impede the President's ability to \nexercise his supervisory and coordinating authorities or to obtain the views of the appropriate \nsenior advisors violate the separation of powers. \n \nFinally, section 713 of the bill is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the \nExecutive Branch to disclose, without discretion, certain classified and other privileged \ninformation, in which case it would intrude on the President's discharge of his constitutional \nauthorities.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n7  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n \n                    July 22, 2014 \n                              (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4984 \u2013 Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act \n(Representative Guthrie, R-Kentucky, and 17 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration supports passage of H.R. 4984, Empowering Students Through Enhanced \nFinancial Counseling Act, which strengthens financial counseling requirements for students \nreceiving federal student aid.  This legislation would help students get the information they need \nto make responsible decisions about how to pay for higher education. \n \nWhile the bill offers a modest step in the right direction, it does not provide any new resources \nfor these purposes.  This legislation is not a substitute for much needed and more comprehensive \naction to tackle the rising cost of a college education.  The Administration urges the Congress to \ndo more to ensure that college is affordable for American families.  This is particularly important \ntoday, when a college education is critical to ensuring that our workforce has the skills needed to \nmeet the demands of the Nation's growing economy.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress to improve this legislation. \n \n* * * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                           \n  June 25, 2013 \n  (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\n \nH.R. 2410 \u2014 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, 2014 \n(Rep. Rogers, R-KY) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2410, making appropriations for  \nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs \nfor the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014.  The bill severely undermines key investments in \nfinancial oversight in a manner that would cripple Wall Street reform, and impedes implementation \nof statutorily-mandated financial regulations.  It also imposes harmful cuts in rural economic \ndevelopment, renewable energy development, nutrition programs, food safety, agricultural research, \nand international food aid.  Investing in these areas is critical to the Nation's economic growth, \nsecurity, and global competitiveness.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2410, his senior \nadvisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \nIn addition, enacting H.R. 2410, while adhering to the overall spending limits in the House Budget's \ntopline discretionary level for fiscal year (FY) 2014, would hurt our economy and require draconian \ncuts to middle-class priorities.  These cuts could result in hundreds of thousands of low-income \nchildren losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of children with disabilities losing \nFederal funding for their special education teachers and aides, thousands of Federal agents who \ncan't enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend fugitives, and thousands of scientists \nwithout medical grants, which would slow research that could lead to new treatments and cures for \ndiseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, and hurt America's economic competitiveness.  \n \nMore than two months have passed since the deadline for action and the Congress has yet to appoint \nconferees and agree on a budget resolution.  Prior to consideration of appropriations bills the \nCongress should complete an appropriate framework for all the appropriations bills that supports \nour recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national \nsecurity for our economy to compete in the future.  As such, the President's senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto H.R. 2410 and any other legislation that implements the House Republican \nBudget framework. \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee's version of the bill.   \n \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) \n \nInternational Food Aid Reform.  The Administration strongly objects to the funding level provided \nin the Committee bill for P.L. 480 Title II.  The bill fails to incorporate any of the efficiencies \nsought in the President's food aid reform request, and instead cuts P.L. 480 Title II funding by over \n20 percent compared to the Budget request, with the reduction coming entirely out of emergency \nfood aid.  By cutting emergency food aid funding and excluding the proposed changes to allow  more efficient food aid, the bill would delay food aid to starving people up to 14 weeks and would \npreclude as many as 12 million people from receiving life-saving assistance than under the \nAdministration's proposal. \n \nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).  The \nAdministration is deeply concerned that the WIC funding level in the Committee bill puts the \nprogram at significant risk of being unable to serve all eligible women and children who seek \nassistance, which could result in waiting lists, greater hardship, and poorer health outcomes for this \nvulnerable population.  In addition, the low funding level would effectively end the breastfeeding \npeer counseling program for the year, stall needed technology investments to improve program \nefficiency, and deplete the contingency reserve just to cover anticipated costs, leaving the program \nat risk of further cuts in the event of unexpected changes in food prices or participation.  \n \nChild Nutrition School Equipment Grants.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund school \nmeals equipment competitive grants, which would help school districts purchase the equipment \nneeded to serve healthier meals, improve food safety, expand access to meals, and improve energy \nefficiency.  \n \nFood Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  The Administration opposes the funding level for FSIS.  \nIn addition to a nearly $10 million reduction from the President's Budget request, the Committee \nbill forces FSIS to absorb $9 million in rental costs by not providing the necessary funding.  These \ncuts will significantly impact USDA's ability to adequately inspect food processing plants and \nprevent foodborne diseases from contaminating America's meat, poultry, and egg product supply.  \nOver 80 percent of FSIS's employees are frontline inspectors and the Committee's recommendation \nmay require the agency to furlough.  Decreased FSIS inspections will disrupt industry production.   \n \nResearch Facilities.  The Administration urges the House to include the requested $155 million to \nfully fund a high priority poultry biosafety and laboratory facility.  State-of-the-art research \nfacilities to replace USDA's aging laboratory infrastructure are key to the Department's ability to \nmeet research challenges of the 21st Century.   \n \nResearch Grants.  The Administration objects to the level of funding provided for the Agricultural \nFood and Research Initiative (AFRI) at $291 million, which is a reduction of approximately 24 \npercent from the FY 2014 Budget request.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the \nrequest for competitive peer-reviewed research grants through AFRI.   \n \nUSDA Funding for GSA Rent.  The Administration urges the Congress to include $164 million in \nfunding for rent as requested in the FY 2014 Budget.  The Committee bill would require 20 \nagencies\u2014including the three field agencies, the research agencies, the Office of Inspector General \nand others\u2014to absorb a total of $164 million in fixed rent costs.  This is a de facto reduction to \nalready constrained agency operating budgets.  For example, the bill would require the Economic \nResearch Service to divert more than 8 percent of its current budget to fund rental payments.  These \nproblems are exacerbated by not having the authority requested in the Budget to allow the \nDepartment to use mandatory funds to pay for administrative expenses related to delivering certain \nCommodity Credit Corporation programs. \n \nEvidence-Based Rural Business Grant Proposal.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress \nto include the FY 2014 Budget request to consolidate seven existing rural development grant \nprograms into a new program that would leverage evidence to award rural business grants.   \n2   \nClean and Renewable Energy.  The Administration urges the Congress to include the President's FY \n2014 Budget request to move the Rural Electric Loan Program away from fossil fuels and \nencourage the construction, acquisition, or improvement of renewable energy plants in rural \nAmerica.  In addition, the Administration urges the House to fund the Rural Energy for America \nProgram at the level requested in the Budget.   \n  \nRental Assistance Program.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided full \nfunding for expiring rental assistance contracts expected in FY 2014 of $1.012 billion, which will \ncontinue the support for USDA-financed properties on behalf of the tenants who receive subsidized \nrent.   \n \nBan on Horse Slaughter.  The Administration appreciates reinstatement of the Federal ban on horse \nslaughter and looks forward to working with the Congress to complete work on this important \nlegislation.  \n \nDepartment of Health and Human Services \n \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Administration strongly supports robust funding for \nFDA to continue implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act and to modernize \nregulatory science to support medical product innovation.  The Administration is concerned that the \nCommittee bill provides $4.3 billion in total resources for FDA, which is $342 million below the \nPresident's request, and does not include new proposed user fees.  The Administration urges the \nCongress to enact new user fees proposed in the FY 2014 Budget, which would provide significant \nadditional resources to enhance FDA regulatory capacity, as well as provide benefits to industry, \nadvance the Nation's food safety system, and continue implementation of the Food Safety \nModernization Act.  While the Administration appreciates the funding to continue the development \nof the FDA Life Sciences/Biodefense laboratory in White Oak, Maryland, the overall reductions in \nbudget authority will limit FDA's ability to oversee the safety and quality of Nation's food and \nmedical products and threaten the agency's ability to improve and maintain FDA's other critical \nfacilities.   \n \nOther Agencies \n \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The Administration strongly opposes the \nfunding level of $195 million for CFTC, which is $120 million below the President's FY 2014 \nBudget request.  The reduced funding level will seriously impede CFTC's implementation of critical \nWall Street reforms to increase market transparency and integrity, reduce risks to the economy and \nprotect consumers, and will unacceptably increase the risk of fraud and manipulation in the $30 \ntrillion futures and $250 trillion swaps markets.   \n \nGIPSA Marketing Rule \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes a provision in the Committee bill that effectively prevents \nUSDA's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration(GIPSA) from further \nimplementing the remaining portions of a rule on conduct violations of the Packers and Stockyards \nAct of 1921.  This provision would rescind many components of the rule that was finalized in \nDecember 2011 preventing its full implementation, which is needed to clarify conditions for \nindustry compliance with the Packers and Stockyards Act and provide for a fairer marketplace. \n3   \nCivilian Pay Raise \n \nThe Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for Federal \ncivilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is \nneither sustainable nor desirable.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n4  ", " \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n                               \n                                                                                                         July 31, 2013 \n                                                                                                         (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2009 \u2013 Prohibiting Treasury from Implementing the Affordable Care Act \n(Rep. Price, R-GA, and 141 cosponsors) \n \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2009 because it would cost millions \nof hard working middle class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they \ndeserve and will drive up premiums for an estimated 20 million people by more than $4,000 a \nyear on average.  Rather than attempting once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which the \nHouse has tried nearly 40 times, it is time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles \nand join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and \nsecurity for middle class families and all those working to get into the middle class. \n \nThe Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care and has already \nimproved many aspects of the Nation\u2019s health care system.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, \ntens of millions of Americans who have previously lacked health insurance will now be \ncovered.  The nearly one in two Americans under the age of 65 with pre-existing medical \nconditions will finally be able to purchase a health insurance plan that fits their budget, gives \nthem the care they need, and provides them with the peace of mind that comes from knowing \nthat they cannot be dropped from their health plan or denied coverage.  H.R. 2009 will prohibit \nimplementation of the tax credits that are key to this affordable coverage, undermining health \nsecurity for millions of Americans.  At a time when the Congress should be increasing small \nbusiness tax credits to help make health insurance more affordable, this legislation would take \nthem away.   \n \nH.R. 2009 would raise health insurance premiums and increase the number of uninsured \nAmericans and represents another attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, with no plan to \nreplace it or policy to improve it.   \n \nIf the President were presented with H.R. 2009, he would veto it. \n \n* * * * * * * \n  ", "  EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \n     OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n    WASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n   \n \nOctober 9, 2013  \n(House)   \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.J.

Boxer, D-CA, and Sen. Vitter, R-LA) \n \nThe Administration supports investing in the Nation's water resources to build the foundation for \nlong-term economic growth, address significant risks to public safety, and to protect and restore \nour environment.  The Administration's key policies and principles will help responsibly meet \nour Nation's water resources challenges in a fiscally responsible way.  The Administration \nbelieves we must move toward legislation that embodies these policies and principles, and S. 601 \ndoes not currently support all of those key policies and principles.   \n \nCurrently, the Corps has a $60 billion construction backlog and increasing operation and \nmaintenance costs of existing infrastructure.  New project authorizations should be limited to \nprojects most likely to provide high economic and environmental returns to the Nation, or \naddress a significant risk to public safety, within the Corps' three main missions: flood and storm \ndamage reduction; commercial navigation; and aquatic ecosystem restoration.  S. 601 would \nweaken Congressional involvement and transparency in the authorization of Corps studies and \nconstruction projects while expanding Federal obligations without ensuring taxpayer dollars are \ntargeted to achieve the highest overall return for the Nation.  Further, it limits spending controls \neven when actual project costs far exceed authorized levels.  \n \nCreating and maintaining our Nation's water resources infrastructure is a shared responsibility \nbetween Federal and non-Federal beneficiaries and requires that the management, use, \nprotection, and restoration of our water resources continue to evolve to meet the Nation\u2019s future \nneeds.  S. 601 undermines this principle.  For example, the bill would effectively require a \ntripling of the amount that the Federal government spends for harbor maintenance and related \nwork \u2013 a $15 billion increase in spending over the next 10 years without regard to the return to \nthe Nation from this investment.  Additionally, the bill would undermine a key reform enacted \nby the Congress in the landmark Water Resources Development Act of 1986 by eliminating cost-\nsharing for maintaining channels deeper than 45 feet, and by expanding the Federal role in other \nareas, which have always been non-Federal responsibilities.  While the Administration welcomes \nefforts to explore innovative water infrastructure financing tools, and has included a proposal for \ndoing so in its FY 2014 Budget, the Administration has concerns about the proposal in Title X of \nthe bill and would like to continue working with the Congress on specific ways to achieve the \ngoal.  \n \nThe Administration is deeply concerned that the project permitting provisions in S. 601 are \ncounterproductive, may actually slow project approval, and do not adequately protect \ncommunities, taxpayers, or the environment.  The bill constrains science-based decision making, \nincreases litigation risk, and undermines the integrity of several foundational environmental \nlaws, including the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA).  The Administration is making significant progress to  improve the efficiency of Federal permitting and reviews in a manner that encourages early \ncollaboration, stakeholder engagement and better environmental outcomes while not \njeopardizing bedrock environmental laws.  The Administration is aware that discussions on these \nprovisions are ongoing and urges the Senate to reaffirm the current foundational environmental \nreview framework for all water resources projects that fosters transparency, informed decision-\nmaking, and strong environmental outcomes, and to encourage the Corps to continue efforts to \nevaluate the full range of reasonable alternatives and to promote better environmental \nstewardship.  \n \nThe Administration supports rebuilding more resiliently after major disasters in light of future \nrisks of substantial storm and flood damage.  Federal policies and investments should encourage \nand incentivize improved management of water and related land resources at the local level to \nreduce vulnerabilities and enhance the resiliency and natural functions of floodplains and coastal \nareas and the communities in them, advance public safety, and promote efforts to preserve and \nrestore aquatic ecosystems.   \n \nThe Administration also urges a needed reform of the laws governing the Inland Waterways \nTrust Fund, which an FY 2014 Budget proposal would accomplish.  The proposal would \nestablish an annual per vessel fee to raise $1.1 billion in additional revenue over 10 years from \nthe commercial users of the inland waterways.  This user fee is needed to help finance their 50 \npercent share of inland waterways capital investments under current law.  It would support \neconomic growth, and reflect actual costs incurred by the Corps on their behalf. \n \nThe Administration remains committed to working with the Congress on bipartisan legislation to \naddress the Nation's water resource challenges.   \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n2  "], "45-Trump": ["EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND  BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nDecember 8, 2020 \n(House)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION   OLICY \nH.R. 6395 -  Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 6395, the [William M.

Smith, D-WA  and 1 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration  recognizes the importance of the National Defense  Authorization Act \n(NDAA) to our national  security. Unfortunately, this conference report  fails to  include critical \nnational security measures,  includes  provisions that fail  to respect our  veterans and our military\u2019s  \nhistory, and contradicts  efforts  by this Administration  to put America first in our national \nsecurity and foreign policy actions. Therefore, the Administration strongly opposes  passage of  \nthe conference report to Accompany H.R. 6395.  \nDespite bipartisan calls for addressing Section  230  of the Communications Decency  Act, this  bill \nfails to make any meaningful changes to that provision. Section 230 facilitates the spread of  \ndisinformation online and is a serious threat to our national security and  election integrity. It  \nshould be repealed.  The conference report also fails to  include  language codifying the Women\u2019s  \nGlobal Development and Prosperity (W-GDP)  Initiative. To date, this  historic initiative has \ngenerated  life-changing effects for women around the world, and the Administration strongly \nsupports its codification into the official mission  of the Department of State to  ensure its  critical \nwork continues in the future.  \nThe  conference report includes language sponsored by Senator  Elizabeth Warren  that would  \nrequire the  renaming of  certain military installations. Over  the course of  United States  history, \nthese locations have taken on significance to the  American story and those who have helped \nwrite it that  far transcends their namesakes. The Administration respects the legacy of the \nmillions of American  servicemen and women  who have served with honor at these military  \nbases, and who, from these locations, have fought, bled, and died for their country. President \nTrump has been clear in his opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to  rewrite \nhistory and to displace the enduring legacy of the American Revolution in service  of  a new left-\nwing cultural revolution.  \nThe conference report also restricts the President\u2019s ability to  preserve our Nation\u2019s security by  \narbitrarily limiting the amount of  military construction funds that can be  used to respond to a  \nnational emergency.  In  a time when adversaries have the means to directly attack the homeland, \nthe President must be able to safeguard the American people  without having to wait for  \ncongressional authorization. \nNumerous provisions of this conference report directly contradict the Administration\u2019s foreign \npolicy, particularly the President\u2019s  efforts to bring our troops  home. The  President  \u2013 and the   American people \u2013  oppose endless wars.  Over bipartisan objections,  however, this  bill purports  \nto restrict the President\u2019s ability  to  withdraw troops from Afghanistan, Germany, and South \nKorea. The conference report also undermines critical, bipartisan reforms to the United States  \nAgency for Global Media and hamstrings the  agency\u2019s newly confirmed CEO. Additionally, the  \nlegislation  eliminates the Department of Defense Chief  Management Officer,  who is  responsible \nfor increasing efficiency  and reducing waste at  the Department of Defense. And it  increases \nbureaucracy and confuses cybersecurity policymaking by mandating the appointment of a  \nNational Cyber Director  within the Executive Office of the President, ignoring the mechanisms  \nby which the Government already performs the functions assigned to this new policy position. \nThe Administration strongly opposes these  and other provisions that put  the interests  of the  \nWashington, D.C. establishment over those of the  American  people.  \n \nThe Administration stands ready to work with Congress on an improved NDAA, or to separately  \nenact  critically  important provisions  of this  bill,  such as a pay raise for our troops and the  \nrenewal of expiring  authorities,  through  the appropriations process.  The Administration also does \nnot waive potential objections  to additional, individual provisions of the NDAA not specifically  \naddressed in this statement.  \n \nIf the conference report  to H.R. 6395  were presented to  the President, his  advisors would \nrecommend he veto  it.   \n \n*******   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nJuly 16, 2019 \n   (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS.J.

This legislation would unfairly  force all Federal taxpayers to  \nsubsidize  a tax break for  the wealthy,  as well as  excessive government spending by fiscally \nirresponsible States.  H.R. 5377 would  likely cause State and local governments to raise taxes, all  \nwhile hindering the growth of small businesses and opportunities for workers.  \nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  of 2017 (TCJA), which passed Congress without a single Democrat  \nvote, is  a signature  achievement of the Trump Administration.  This bill, which President Donald \nJ.

Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act \n(Rep. Pallone, D-NJ, and 106 cosponsors) \nThe Administration opposes passage of H.R. 3, which contains several provisions that would \nharm seniors and all who need lifesaving medicines.  Nevertheless, as Congress follows the \nPresident\u2019s lead on reducing prescription drug costs, the Administration welcomes bipartisan \nefforts to enact legislation that provides additional prescription drug-cost relief for American \nfamilies.    \nIn its current form, H.R. 3 would likely undermine access to lifesaving medicines.  The bill \ncreates a statutory scheme for \u201cnegotiation\u201d between the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices and pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding the price of prescription drugs, but the \npenalty for failing to reach agreement with the Secretary is so large that the Secretary could \neffectively impose price controls on manufacturers.  Moreover, this price-fixing mechanism \nplaces price controls on drugs available under Medicare and commercial plans, and imposes \ndevastating fines on manufacturers, raising serious concerns under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nTakings Clause and Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause. \nThis bill would also compromise the health of Americans by dramatically reducing the incentive \nto bring innovative therapeutics to market.  The preliminary Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \nanalysis indicates that the bill would reduce the number of new medicines coming to market.  \nThe Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that H.R. 3\u2019s price controls would affect as \nmuch as one third of drugs under development, meaning that out of 300 projected new medicines \nthat would otherwise be approved over 10 years by the Food and Drug Administration, 100 could \nbe severely delayed or never developed.  As a result, CEA estimates H.R. 3 would erase a \nquarter of the expected gains in life expectancy in the United States over the next decade. \nThe preliminary CBO analysis of H.R. 3 does not account for the additional costs that would \nburden families and the Federal Government due to the unavailability of lifesaving and cost-\nreducing medicine that would otherwise exist.  For example, an Alzheimer\u2019s cure, or new \ntreatments for site specific cancers or diabetes, may be delayed or never developed under the \nregime imposed by H.R. 3.  Thus, the cost of caring for a growing and aging population with \ndirect care, skilled nursing, and home health could be substantially greater than the drug-cost \nsavings estimated by CBO.  More importantly, the effects of these cost increases on individuals \nand their families will be significant, personal, and long-lasting.  This legislation does include important policies championed by the Trump Administration to \nlower prescription drug costs.  These include establishing a cap on out-of-pocket expenses for all \nbeneficiaries in Medicare Part D and simplifying and improving that program. H.R. 3 also \nwould limit annual price increases of certain drugs in Medicare to the rate of inflation, protecting \nbeneficiaries and taxpayers from excessive price hikes. These provisions reflect the \nAdministration\u2019s priorities, although modifications should be made to strike a better balance in \nprotecting beneficiaries, taxpayers, and innovation. \nThe Administration strongly prefers the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, which \nwas reported out of the Senate Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis.  This legislation offers a \nsound approach to delivering relief to seniors from high prescription drug costs while \nsafeguarding the ongoing development of life-saving and sustaining medicines. \nAdditionally, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, shares many of the same bipartisan \nelements of the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act and is also a far better approach to \nlowering drug prices and discovering life-saving cures than H.R. 3. \nThe President believes there is a path forward to enacting bipartisan legislation that lowers \nprescription drug costs for American families. The Administration remains committed to \nworking with both parties to pass legislation that will lower drug costs while encouraging \ninnovation in the development of lifesaving medicines. \nIf H.R. 3 were presented to the President in its current form, he would veto the bill. \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nJanuary  27, 2020  \n(House  Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5543 (House Amendment to Senate  Amendment to H.R. 550) \u2013 No War Against  Iran  Act \n (Rep.

Over the last  several months, Iran, acting  through Qassem  \nSoleimani  and the  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force, planned and supported a \nseries of escalating attacks by  Iranian-directed Shia militia groups on Coalition  bases throughout  \nIraq.  These attacks included the December 27, 2019, assault on an Iraqi military base, which \nresulted in the death of  a  United States  citizen and badly wounded four United States  service \nmembers, as well as  the subsequent  storming  of  the United States Embassy  in Baghdad.  \nFollowing  the successful  United States action to eliminate Soleimani from the battlefield on  \nJanuary 2  and  Iran\u2019s retaliatory ballistic missile attack,  Iran  may be  refraining  from further \naggression.  This  legislation would undermine the  Administration\u2019s reestablishment of deterrence  \nwith Iran, which could perversely make violent conflict with Iran more likely.   \nAdditionally, H.R. 5543 would hinder the President\u2019s ability to protect United States diplomats, \nforces, and interests in the region from the  continued threat posed by  Iran and its proxies.  \nSpecifically, H.R. 5543\u2019s express bar  on the obligation or expenditure of any funds  for any use of  \nmilitary force against  Iran absent a prior  authorization by Congress could interfere with the \nPresident\u2019s ability to protect United States interests in the region, including  the ability to protect  \nUnited States  citizens and allies and partners, including  Israel.  \nH.R. 5543 also  presents  Constitutional concerns  because it seeks to  limit the  President\u2019s authority  \nas Commander  in  Chief  to direct forces to engage  in hostilities of limited nature, scope, and \nduration in order to protect important national interests, including the defense of the nation and its  \nforces  against imminent threats.

Politically  motivated regulatory actions  facilitated and encouraged by the previous  \nrules  forced precipitous  school closures that hurt  students  and taxpayers.  The Trump \nAdministration\u2019s rule, by contrast, fairly holds all institutions  to clear standards of  accountability  \nand allows the Department of Education to respond quickly and decisively  to early signs of  \nfinancial instability.    \nThe Trump Administration\u2019s borrower defense rule puts  students first and ensures  that student  \nborrowers  who have been defrauded by an institution of higher education have access to  \nindividualized debt relief.

The current situation at the Southern Border \npresents a humanitarian and security crisis that threatens core national security interests and  \nconstitutes a national emergency.   The Southern Border is a major entry point for criminals, gang  \nmembers, and illicit narcotics.  The problem of large-scale unlawful migration through the  \nSouthern Border is  enduring, and, despite the Administration\u2019s  use  of existing statutory  \nauthorities, in recent  years  the situation has worsened in certain respects.  In particular, we  have \nrecently  seen sharp increases in the number of  illegal entrances into the United States of family  \nunits, unaccompanied minors, and persons  claiming a  fear of return\u2014aliens whom the  \nAdministration is largely unable to detain or remove because of  antiquated laws and problematic  \ncourt decisions.  \nThe resolution would terminate the national emergency  declared by the President on February  \n15, 2019, and undermine  the Administration\u2019s ability to respond effectively  to the ongoing crisis  \nat the Southern Border.

On June 1, 2017, the President announced his intention to \nwithdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and to end implementation of the United \nStates\u2019 nationally determined contributions.  In the announcement he stated: \u201cThe  Paris Accord  \nwould undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose  \nunacceptable legal  risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the  \nworld.\u201d   Implementation of  the nationally determined contribution put forward by the United \nStates under the  Paris  Agreement would entail  billions of dollars in costs and put millions of  \nAmerican  jobs at risk, including those  in energy-intensive industries, while other countries did \nnot take on similarly stringent commitments.   Despite the enormous domestic costs, under  the \nAgreement  emissions are expected to  continue to grow internationally, including in countries  \nthat are major economic competitors  of the United States, placing our country  at a competitive  \ndisadvantage.   \nAmerican ingenuity and innovation have made  the United States  a world  leader  in supplying  \naffordable, abundant, and secure energy, both domestically  and to our allies, while also reducing  \nemissions and improving air quality  and public health.  The United States  has had the largest  \nabsolute decline in energy-related  carbon dioxide emissions among all countries since 2000, \naccording to the  International Energy Agency.  From 2005 to 2017, our energy-related carbon  \ndioxide emissions declined 14 percent, according  to the United States Energy  Information \nAdministration, even as  global emissions grew by 21 percent.

Clyburn, D-SC, and 15 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration opposes H.R. 8 because it would impose burdensome requirements on \ncertain firearm transactions.  H.R. 8 would require that  certain  transfers,  loans, gifts, and sales of  \nfirearms be processed by  a federally licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer of firearms. H.R. \n8 would therefore impose permanent record-keeping requirements and limitless fees on these \neveryday transactions.  H.R. 8 contains very narrow exemptions from these requirements, and \nthese exemptions  would not sufficiently protect the Second Amendment right of individuals to \nkeep and bear  arms.  For  example,  unless an exemption applies, both the act of leaving  a weapon \nin the temporary care of  a neighbor while traveling and the act of later  retrieving that weapon \nwould require processing by a  licensed entity under H.R. 8.  Also, unless such an exemption \napplies, domestic violence victims  would be prohibited from borrowing a  firearm for self-\ndefense without  first having the  transaction go  through such a licensed entity.  The extensive \nregulation required by H.R. 8 is incompatible with the Second Amendment\u2019s guarantee of an \nindividual right to keep arms.  \nBy overly  extending the  minimum time that a licensed entity is required to wait for background \ncheck results, H.R. 1112 would unduly impose burdensome delays on individuals  seeking to  \npurchase  a firearm.   For this reason, the Administration opposes the legislation.  H.R. 1112 \nwould require a federally licensed firearms  importer, manufacturer, or  dealer that initiates a  \nmandatory background check on an individual seeking to purchase a  firearm to wait ten business  \ndays  on results  before processing the transaction.  If the Federal  Government fails to complete  \nthe background check within  this window of  time, the individual seeking to purchase the firearm  \nmay petition the  Government for permission to proceed with the transfer. Under H.R. 1112, the \nlicensed entity  would be  required to wait an additional ten business days after such a  petition is  \nfiled before it is  allowed  to proceed with  processing the transaction.  Currently, such background \nchecks are considered  invalid 30 calendar days  after the date the licensed entity initiated them.   \nAs the bill  is written,  therefore, an individual must file their petition on the earliest day possible.  \nIf they fail to do so, H.R. 1112 would effectively  prohibit  some firearms purchases  from being  \nprocessed because the  initiated  background check would be considered invalid  before the end of  \nthe second ten-business-day  waiting period.  Allowing the  Federal  Government to restrict  \nfirearms purchases  through bureaucratic delay  would undermine the Second Amendment\u2019s   guarantee that  law-abiding citizens  have an  individual right to keep and bear arms.   \n \nIf H.R.  8, or H.R. 1112, are presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he  veto  \nthe bill.  \n \n \n* * * * * * *     ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nJanuary 9, 2019  \n(House)  \nS A P  \nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R.264 \u2014 Financial Services and General  Government  Appropriations Act, 2019 \n(Rep.

Slotkin, D-MI, and 134 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration strongly opposes passage of  H.Con.Res. 83, which purports to direct the  \nPresident to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces engaged in hostilities in or against \nIran or  any part of its government or military unless authorized by Congress.  \nAt the President\u2019s direction, on January 2, the United States military successfully executed a  \nstrike  in Iraq that killed  Qassem Soleimani, the Commander of the  Islamic Revolutionary Guard  \nCorps-Qods Force, a designated foreign terrorist organization.  Soleimani was  personally  \nresponsible for terrible atrocities.  He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching  \nterror strikes  against civilian targets.  He  fueled bloody civil wars all across the region.  He  \ndirected and facilitated actions that viciously wounded and murdered thousands of United States  \ntroops, including by planting bombs that maim and dismember their victims.   In  eliminating  \nSoleimani from the battlefield, the President took action to  stop a war, not to start a war.  He took \naction to protect our diplomats, our  service members,  our allies, and all Americans.    \nAlthough concurrent resolutions like H.Con.Res. 83 lack the force of law under controlling  \nSupreme Court precedent, I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), it is nevertheless important to \nhighlight some of its deficiencies.    \nFirst, H.Con.Res. 83 is unnecessary because the  military actions to which it applies are already  \nauthorized by law, including the Authorization for  Use of Military Force  Against  Iraq Resolution \nof 2002 (Public  Law 107-243) (\u201c2002 AUMF\u201d).  The 2002 AUMF provides  specific statutory  \nauthorization to engage in military action to \u201cdefend the national security of the United States  \nagainst the continuing threat posed by Iraq.\u201d  Public  Law 107-243, \u00a7 3(a)(1).  The United States  \nforces that have been threatened by  Iranian and  Iran-backed attacks in  Iraq are there to combat  \nterrorist groups\u2014such as  ISIS.  Thus, in addition to acting in accordance with his Constitutional  \nauthorities as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, the President also acted against  \nSoleimani pursuant to existing statutory  authorization.  The 2002 AUMF  has always been  \nunderstood to authorize the use of force  for, among other purposes, addressing terrorist threats\u2014 \nlike Soleimani and the attacks he was planning and facilitating\u2014emanating from Iraq.   This is \nconsistent with actions taken by previous Presidents pursuant to the 2002 AUMF.  For example,  \nduring the last administration,  United States forces  frequently conducted operations in response  \nto attacks and threats by  Iran-backed militias in  Iraq under the  authority  conferred by  the 2002 \nAUMF.  Moreover, the  Administration\u2019s engagement with Congress on this strike has been fully   in accordance  with past precedent, including by providing notification consistent with the War  \nPowers Resolution and by  briefing Congressional  leadership, the full membership of the House  \nand Senate, and appropriate staff.  \nSecond, were provisions like those included in H.Con.Res. 83 to become law, they could \nundermine the President\u2019s ability to defend United States forces  and interests in the region \nagainst ongoing threats from  Iran and its proxies.  Iran has  a long history of attacking United  \nStates and coalition forces  both directly  and through its proxies, including, most recently, by  \nmeans of a January 7 missile attack from  Iran against United States forces stationed at two bases  \nin Iraq.  Over the last several months, Soleimani  planned and supported these escalating  attacks  \nby Iranian-directed Shia militia groups  on coalition bases  throughout  Iraq.   He orchestrated the \nDecember 27, 2019 attack on an Iraqi military base, which resulted  in the death of a United  \nStates  citizen  and badly wounded four United States  service members.   Soleimani also  approved \nthe subsequent attack later that month on  the United States Embassy in Baghdad, which turned \nviolent and damaged  the  Embassy facility.   At the  time of  the January 2 strike, Soleimani  was  in \nIraq in violation of a United Nations Security Council travel ban and was  actively developing  \nplans to imminently  attack United States diplomats and service members in  Iraq and throughout  \nthe region.   Subsequently, Iran launched an  attack  against the United States.  Were Congress to  \nattempt to compel the President to adhere to a resolution like H.Con.Res. 83, it could hinder the  \nPresident\u2019s ability to protect United States forces and interests in the region from the continued \nthreat posed by  Iran and its proxies.  \nThis concurrent resolution is misguided, and its adoption by Congress could undermine the  \nability of the United States to protect American citizens whom  Iran continues to seek to harm.  \n \n* * * * * * *   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \n September  14, 2020  \n        (House  Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2574 \u2013  Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act  of 2019  \n(Rep.

This Administration believes that \nevery student should have equal access to a high-quality education, and  the  Department of \nEducation will continue to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  (Title VI)  faithfully \nand vigorously.  This bill, however,  fails  to advance equality in education, while  expanding  \nbureaucracy,  encouraging  burdensome litigation, and imposing costs on recipients of Federal \nfinancial assistance.   H.R. 2574  seeks  to  validate and  expand  the  divisive regulatory agenda  of \nthe previous administration\u2014advancing  an ideological mission  and  enriching favored special \ninterests like  trial lawyers  at the expense of students, educators, and taxpayers.   \nH.R. 2574  would supersede  Alexander v.

Granting a private cause of action for enforcement of \nsuch regulations would inevitably  lead to a massive expansion of litigation  involving  recipients \nof Federal  financial assistance, diverting resources toward litigation and away from education.   \nAdditionally, the bill would require each recipient of Federal financial assistance to appoint a \ncompliance  coordinator, which would impose additional compliance and administrative burdens \non  such entities  as well as on the Department of Education\u2019s  Office for Civil Rights  (OCR), \nwhich would be responsible for enforcing this requirement.  It would also subject such entities to \nliability based on cleverly aggregated and manipulated statistics, rather than facts that establish \nactual wrongdoing.  \nFinally, the proposed creation of the position of Special Assistant for Equity and Inclusion within  \nthe Department of Education  would confuse and potentially undermine OCR\u2019s  enforcement of \nTitle VI.  This new position would overlap with the longstanding role of the Assistant Secretary \nfor Civil Rights,  as well as the  responsibilities of  OCR,  to ensure equal access to education and \nto promote educational excellence through vigorous enforcement of civil rights in our Nation\u2019s \nschools.  \nH.R. 2574  would redirect vital resources  that are  needed to serve students in  the  pursuit of  an \nideological agenda.

Both bills represent misguided efforts to micromanage the Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS) and ignore ongoing efforts within DHS to achieve similar objectives.  \nIn addition, both bills raise resource concerns and, arguably, could force a diversion of resources \naway from other DHS responsibilities. \nH.R. 3525 purports to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to research additional \napproaches to providing medical screening to individuals in U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection (CBP) custody.  The bill also purports to require DHS to develop an electronic health \nrecord system for use by all DHS components operating along the borders of the United States \nfor individuals in custody.  Additionally, the requirement to establish a departmental electronic \nhealth record system likely could not be implemented within the allotted 90 days. \nThe Administration takes seriously the United States Government\u2019s obligation to care for those \nin its custody and to treat individuals with dignity and respect.  CBP is working to expand its \nmedical care contracts across the Southwest Border to increase medical assessments upon \nentering into CBP custody.  CBP Directive 2210-003, CBP Interim Enhanced Medical Efforts \n(January 2019), requires a health interview for anyone in CBP custody under the age of 18, and \nin some cases, for adults.  The directive outlines when a medical assessment is required, and \nestablishes procedures for referrals of those who may require higher levels of medical care. \nCBP is reviewing its practices related to the care of migrants in its custody and is working to \ndevelop a final medical directive.  The Administration looks forward to working with the \nCongress to improve medical care for those in CBP custody. \nThe Manager\u2019s Amendment to H.R. 2203 purports to establish an Office of the Ombudsman for \nBorder and Immigration Enforcement Related Concerns, which would be an independent entity \nwithin DHS responsible for assisting individuals in resolving complaints against CBP, U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and their associated entities.  The duties assigned \nto this Ombudsman and the context in which this officer would perform such duties would not \nbe akin to other DHS officials who serve in an ombudsman or oversight capacity.  Moreover, \nthe Manager\u2019s Amendment would vest this Ombudsman with authorities and responsibilities \nthat are currently reserved to, and would needlessly duplicate the functions of, other DHS  officers, such as the DHS Inspector General.  Moreover, the Manager\u2019s Amendment would \nrequire the Ombudsman to appoint a Border Community Liaison in each Border Patrol Sector \nfor the purpose of fostering cooperation between CBP, ICE, and border communities, as well as \nconsulting on policy and program development.  CBP and ICE should and do represent \nthemselves before border communities without relying on an independent entity to broker \ndialogue with their stakeholders. Creating a duplicative office for these purposes could actually \nreduce DHS\u2019s oversight and liaison effectiveness by splintering efforts and obfuscating \nresponsibility. \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nNovember  19, 2019 \n(House Rules) \nS A P  \nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R.  1309 \u2014 Workplace Violence Prevention  for Health Care and Social Workers Act  \n(Rep.

This legislation  mandates adopting  California\u2019s healthcare \nworkplace violence standards nationwide, which would undercut important principles of \nfederalism and could put workers\u2019 health and jobs in jeopardy.

The President  has signed legislation that includes almost $2.5 trillion in spending to \nimprove public health, provide housing support, assist  small  businesses, and  help individuals and \nfamilies  bridge the gap as they deal  with the challenges presented by the coronavirus.   \nThe Administration has  also acted swiftly to  provide  relief for homeowners and renters.  It has \nimplemented foreclosure and eviction moratoriums, mortgage forbearance, and other  CARES  \nAct protections.  Additionally, Federal agencies  have provided streamlined options under  \nexisting authorities  to help eligible  borrowers on forbearance become current on their mortgages  \nwithout having to make large lump sum repayments.     \nThe  Administration remains  committed to working with Congress in a bipartisan manner  to  \nassist  families who have been affected by the coronavirus.  This proposed legislation, however, \nis more concerned with delivering on longstanding partisan and ideological wish lists  than with \nenhancing the ability of  our Nation to deal with the public health and economic challenges we  \nface.  When additional legislation is  considered, it should focus on restarting the American \neconomy, putting Americans back to work, renewing American manufacturing dominance, and \nrebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure.  By focusing on these priorities and building on positive  \nsteps the Administration  has already taken, Congress can more effectively protect homeowners  and renters and support  our economic comeback.  \n \nIf H.R. 7301 were presented to the President, his  advisors would recommend that he  veto the bill.  \n \n* * * * * * *   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n       February  11, 2019  \n(House Rules)   \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.J. Res. 37 \u2013  Directing the President to Remove United States Armed  Forces from  \nHostilities in the Republic of Yemen that Have Not Been Authorized by Congress  \n(Rep. Khanna, D-CA and  96  cosponsors)  \nThe Administration strongly opposes passage of  H.J. Res 37, a joint resolution that purports to \ndirect the President to remove  United States forces  from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of  \nYemen, with certain  exceptions.   \nThe premise of the joint resolution is flawed. Since 2015, the United States has provided limited \nsupport to member countries of the Saudi-led  coalition, including intelligence sharing, logistics  \nsupport, and, until recently, aerial refueling, to assist in the defense of United States  allies and \npartners. The provision of this support has not caused United States  forces  to be introduced into \nhostilities.  Such support is provided pursuant to licenses and approvals under the Arms Export  \nControl Act, statutory authorities  for Department  of Defense to provide logistics support to \nforeign countries, and the President\u2019s constitutional powers. Because  the President has directed  \nUnited States forces to support the Saudi-led coalition under his constitutional powers, the joint  \nresolution would raise serious constitutional concerns to the extent it seeks to override the  \nPresident\u2019s determination as Commander in Chief. \nIn addition to its erroneous premise, the  joint resolution would harm bilateral relationships in the  \nregion, negatively  affect  our ability to prevent the  spread of violent extremist organizations\u2014 \nsuch as al-Qa\u2019ida in the  Arabian Peninsula and ISIS in Yemen\u2014and establish bad  precedent  for \nfuture legislation by  defining \u201chostilities\u201d to include defense cooperation such as aerial refueling  \nfor purposes of this legislation. While we appreciate that sections 4 and 5 of  the resolution \nacknowledge  these serious consequences to some extent, after-the-fact reporting is not an \neffective means to mitigate  them. Our continued cooperation with regional  partner nations  allows  \nthe United States to support diplomatic negotiations to end the  conflict, promote humanitarian \naccess,  mitigate civilian  casualties,  enhance efforts to recover  United States hostages in Yemen, \nand defeat terrorists  who  seek to harm the United  States.  \nIf H.J.

Roybal-Allard, D-CA, and 232 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration  strongly opposes H.R. 6, the  American Dream and Promise Act  of 2019.  \nH.R. 6 would incentivize and reward illegal  immigration while ignoring  and  undermining  key \nAdministration  immigration objectives and policy priorities, such as protecting our communities  \nand defending our borders.  \nThe Administration has put forward proposals to address the status of the hundreds of thousands  \nof Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and \nDeferred  Enforced  Departure  (DED) recipients, but only in the context of  actual  solutions that  \nwould address the underlying problems in our immigration system.  \nIn contrast, H.R. 6 would  only exacerbate illegal immigration and the  exploitation of our  \nimmigration laws by incentivizing more illegal behavior while doing nothing to address the  \nproblems at our southern border or broader immigration enforcement  efforts.  H.R. 6 would also  \ncontinue the cycle of our  broken immigration system that encourages people to break the law  at  \nthe expense of those who follow the rules.  For example, it would explicitly  ignore those who \nproactively committed immigration fraud, which would be  a slap in the face to those who chose  \nto enter our country legally and who are currently  waiting  to become American citizens.   \nFurthermore, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation will increase budget \ndeficits by  more than $30 billion, a cost  primarily  driven by  increased spending on Obamacare \nsubsidies, Medicaid, the  Children\u2019s Health  Insurance Program, Supplemental Nutrition  \nAssistance Program, and Federal student aid for this population of newly legalized immigrants. \nRather than sending a signal that will invite more people to illegally  enter our  country, the \nAdministration urges the  Congress to focus on real solutions to address the problems within our  \nimmigration system.  In the short term, that means providing the  supplemental resources the \nAdministration  has requested to address  the humanitarian crisis at the  southern border, including  \nfunding for the care of thousands of unaccompanied alien children.  It means working to pass \nlegislation to  close the loopholes that are driving the current exploitation of our asylum system  \nand that lead to catch and release.  It means providing funding for the construction of the wall in \npriority locations identified by the Border Patrol to impede and deny the  flows of illegal \nimmigrants, drugs, and other illicit activities.  It means  moving toward a merit-based  \nimmigration system  that prioritizes  high-skilled immigration.  \nNo compromise is possible without both sides coming to the table, and no compromise is  \nworthwhile that does not  address real underlying problems and improve our immigration system. \nPresident  Donald J. Trump remains committed to working in a bipartisan manner to fix our   immigration system, but the Administration will not accept stand-alone policies that undermine  \nits  core immigration policy  goals.  \n \nIf H.R. 6 were presented  to the President  in its current form,  his advisors would recommend that  \nhe veto the bill.   \n  \n* * * * * * *  \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nSeptember 17, 2019 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1423 \u2013 Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act \n(Rep.

Res. 80 - Providing for congressional  \ndisapproval of the proposed export to the United Arab Emirates of certain defense articles  \nand services  \n(Sen. Menendez, D-NJ, and 2 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration strongly opposes passage of Senate Joint Resolutions (S.J. Res.) 77, 78, 79, \nand 80, disapproving the  Foreign Military Sale of  certain  defense articles, defense services, and  \ntechnical data to the  United Arab Emirates  (UAE).  \nOn September 15, 2020, the United States, Israel, the UAE, and  Bahrain signed the historic \nAbraham Accords  Declaration, normalizing  the UAE-Israel and  Bahrain-Israel bilateral  \nrelationships, the first such breakthrough for Middle East peace since Israel and Jordan  \nnormalized relations in 1994. \nThese  sales  to the UAE that would be affected by  the joint resolutions directly support the  \nforeign policy and national security objectives of the United States, including those reflected in \nthe Abraham  Accords.  They do so by enabling  the UAE  to deter increasing  Iranian  aggressive \nbehavior and threats issued in the wake of that peace deal.  Since the UAE\u2019s announcement of its  \nintent to normalize relations with  Israel under the  Abraham Accords, official Iranian statements  \nhave asserted that \u201cthe  UAE\u2019s betrayal won\u2019t last  long,\u201d  and that its actions  have made it  \u201ca \nlegitimate and  easy target.\u201d   In  addition to making the UAE more  capable of exercising its  \ninherent right of national  self-defense, if necessary, these sales also improve the UAE\u2019s  \ninteroperability with the United States and our allies and close partners, further enabling joint  \nconfrontation of regional challenges for  years to come. \nThese sales  are consistent with the longstanding  commitment and statutory  obligation of the  \nUnited States  to maintain  Israel\u2019s  Qualitative Military Edge (QME).  The Department of State, in  \nconsultation with the Department of Defense, has included in its certification to Congress  a \ndetermination  that these sales will not adversely affect  Israel\u2019s QME.  In  a joint statement on \nOctober 23, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  and Defense Minister Benny  Gantz  \nendorsed the delivery of  advanced defense capabilities to the UAE, noting the commitments  by \nthe United States  to maintain  Israel\u2019s QME.  Transfer of  enhanced capabilities to a partner after  \nnormalization of relations with  Israel is consistent with decades-long United States  precedent.   \nThe United States provided enhanced security capability to Egypt  following its 1979 \nnormalization of relations with  Israel,  and provided enhanced security  capability to Jordan \nfollowing its 1994 normalization of relations with  Israel.   Additionally, these sales solidify  our Nation\u2019s  position as the security partner of choice for the \nUAE and others in the  region.  Through the  Abraham Accords  and through its request for these \nsales, the UAE has sent a strong signal to other  global powers  regarding the strength of its  \npartnership with the United States.  Further, the United States provision of enhanced capabilities  \nto a partner that has normalized relations with Israel encourages other partners to follow the  \nsame path.  Since the August 2020 announcement of the Abraham Accords  by Israel,  the UAE,  \nand the United States, Bahrain and Sudan have also announced normalization of relations with  \nIsrael.    \nAdditionally, consistent with the President\u2019s Conventional Arms Transfer  Policy, all arms  \ntransfers to foreign partners are subject to a case-by-case comprehensive assessment of United \nStates  interests.  This assessment includes an analysis of the risk of misuse, technology security, \nand civilian casualties.   Congress has been notified of these assessments,  and these assessments  \nexpress  confidence that the  UAE is capable of protecting the technologies involved and of using  \nthem in a responsible manner.  \nThe United States has undertaken many  actions to help  its partners, including the UAE, \nstrengthen their compliance with international law, including the law of armed conflict.  The  \nUnited States has also taken actions to help the UAE  mitigate the  risk of civilian  harm, including  \ntraining and advising to improve its targeting processes.  Legislation like these resolutions could, \nwithout further examination, have unintended consequences for defense procurement and \ninteroperability between  the United States and our partners, and could create diplomatic and \nsecurity opportunities for our adversaries to exploit.   \nIf the President were presented with  any of these joint resolutions, his advisors would \nrecommend he veto them.  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \n       July 24, 2019 \n       (House)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \n H.R. 3239 - Humanitarian Standards  for Individuals in \nCustoms and Border Protection Custody Act  \n(Rep. Ruiz, D-CA, and 160 cosponsors) \nThe Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3239 as currently written due to its \nsignificant legislative  shortcomings.  The bill purports to establish humanitarian standards for \nindividuals in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody by establishing  minimum  \nstandards of healthcare, hygiene, food, and shelter.  As  written,  however, the  bill would go far \nbeyond establishing humanitarian standards for short-term detention, and would require the  \nDepartment  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  to provide comprehensive healthcare services in  \nshort-term detention  facilities.  The  Administration  is committed  to  the  humane  treatment  of \nmigrants within its custody, including at CBP short-term facilities.   If fully implemented,  \nhowever, the  bill would require a  complete overhaul of  CBP facilities, increase staffing  \nrequirements beyond currently funded levels, and significantly increase the  amount of  time  \nmigrants spend in short-term  CBP custody.  These results are not  in the best interests of  either  \nmigrants or  the  United States.  \nThe Federal Government  currently takes extensive measures to ensure the humane treatment  of  \nmigrants  within  its custody.  Short-term detention  by CBP  is governed by the National \nStandards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (TEDS), which sets forth \ncomprehensive, publicly available standards  for  CBP  facilities.  In accordance with  TEDS, CBP \ntreats at-risk populations, including children, UACs, pregnant individuals, and those with \nmental, physical, or developmental disabilities, with dignity, respect, and special concern for \ntheir particular vulnerabilities.  CBP also fulfills the requirements set forth by  TEDS to  examine  \nmigrants  for any sign of injury, illness, or health concern.  CBP  also  conducts medical  \nscreenings of  aliens  entering its  facilities.  \nThe health screenings that H.R. 3239 would require over and above what CBP already provides \nwould divert critical time and resources away from individuals who need care and impose \ntremendous burdens on CBP personnel and resources.  They would  require significant time to  \ncomplete and  require extensive testing, regardless of  claims or  the appearance of injury or \nillness.  As  a result, the  bill would  significantly increase  aliens\u2019 time in CBP custody,  which is  \nnot in the best interest of the aliens,  as CBP facilities are not designed for  long-term detention.  \nThe bill would also require CBP to hire or contract for additional medical professionals, mental \nhealth and other specialists, and chaperones.  CBP is  a law  enforcement, national security  \norganization and is not funded, equipped, or staffed to provide the level of medical care required  \nby this bill.  In order to alleviate pressures on CBP capacity, funding should be provided for \nadditional long-term detention  capacity with  Immigration  and  Customs Enforcement (ICE)  and   with respect to  the care  and custody of unaccompanied alien children, the  Department of  Health  \nand Human Services (HHS).  Added  capacity at  these agencies would far  better serve the bill\u2019s  \napparent purpose of improving the medical care provided to migrants while  further advancing  \ntheir interests by facilitating  their expeditious removal from short-term detention.   \nAdditionally, the bill would require a  wholesale  reconfiguration of CBP\u2019s  short-term detention  \nfacilities by  requiring that space  be available  for  medical staff  and other facilities adjustments.  \nNotably, the bill would require CBP to maintain facility occupancy  ceilings even during surge  \nperiods, which would undermine full enforcement of our immigration laws.  The bill would also \nrequire CBP to make changes to its facilities that would be inconsistent with, and potentially  \neven impede, its law enforcement mission.   Taken together, various provisions of the bill would \nrequire  extensive and costly facility renovations or expansions to many CBP facilities along the  \nUnited States southern border \u2013 without providing  any  funding to bring the facilities into  \ncompliance.  \nThe Congress  earlier this month  passed a $4.6 billion humanitarian border  supplemental that  \nprovided much needed emergency  resources and support to DHS, HHS, and the Departments of  \nJustice and Defense.  Many of these resources are  being deployed to ensure alien children and \nfamilies receive the care and attention they deserve and are treated fairly  and humanely  while in  \nFederal custody.  Further, both DHS and HHS have instituted and maintain rigorous  accounting  \nof those in Federal custody, which is reflected in publicly available and periodically updated \nreports.   \nThe Administration supports legislation that would assist CBP, ICE, and HHS in meeting the  \nhumanitarian needs of those in their custody.  However, as written, H.R. 3239 would place  \nonerous requirements on CBP, while possibly hindering its law  enforcement mission and \ndiverting scarce resources away from migrants in need of care.  The Administration looks  \nforward to working with the Congress on reforms that improve conditions for migrants in CBP  \ncustody without exacerbating the challenges CBP faces in managing the surge of migrants  \nacross the United States southern border.  \nIf H.R. 3239 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he veto it. \n* * * * * * * \n2   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \n   July 9, 2019 \n  (House  Rules)  \nS A P  \nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2500 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020  \n(Rep. Smith, D-WA)  \nThe National Defense  Authorization Act (NDAA)  plays  an essential  role in securing our national  \nsecurity interests, and the Administration supports  enactment of  an NDAA for the 59th consecutive  \nyear.  While the Administration appreciates the  House Armed Services  Committee\u2019s  (Committee)  \ninvestments in key national security priorities and its  support for the men and women of the Armed \nForces and their  families,  H.R. 2500 includes a number of provisions that raise deep concerns.  \nThe level of  funding that  would be authorized by the bill\u2014a  total of $733 billion for national \ndefense\u2014is $17 billion below the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 Budget  request  and  would not  fully \nsupport  critical national security  priorities.  The Administration is also concerned about the  bill\u2019s  \nallocation  of funds  between base national defense  and Overseas Contingency  Operations (OCO)  \naccounts\u2014an  allocation that  exceeds the discretionary cap in place under current law.  As outlined \nin the Budget request, the Administration prefers  to limit base national defense funding to the  \ncurrent law\u2019s discretionary  cap, while using both OCO and emergency  funding to provide the  \nadditional  necessary resources to support the National Defense Strategy (NDS).  This approach is  \nvital to ensuring that the  Nation has the funding  necessary  to defend itself without another budget  \nagreement or legislation increasing the discretionary cap.   \nThe Administration  also has significant concerns  about  several provisions of H.R. 2500.  These \nprovisions would pose serious challenges to continued execution of the NDS and the 2018 Nuclear  \nPosture Review (NPR); impair  the President\u2019s  authorities, prerogatives, and responsibilities as  \nCommander  in  Chief;  impede efforts to ensure  border security;  undermine the Nation\u2019s defense  \nposture; and harm the warfighter.   \nIf H.R. 2500 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he veto it. \nModification and Clarification of Construction  Authority in the Event of a Declaration of  \nWar or National Emergency (Section 2802).  The Administration strongly  objects to  section  \n2802 because it would significantly  curtail the authority of the  Department of Defense (DOD)  \nunder 10 U.S.C. 2808 by  imposing spending  caps, limiting the source of  funds, constraining the  \nSecretary of Defense\u2019s ability to waive laws that impede expeditious response to an emergency, \nand imposing burdensome congressional reporting requirements.  Section 2808 was originally  \nenacted to allow for the  adjustment of  military  construction priorities in the event of a declaration  \nof war or national emergency  and this section would greatly  restrict that ability.       \nModification and Technical Correction of Authority for Deployment of  Members of the \nArmed Forces to  the Southern Land Border of  the United States (Section 1044).   The \nAdministration  strongly  objects to this provision\u2019s 30-day advanced certification and notification \nrequirements.  The requirement would limit the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s ability to use this authority  \nto respond in a timely manner to emerging U.S. Customs and Border Protection requests for  \nassistance.   Furthermore, a requirement to give Congress advance notice of  military deployments  \nwould contravene the President\u2019s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.   \n \nProhibition on Use of Department of Defense  Funds  for Construction of a Wall, Fence, or  \nOther Physical Barrier Along the Southern Border of the United States (Sections 1046 and  \n2801).   The Administration strongly  objects to  these provisions  because they  would prohibit the  \nuse of  all DOD funds to design or  carry out a project to construct, replace, or modify  a wall, fence, \nor other physical barrier  along the international border between the  United States and Mexico, \nincreasing risk to our homeland security.  Additionally, these provisions would leave the Secretary  \nof Defense unable to effectively support use of the Armed Forces in connection with the ongoing  \nnational emergency.  \n \nModification of Authority to  Provide Support to Other Agencies for Counterdrug Activities  \nand Activities to Counter Transnational Organized Crime  (Section 1011).  The Administration  \nstrongly  objects to this provision, which would remove DOD\u2019s authority to support  United States  \nlaw enforcement  agencies by constructing  fences to block drug smuggling corridors across  \ninternational borders of the United States.  The provision would also require detailed congressional  \nnotification prior to providing any support to other  United States  departments and agencies.   \nSpecifically, it would significantly impede DOD\u2019s ability to provide ongoing, real-time, and \nmission-critical linguist and intelligence analysis services; transportation of personnel, supplies,  \nand equipment involved in active Federal investigations; the detection and monitoring of United \nStates  inbound suspect aerial and surface traffic;  as well as aerial and  ground reconnaissance \nsupport to law enforcement partners.     \n \nLimitation on General  and Special Transfer Authority (Sections 1001 and 1512).  The \nAdministration strongly  objects to the bill\u2019s significant recommended reductions to the  DOD\u2019s \ngeneral  and special transfer authorities.  Specifically, section 1001 of the bill would limit DOD\u2019s \nbase budget  general transfer authority to $1 billion in FY 2020, $4 billion below the Budget  \nrequest.  The Administration  also objects to section 1001(c) because removing DOD\u2019s authority to \nreprogram resources in support of the Drug  Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities  would unduly  \nrestrict the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s ability to support United States  interagency  efforts to combat \ntransnational criminal organizations and the influx of opioids and other dangerous narcotics that  \nkill tens of thousands of Americans  each year.  Section 1512 of the bill would limit OCO special \ntransfer  authority to $0.5 billion in FY 2020, $4 billion below the FY 2020 Budget request.  \nLimiting DOD\u2019s transfer  authorities would severely  constrain DOD\u2019s ability  to shift funds between  \naccounts to meet unforeseen or  emerging military  requirements.   \n \nProhibition on Availability of Funds  for Deployment of Low-yield  Ballistic Missile Warhead  \n(Section 1646).  The Administration strongly objects to provisions that would reduce  funding for  \nthe Trident  II Modification Program and the W76-2 Modification Program, and block deployment  \nof the system.  As a measured response to a real-world escalatory threat, the W76-2 warhead  \n2  reinforces the credibility of our deterrence posture and represents a key element of the 2018 NPR.  \nBlocking deployment would  send a dangerous message to potential adversaries, many of whom are \ninvesting  in  their own  modernization priorities, that the  United States is incapable of  adjusting its  \nnuclear posture despite a worsening nuclear environment.  This  would undermine deterrence and \nincreases nuclear risk to the United States and our  allies.   \nIntermediate-Range Nuclear  Forces (INF) Treaty  Response Options (Prompt Global Strike  \nProgram Element)  (Section 1684).  The Administration strongly objects to section 1684, which \nwould eliminate $76 million in research and development funding for INF Treaty response options. \nThe reduction would disadvantage the United States in the event that Russia does not return to \ncompliance with its obligations under the INF  Treaty by the August 2, 2019 deadline.  The  \nAdministration continues to have the full support of NATO and other key allies in its response to \nRussia\u2019s violation; the elimination of the funds in the budget request would lead those allies to  \nquestion our resolve in ensuring Russia cannot achieve a military advantage through its violation of \nthe Treaty.   \nSubmission to Congress of Department of Defense Execute Orders  (Section 1082).  The  \nAdministration strongly objects to section 1082, which would mandate the submission to Congress \nof information that, if disclosed, could impair national security, foreign relations, law enforcement, \nor the safety of  military operations and personnel.  It thus would contravene the President\u2019s \nconstitutional authority  as Commander in Chief  as well as his constitutional prerogative not to  \ndisclose privileged information. \nUnited States  Space Corps  Sections  (921 - 925).  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s  support for the establishment of a sixth branch of the Armed Forces focused on space \nwithin the Department of the Air Force.  Elevating the space domain to be on par with the air, land, \nand sea domains is critical to the  Nation\u2019s future defense.   In order to achieve the Committee\u2019s \nintent, the  Administration requests the inclusion of additional technical and conforming \namendments, such as pay and allowances for members of the new Armed Force, retirement of \nofficers  and enlisted  members, and original appointments of commissioned officers.  Finally, the \nAdministration urges  the Committee to consider authorizing the Secretary of Defense to begin \ntransferring appropriate Air Force and non-Air Force personnel to the new Armed Force in FY \n2020, and authorize a senior civilian dedicated to the new Armed  Force and the space domain as  a \nwhole.  \nModification of Plutonium  Pit  Production Capacity;  Plutonium Sustainment  (Sections 3114  \nand 4701).  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's proposed reduction of $241.1 \nmillion in requested funding for the National Nuclear Security  Administration's (NNSA) \nplutonium sustainment efforts.  The requested level  is  necessary to meet the military requirement to \nproduce no fewer than 80 pits per year by 2030.  This 32 percent  reduction would significantly \ndelay NNSA's efforts to improve safety and security features while modernizing the stockpile.  \nAdditionally, delaying the pit production program would force NNSA to further increase its future \npit production capacity to address plutonium aging, thereby requiring a larger and more costly pit \nmanufacturing capability.  \nGround-Based  Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) (Section 4201).  The Administration strongly \nobjects to the Committee\u2019s proposed reduction of $103 million to the GBSD program.  GBSD is \n3   \nrequired to modernize the nation\u2019s land-based nuclear forces, which are currently dependent upon \nthe Minuteman III system first deployed in the 1970s.  The Air Force is on track to award a  \ncontract for the next phase of the GBSD program in FY 2020.  This funding reduction would \nprevent the Air  Force from awarding this contract and delay recapitalization of this  leg of the \nnuclear triad.  \n \nNNSA Nuclear Warhead Modernization.   The Administration strongly  objects to the \nCommittee\u2019s proposed funding reductions to several  of NNSA\u2019s nuclear warhead modernization \nprograms.  Reductions to B83 Stockpile Systems  may preclude  NNSA from carrying out NPR  \ndirection to sustain the B83-1 until a suitable replacement is identified.  Such a reduction would \nundermine NNSA\u2019s  ability to meet warfighter  requirements and force tradeoffs that would impact \nthe reliability of  fielded deterrent systems.   \n \nReductions to the W87-1 Modification Program would delay the program, increase its cost, and \njeopardize DOD\u2019s plans to deploy the next generation intercontinental ballistic missile, thereby  \nincreasing risk and costs to maintain and qualify the existing warhead.  The W87-1 will provide  \nenhanced safety  and security compared to the legacy W78 that it will replace.   Reductions to W80 \nStockpile Systems targeted for  a study to help inform Administration views on a nuclear-armed  \nsea-launched cruise missile (SLCM) would make it impossible to properly assess the viability of  \nthe SLCM and to inform  Congress of the assessment.  Finally, while the Administration  \nappreciates the increase to NNSA\u2019s cap on  Federal hiring, the reduction to NNSA Federal Salaries  \nand Expenses would severely impact NNSA\u2019s ability to recruit, hire, and retain the highly skilled \nworkforce needed to provide necessary program and project  guidance and oversight to execute  \nnuclear security  programs.  \n \nMissile Defense Programs  (Section 4201).  The  Administration strongly  objects to the $413 \nmillion in  reductions  to the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s (MDA) funding request as well as the re-\nscoping of  Flight Test Mission-44 (FTM-44) during a period of  escalating threats to the homeland  \nand our allies.  Specifically, the Administration objects to the $150 million reduction to the  \nImproved Homeland Defense  Interceptor Program (Redesigned Kill Vehicle).  The reduction \nwould be premature pending the result of DOD\u2019s  analysis of  alternative  courses of action for the  \nRedesigned Kill Vehicle effort and could cause even further delays to the delivery of 20 additional  \nGround-Based Interceptors. \n \nThe Administration  also strongly objects to the $42 million reduction to re-scope FTM-44, a  \nStandard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block  IIA flight test, from testing against a threat representative  \nIntercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) to testing against a threat representative  Intermediate- \nRange  Ballistic Missile (IRBM).  Section 1680 of  the National Defense Authorization Act for  \nFiscal Year 2018 (Public Law 115-91) directed MDA to conduct an SM-3  Block  IIA flight test \nagainst a threat representative ICBM.  The re-scoping to conduct the test against a threat  \nrepresentative IRBM  rather than an ICBM would prevent MDA  compliance with section 1680.  In \naddition, the re-scoping of the test to a non-ICBM target would add little technical value, as MDA  \nhas already successfully tested the SM-3 Block  IIA missile against a threat representative  IRBM in  \nFlight Test Integrate-03 (FTI-03) in December 2018, and also against a threat representative \nMedium Range  Ballistic  Missile in FTM-45 in October 2018.  \n \n4   \nNext  Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) (Section 4201).   The Administration strongly objects  \nto the $500 million reduction in the NGAD program.  Full funding for NGAD is  essential to \nmaintaining  a strong United States  industrial base capable of building the world\u2019s most advanced \naircraft.  This 50 percent  reduction in funding  would  result in a three-year slip in advanced  aircraft  \ndevelopment timelines and the cancellation of critical  new production technology programs. \nReduced funding would also  risk setting the United States behind other nations applying rapidly  \nevolving digital technology to future  aircraft  programs. \n \nLimitation on Availability of Funds for VC\u201325B Aircraft (Section 125).   The Administration  \nstrongly objects to this provision, which would create significant cost and schedule risk to the VC-\n25B program.  As such, the program would likely  be exposed to a Request for Equitable  \nAdjustment stemming from the inability to respond in a timely manner when it is necessary to  \nutilize over-and-above  funding under the firm-fixed-price contract.  Additionally, it could prevent  \nresolution of design issues identified during testing that could create operational and security issues  \nduring Presidential missions.   \n \nNotification of Delegation of Authorities to the Secretary of  Defense for Military Operations  \nin Cyberspace (Section  1628).   The Administration strongly objects to this provision, as it would \nrequire the Secretary of  Defense to provide Congress with operationally sensitive documents  \nregarding  authorities delegated by  the President to  the Secretary for military operations in  \ncyberspace, including execute orders, a list of countries in which such authorities might be  \nexercised, and defined military objectives  for the  use of such authorities.  This provision would \ninterfere with the established process  for military  operations in cyberspace, unduly hinder  cyber  \noperations, and contravene the President\u2019s constitutional prerogative not to disclose privileged \ninformation, including national security information.  \n \nPilot  Program on  Prosecution of Special Victim Offenses Committed by Attendees of  \nMilitary Service Academies  (Section 538).  The Administration strongly  objects to section 538, \nwhich would outsource  authority for discipline, as well as undermines commander accountability  \nand the chain of  command relationship.  The proposal is inconsistent with one of the fundamental  \nprinciples of the military  justice system since Congress adopted the  Uniform  Code of Military  \nJustice in 1950: uniformity.  Creating  a pilot program where one individual is treated differently  \nthan another charged with the same crime may raise fairness  concerns.   Criminal justice systems  \nshould not be  experiments;  neither should accused service members nor victims be treated as  \nexperiments.  Numerous studies of the exercise of  prosecutorial discretion, including in foreign \nmilitaries that have empowered lawyers to make charging decisions, have  found no resulting  \nbenefit in sexual assault rates, reporting, investigation, or prosecution.  \n \nRestrictions on Detention at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba \n(Sections 1032 and 1033).  The Administration strongly objects to any  restriction on Law of War  \ndetention.  The Administration  fully intends to keep open the detention facility  at GTMO and to \nuse it for detention operations, and DOD has implemented strict global screening criteria that limit \nthe candidates who  are eligible for detention at GTMO.   If transfers to GTMO were prohibited, as  \ncalled for in Section 1033, then, in the future, DOD would be forced to conduct long-term \ndetention of such detainees in-theater or in the continental United States, repatriate them to third  \ncountries, or release detainees.   Furthermore, in certain circumstances, restrictions on the  \n5   \nPresident\u2019s authority to transfer detainees  would violate constitutional separation of powers  \nprinciples, including the  President\u2019s authority  as  Commander in Chief.  \n \nDetention  Facilities at  GTMO (Section 4602).   The Administration appreciates the  authorization \nfor military  construction  of the Communications Facility, and the Detention  Legal Office and  \nCommunications Center at GTMO.  The Administration strongly objects, however, to the  \nexclusion of the High-Value Detention Facility. The President has ordered continued detention \noperations at  GTMO.  The current facility for high-value detainees is experiencing structural  and  \nsystem challenges that, if unaddressed, could pose life and safety  risks to both our guard forces  and \nthe detainees.   \n \nLimitations on Use of Funds  for Providing Housing for Unaccompanied Alien Children \n(UAC)  (Sections 1048 and 1049).  The Administration objects to sections  1048 and 1049 as they  \nmay limit DOD\u2019s ability  to support HHS\u2019s efforts  to house UACs during times of influx. \nAdditionally, section 1049 would require the Secretary of Defense to certify  issues outside the  \npurview of the Secretary  of Defense.  At the request of the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices (HHS), the Secretary of Defense makes  available DOD land  and facilities for use by  \nHHS.   The Secretary of  HHS determines whether such DOD land  and facilities meet HHS  \nrequirements and standards, including those standards established pursuant to the Flores settlement \nagreement.  Additionally, DOD support to HHS is on a reimbursable basis.  DOD does not expend \nDOD funds for this purpose. \n \nProhibition on the Use of Funds to Suspend, Terminate, or Withdraw the United States from  \nthe Open Skies Treaty (Section 1231).   The Administration  strongly objects to this prohibition, \ninsofar as it purports to impinge on the President\u2019s sole constitutional authority to suspend, \nterminate, or withdraw from a treaty.  This authority is not conferred by  and cannot be limited by  \nCongress.  While Congress\u2019s spending power is broad, it cannot be deployed to accomplish \nunconstitutional ends, including through the use of appropriations restrictions to prevent the  \nPresident from exercising his constitutional authority to suspend, terminate, or withdraw from a  \ntreaty.   \n \nReplacement of  Fluorinated Aqueous Film-forming Foam with Fluorine-free Fire-fighting \nAgent (Section 318).  The Administration strongly  objects to this provision, which prohibits DOD  \nfrom using fluorinated fire-fighting  foam before a viable equivalent replacement has been  \nidentified.  DOD continues to pursue aggressively a fluorine-free foam, which must be equivalent  \nin fire-fighting performance and workforce safety as the military specifications.  DOD has  \nconcerns, however, about meeting the 2025 military  specification deadline and the feasibility of  \nwaiver requirements.    \n \nPerfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) and  Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA)  Used on Military  \nInstallations (Section 323).  The Administration strongly objects to this provision, which would \nprovide authority to DOD to treat water sources  or provide replacement water for agricultural  \npurposes where the water source is \u201ccontaminated\u201d with PFOA and PFOS from military  \nactivities.  Using the EPA drinking water health advisory (HA) to identify  areas subject to this  \nsection of the bill would be  inconsistent with the scientific basis of the HA\u2014it was not constructed \nto determine unhealthy levels of PFOA/PFOS in water used for agricultural  purposes or human \n6   \nhealth effects from  consumption of foods produced using agricultural water containing  \nPFOA/PFOS.  Additionally, at potentially  great cost to and significant impact on DOD\u2019s mission, \nthe legislation singles out DOD, only one contributor to this national issue. \n \nBasic Needs Allowance for Low-income Regular Members (Section 602).   The Administration  \nstrongly objects to this provision because it  would be  an unnecessary  entitlement.  Military  \nmembers  receive  appropriate compensation already.  Most junior enlisted  members  receive pay  \nthat is between the 95th and 99th percentiles relative to their private-sector peers.  In addition, this  \nprovision would base the allowance upon a member\u2019s household size, potentially including  \nroommates and unrelated individuals.  The provision would also raise fairness concerns as it would \nexclude members of the  United States Coast Guard, members assigned outside the United States, \nand members of the Active Guard  and Reserve.    \n \nIntegrated  Personnel and Pay System-Army (IPPS-A) (Section 4201).   The Administration  \nstrongly objects to the $43 million reduction in research and development funding from the  FY  \n2020 Budget request in section 4201 for the  IPPS-A.  The reduction effectively  eliminates  IPPS-A  \nfor  approximately 680,000 soldiers serving  in the Regular Army and Reserves and would put the  \nArmy\u2019s number one personnel modernization effort, which is currently being released to the Army  \nNational Guard, with  approximately  another 335,000 members  at significant risk.   IPPS-A \nintegrates human resource capabilities across all components for the first time, and is the vehicle  \nfor the Army\u2019s Talent Management efforts.  The legislation would also delay the fielding of  IPPS-\nA to the Army Reserve and Active Duty from 2021 to 2023, significantly undermining  the Army\u2019s  \nefforts to transform its force, and place  efforts to achieve auditability  at risk.   \n \nAuthority to Provide Assistance to the Vetted  Syrian Opposition (Section 1222).   The \nAdministration strongly  objects to the 15-day waiting period and hold on funds mandated by this  \nprovision.  These requirements would impede DOD\u2019s ability to provide  continuous, uninterrupted \ntraining, and assistance to vetted Syrian Opposition forces, and would have an irreversible  \ndamaging  effect on  the next phases of  DOD\u2019s campaign to defeat  the remaining  ISIS networks in \nthe region.  Furthermore, a requirement to provide Congress  advance notice of military exercises  \nwould contravene the President\u2019s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.   \n \nNational Security Space Launch Program (Section 1601).   The Administration strongly objects  \nto this provision as it would increase mission risk  for the Nation\u2019s national security satellites.   \nAfter careful and considered study,  DOD determined that a contract for national security space \nlaunch requirements over  the course of  five  years  would optimize warfighter flexibility, minimizes  \nmission risk, and provides exceptional value to the taxpayer.  It would also align with the  \nconclusion of the current  generation of several satellite architectures.  Confining Phase 2 to fewer  \nmissions would increase  per-launch cost while simultaneously introducing risk and costs for some  \nintelligence payloads.  Finally, notifying Congress prior to a contract would be a departure  from  \nlong-standing tradition and might put DOD at a  greater risk of a protest.  \n \nNext-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared  (Next-Gen OPIR) (Section 4201).   The \nAdministration strongly  objects to the Committee\u2019s reduction of $376.4 million for the Next-Gen  \nOPIR program as it would delay delivery by three years and increase overall program costs by over  \n$475 million.  \n7   \n \nProhibition on Availability of Funds  for Mobile Variant of Ground-Based Strategic \nDeterrent  Missile (Section 1645).  The Administration objects to the 10-year extension of the \nprohibition on the availability of  funds for  a mobile variant of the  GBSD  missile.   The GBSD will  \nserve as the  ground-based leg of the nuclear triad for decades into the future.  Pursuant to the 2018 \nNPR, a mobile variant of the GBSD is not currently  required to ensure deterrence, but  changes in  \nadversary technology (e.g., a breakthrough in anti-submarine warfare), doctrine, and nuclear force  \nposture may require the  United States to reassess  this determination in the future.  \n \nLimitation on Use of Funds  for Implementation  of Elements of Master Plan for \nRedevelopment of Former Ship Repair Facility in Guam (Section 335).   The Administration  \nobjects to this provision because this funding restriction would impede Navy\u2019s  ability to plan and \nprogram projects necessary to best utilize limited real estate  resources to support future mission  \ngrowth and advanced  warfighting capabilities.  This restriction  would negatively impact Navy\u2019s  \nability to sustain its advantage over peer  competitors, place  warfighters at risk, and create  an  \nuntenable safety risk.    \n \nF-15EX  Aircraft Program  (Section 123).   The Administration  objects to section 123, which \nwould designate the F-15EX as a major subprogram of the F-15.  The designation as a major  \nsubprogram would needlessly delay the fielding of the F-15EX by an  estimated two  years while  \nproviding only marginal  decision-making value to the Milestone Decision Authority  given the  F-\n15EX high level of technology readiness.  The delays  would exacerbate capacity issues  within the  \ntactical aircraft portfolio, prevent the execution of  key nonrecurring engineering and manufacturing  \nactivities, and require operating the less capable F-15C/D longer with its significant structural \nissues and high cost.  The Administration  objects to the proposed limitation on procuring only two \nF-15EX prototypes, and requests full funding  for the first eight F-15EX aircraft.  \n \nUnmanned Surface Vessels (Section 4201).   The Administration objects to the proposed $238 \nmillion reduction to the Large  Unmanned Surface Vessels.  These vessels  are critical  \nexperimentation vessels with modular payloads to reduce  risk, conduct integration and testing of  \npayloads, and develop Navy tactics and concepts  of operations necessary to provide a more  \ndistributed  and lethal force.   \n \nReprioritization of Military Construction  Funding to Unrequested Projects  (Section 4601).  \nThe Administration objects to the bill\u2019s proposed realignment of military construction funding  \nfrom priority projects to other projects not included in the FY 2020 Budget  request.  Contrary to \nthe Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible policy to fully fund projects, the bill proposes to \nincrementally fund 20 military construction projects, effectively  creating  an unfunded obligation of  \n$1.4 billion needed to fully fund these projects over time.  In addition, the  bill would divert $1 \nbillion requested in the FY 2020 Budget to fully fund priority projects, or from rescissions of prior \nyear funds, to other unrequested projects.  \n \nLow-Enriched  Uranium Naval  Nuclear Fuel R&D Program (Section 3118).  The \nAdministration objects to the bill\u2019s direction to establish a program for development of high-\ndensity, low-enriched fuels that could replace highly enriched uranium for naval applications.  In  \n2018, the Secretaries of  Energy and the  Navy jointly determined that the  United States should not  \n8   \npursue research and development of an advanced naval nuclear fuel system based on low-enriched  \nuranium since such a system would result in a reactor design that is inherently less capable, more  \nexpensive, and unlikely to support the significant cost savings  associated with life-of-ship \nsubmarine reactors.  To fully execute a development effort of this magnitude would also incur  \nsignificant risk and compete for resources against other defense priorities.  \n \nNuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response (NCTIR).  The  Administration objects to the  \nbill\u2019s reduction of $32 million from the FY 2020 Budget request for the NCTIR program.  This  \nreduction would compromise NNSA\u2019s ability to speed life-saving  responses to a nuclear incident  \nin the United States.  Under the Capability Forward model, NNSA would provide enhanced \ntraining and equipment to regional Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) teams, enabling them to \nrender safe a nuclear device.  Given the interdependence of  NNSA and FBI in this  initiative, if the  \ntwo agencies\u2019 budgets do not remain synchronized, the timeline for fielding enhanced capabilities  \nto United States  cities will be severely disrupted.  \n \nTimely Disposition of Nonprosecutable Sex-Related Offenses (Section 539).  This provision \nwould be inconsistent with existing statutory  requirements, such as forwarding certain non-referral  \ndecisions regarding sexual assault allegations for  higher-level review, and the Administration \nobjects to its inclusion in the final bill.  The provision would include a 90-day deadline that may  \npreclude command action if  that command action is not concluded within that timeframe,  \npotentially immunizing misconduct.  \n \nExpansion of Special  Victims\u2019 Counsel for Victims of Sex-Related to Domestic Violence \nOffenses (Section 542).  DOD remains committed to eliminating sex-related and domestic \nviolence offenses.  This provision, however, would decrease access for sexual assault victims to  \nSpecial Victims\u2019 Counsels (SVCs)/Victims\u2019  Legal Counsels (VLCs), exacerbate already high  \ncaseloads for SVC/VLCs, and impose an unfunded mandate.   \n \nDefense Acquisition Workforce Certification and Education Requirements (Section 841).  \nThe Administration is concerned the provisions included in section 841 would be  premature and \noverly broad.  DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce is currently subject to requirements of the Defense  \nAcquisition Workforce  Improvement Act (DAWIA).  Rather than create a  new set of standards and \nimpose additional requirements (which would result in increased costs), DOD  would prefer to \ncontinue to evaluate  current workforce needs, and modify the DAWIA  certification program  \naccordingly.      \n \nFederal Transit Dollars (Section 896).  The Administration supports the  efforts of the  \nCommittee, as set forth in section  896, to prevent  financial assistance, specifically  Federal transit  \ndollars, from being used to award a  contract or subcontract for the procurement of passenger  \nrailcars to priority  enterprises owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign states.  \n \nTelecommunications Services and Infrastructure (Section 852).   The  Administration strongly  \nsupports section 852, which would direct the Secretary of Defense to  award  telecommunications  \nservices and infrastructure contracts only to allowed contractors.  This  provision will improve  \nsecurity on outlying  United States  national security  installations by  removing a potential \n9   \nvulnerability from  United States systems and will encourage reciprocity in government  \nprocurement practices.   \n \nProhibition on Operation or  Procurement of Foreign-made Unmanned Aircraft Systems  \n(UAS) (Section 854).   The Administration supports section 854, which would prohibit  \nprocurement by the Secretary of Defense of  UAS manufactured by a  covered foreign country.  The \nAdministration believes  domestic production of these systems is critical for economic and national \nsecurity interests. Reliance on a covered nation for these aircraft systems presents exceptional risk  \nto our supply chains and defense.  The exemption and waiver provisions already in section 854 \naddress many  concerns  with the legislation and the Administration looks forward to working with \nCongress on refining language to include a broader research and development exemption.  \n \nSafe-to-Report  Policy (Sections 549 and 560).  The Administration supports programs to \nminimize barriers to reporting.  However, this provision would provide blanket immunity  and \nmight have the  effect of  undermining the validity  of a victim\u2019s allegations.  Specifically, under this  \nprovision, victims might be subjected to allegations that the report was made merely to escape \ndisciplinary or punitive  action.  This would detract from the victim\u2019s testimony, and might lend \nitself to injecting doubt into the case.  \n \nAfghan Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) (Section 1212).   The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support of the Afghan SIV program  and inclusion of 300 additional visas.  The \nAdministration urges the  Committee, however, to consider including its full request for 4,000 \nAfghan SIVs to ensure continued support of the Afghans who have worked alongside our troops  \nand diplomats.  \n \nForeign Policy and Assistance Related Matters  (Sections 897, 1031, and 1255).   Sections 897, \n1031, and 1255, among other provisions, concern foreign policy  and foreign assistance priorities, \nand while they may advance efforts that the Administration supports, the Administration is  \nconcerned that these provisions do not have a means to ensure in the implementation of these  \nauthorities consistent with United States  foreign policy interests  and to avoid serious unintended \nconsequences.  \n10  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nJuly 15, 2019 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 582 \u2013 Raise the Wage Act \n(Rep. Scott, D-VA, and 205 cosponsors) \nThe Administration opposes H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act.  H.R. 582 would increase the \nFederal minimum wage to $15.00 an hour.  The legislation would also phase out the lower \nminimum wages that apply to newly hired teenagers, end the practice of counting tips toward \nminimum wage obligations, and completely prohibit tip pooling between restaurant servers and \nback-of-the-house staff. \nThrough its successful pro-growth economic agenda, the Administration has ensured that \nAmerican workers are taking home bigger paychecks.  In recent months, the unemployment rate \nhas fallen to its lowest level in nearly a half century, and job openings have risen to a record \nhigh.  There are now more than 1.4 million more job vacancies than there are unemployed \nworkers, and the economy is responding by bringing people from the sidelines and into the \nworkforce.  This strong economy has prompted businesses to remain competitive by raising \nwages.  Compensation is rising at near its fastest pace in a decade. Median household income \nhas reached an all-time high. Wages are also rising faster for production and non-supervisory \nworkers than for workers overall. \nA $15.00 an hour minimum wage would reverse this economic progress and hurt workers.  \nH.R.582 would more than double the Federal minimum wage\u2014raising it 45 percent above its \ninflation-adjusted historical high.  Recent research found Seattle\u2019s $13.00 minimum wage caused \nhiring to fall so much that total wage payments fell across the city, offering a powerful warning \nof the devastating effects a $15.00 Federal minimum wage could have on communities across \nAmerica.  The Congressional Budget Office, for example, recently estimated that H.R. 582 could \neliminate up to 3.7 million jobs.  Further, many workers who remain employed would see their \ncompensation fall as hours are reduced and fringe benefits like vacation time are lost. \nH.R. 582\u2019s changes to tipping rules also would negatively affect restaurant \nemployees.  Preventing tips from counting toward minimum-wage obligations could discourage \ntipping.  Maine and Washington, D.C., recently repealed similar policies after servers protested \nthat they would cut their pay. Relatedly, this legislation would disrupt well-established \ncompensation structures by prohibiting cooks and dishwashers from sharing in the tips their \noften unseen work helps generate. \nThe successful efforts to reduce taxes, eliminate regulations, and implement fairer trade deals are \ndriving economic growth and increasing workers\u2019 take-home pay far more effectively and  efficiently than legislation like H.R. 582, which would eliminate jobs and reduce total wages for \nAmerican workers. \nIf H.R. 582 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he veto it. \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n May 7, 2019   \n (House Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 986 \u2013 Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019  \n(Rep. Kuster, D-NH, and 19 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 986.  This legislation would nullify  \nAdministration guidance  on section 1332 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  \n(PPACA).  This guidance, issued on October 24, 2018, by the Department of Health and Human \nServices and the Department of the Treasury,  expanded State flexibility,  encouraging  States to  \npursue section 1332 waivers to move their insurance markets away  from  PPACA\u2019s  one-size-fits-\nall rules and regulations and increase choice and  competition within their insurance markets.  \nThe President has repeatedly made clear that this Administration will protect people with pre-\nexisting conditions.  The 2018 guidance in no way alters the  guardrails in place for those with \npre-existing conditions, and it would not allow the Administration to waive  the requirements  in \nplace around pre-existing conditions.  The title of this legislation gives the  misleading impression  \nthat it will enhance healthcare protections for  Americans with pre-existing  conditions.  Members  \nshould not be confused.  This bill would not extend any  additional protections for people with \npre-existing conditions.  Rather, it would harm the ability of States to improve coverage  for  \npeople both with and without pre-existing conditions.  \nCoverage in the individual market has become  increasingly unaffordable  for unsubsidized \nconsumers, including those with pre-existing conditions.  The 2018 guidance freed States to \ndevelop health coverage that best meets the needs  of their residents, to better enable  all \nAmericans  to have the opportunity to gain high-value and affordable health  coverage regardless  \nof income, geography, age, gender, or health status.  It  empowers States to develop innovative  \napproaches that transcend the inflexible  Federal approach,  increase consumer control, and \nexpand choice and competition in their markets.  The guidance issued by the previous  \nadministration  in 2015 substantially and unnecessarily limited the types of proposals that could \nbe approved for section 1332 waivers, effectively  limiting States\u2019 ability to innovate and \nimpairing their  ability to  meet all the challenges  they  face in providing quality  health coverage to \ntheir residents.  \nH.R. 986 would reverse State efforts to develop innovative waiver proposals  and limit the  \nAdministration\u2019s  ability to  provide  guidance to States about the flexibilities  available  under  the \nlaw.  It would move the healthcare market in the wrong direction.  The legislation  threatens  \naccess to healthcare for our Nation\u2019s citizens and runs counter to the President\u2019s  healthcare \nvision of expanding affordable coverage, improving care  for people with pre-existing conditions, \nand enhancing  competition.  \nIf H.R. 986 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. \n** * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nJune 24, 2019 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R.3351 \u2014 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2020 \n(Rep. Lowey, D-NY) \nThe Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3351, making appropriations for financial \nservices and general government for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2020, and for \nother purposes.  The Administration is strongly opposed to the budgetary framework that \nunderlies this and other appropriations bills being considered by the House of Representatives.  \nThis framework would raise the discretionary spending caps by more than $350 billion in fiscal \nyears (FY) 2020 and 2021 and does not reflect either a House-passed budget resolution or a \nbipartisan, bicameral agreement.  It would put the Federal Government on track to add nearly \n$2 trillion to deficits over 10 years, adding significantly to the national debt, which is already \nmore than $22 trillion and rising.   \nIn addition, the House Democrats\u2019 framework continues to adhere to the misguided and \nunfounded notion that increases to defense spending must be matched or exceeded by increases \nto non-defense spending.  In fact, the appropriations bills under consideration would provide \nmore than twice as much additional funding in FY 2020 for non-defense programs as for defense \nprograms, relative to FY 2019 levels.  Investing in our national security remains a key \nAdministration priority, but strengthening our defense does not require additional non-defense \ndiscretionary spending.  \nOverall, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would appropriate $25.0 billion, \nwhich is $0.4 billion, or 1.6 percent, above the FY 2020 Budget request and $1.8 billion above \nthe FY 2019 enacted level.  In addition, this legislation includes a number of particularly \nproblematic provisions implicating key Administration priorities, including provisions that \nwould restrict the Administration\u2019s ability to secure the southern border, impose restrictions on \nthe Administration\u2019s management of the Executive Branch, and allow for Government-funded \nabortions in the District of Columbia.  \nIf H.R. 3351 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he veto it. \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nbill. \nDepartment of the Treasury \nBorder Security Infrastructure. The Administration believes that it is essential to fully secure the \nborder, the bedrock of a functioning immigration system.  Language in section 126 of the bill  would severely undermine the Administration\u2019s efforts to do so by restricting the use of certain \namounts in the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.  Such amounts are permanently authorized for law \nenforcement activities of any Federal agency.  The Administration strongly opposes this \nlanguage, which would hamstring the development of border security infrastructure. \nCommittee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).  The Administration appreciates \nthat the bill provides sufficient resources to support anticipated increases in CFIUS caseload \nvolumes and the investments required to successfully implement the Foreign Investment Risk \nReview Modernization Act of 2018. \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The Administration is \ndisappointed that the bill provides $286 million above the amount requested in the FY 2020 \nBudget for the CDFI Fund.  The Federal Government should not be allocating taxpayer funds to \nthe mature CDFI industry, which should have ready access to private capital.  The requested \namount of $14 million is sufficient to support ongoing CDFI Fund activities. \nExecutive Office of the President \nPoverty Measure. The Administration strongly opposes language in section 634 of the bill that \nwould preclude funds from being used to make changes to the Official Poverty Measure.  The \nprovision would prevent the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from completing its \nstatutory responsibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and would also undermine \nthe established process for reviewing and updating these standards, which is intended to ensure \nthe objectivity and relevance of Federal statistical data. \nApportionment Reporting. The Administration strongly objects to section 204 of the bill that \nwould require OMB to create an automated system and website through which each OMB-\napproved apportionment would be publicly posted, and would require OMB to provide a \nmonthly report to the appropriations committees documenting all apportionment requests that \nhave been with OMB for 30 days or more without being approved. This reporting requirement is \nunnecessarily onerous as it would require thousands of documents to be posted online each year. \nRestrictions on Withholding under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA).  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 750 of the bill which would prohibit withholding from \nobligation any budget authority proposed for rescission or deferral pursuant to the ICA within 60 \ndays of the expiration of that budget authority.  In addition, this provision would treat any \nviolation of this prohibition as if it were an Antideficiency Act violation. This provision would \nundermine long-standing budget law and impinge on the President\u2019s ability to exercise fiscal \nmanagement of the Executive Branch, including by proposing rescissions. \nSupervision of the Executive Branch.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill includes \ncertain provisions that seek to interfere with the President\u2019s supervision of the Executive Branch, \nsuch as one purporting to bar OMB from expending funds to alter the annual work plan of the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, in contravention of the separation of powers between the Executive \nBranch and the Congress. \n2  General Services Administration (GSA) \nFederal Buildings Fund (FBF). The Administration is disappointed that the bill continues to \nunderfund the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) capital program.  The diversion of \nreceipts fails to provide Federal agencies with the commercial equivalent space and services that \nagencies pay for in rent.  The bill fails to fund critical construction, renovation, and consolidation \npriorities within the FBF capital program, including the next phase of construction at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security\u2019s consolidated headquarters at St. Elizabeths. Since FY 2011, \nthe Congress has redirected approximately $8 billion in GSA rent receipts to other congressional \npriorities. \nFederal Capital Revolving Fund. The Administration continues to support the establishment of a \nFederal Capital Revolving Fund (FCRF), a new budgetary mechanism for large civilian real \nproperty projects. The Administration transmitted legislative language in June 2018 and looks \nforward to working with the Congress to enact the FCRF proposal. \nFederal Information Technology (IT) Modernization. The Administration appreciates the \ncontinued support for the Technology Modernization Fund with an increase in funding over \nFY2019 enacted levels.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the full \n$150 million requested level, which would support a more rapid transition of legacy systems and \nthe adoption of more commercial technology. \nSmall Business Administration (SBA) \nEntrepreneurial Development Programs. The Administration is concerned that the bill provides \n$282 million in funding for SBA entrepreneurial development programs, $100 million above the \nFY 2020 Budget request.  In addition, the Administration is disappointed that the Congress has \nfailed to include the reforms proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request to create a competitive set-\naside for the Small Business Development Centers program and to allow for data sharing, which \nwould enable the program to better measure and evaluate effectiveness. \nDistrict of Columbia (D.C.) \nD.C. Restrictions. The Administration strongly objects to section 802 of the bill which would \namend a previously-enacted provision and would allow for Government-funded abortion in D.C. \nSchool Improvement. The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides less for School \nImprovement than the FY 2020 Budget request; the $53 million provided is $38 million less than \nthe FY 2020 Budget request.  The requested funding is needed to meet family demand for the \nD.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) and provide additional support for D.C. public \nschools and public charter schools.  Instead, the bill would continue to provide funding for the \npoorly-targeted Tuition Assistance Grants program.  In addition, the Administration is concerned \nthat the bill requires private schools participating in the OSP to certify with the Department of \nEducation that they comply with Federal requirements for which they do not receive funds to \nimplement.  The unprecedented application of such requirements would severely limit private \nschools\u2019 ability to participate in OSP and therefore seriously reduce the number of high-quality \n3  educational options to which disadvantaged D.C. families have access. \nOther Independent Agencies \nNational Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  The Administration appreciates the \ninclusion of the $22 million requested to implement NARA\u2019s electronic records initiative, which \nis part of the Administration\u2019s Government Reform Plan.  These funds would help NARA \nmodernize its work processes and accelerate important electronic records activities. \nPublic Buildings Reform Board (PBRB). The bill fails to fund PBRB and the Asset Proceeds and \nSpace Management Fund, both of which were established under Federal Asset Sales and \nTransfer Act of 2016.  The Board recently began operations, given that a sufficient number of \nBoard members have been appointed and, absent appropriations in FY 2020, the PBRB would be \nunable to carry out its mission. \nElection Assistance Commission. The Administration is disappointed that the bill includes $600 \nmillion in unrequested funds for additional election security grants to States.  Securing election \ninfrastructure is a partnership between Federal, State, and local governments and private sector \nentities.  States have only begun to expend the $380 million received for election security grants \nin FY 2018.  Additional support from the Federal Government should only be provided once \nexisting funds have been deployed. \nOther Issues \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) Reorganization. The Administration continues to stress \nstructural and organizational reform at OPM, and strongly opposes the inclusion of language in \nsection 632 of the bill prohibiting the merger of OPM with GSA. Reform is needed to better \nalign resources with mission and create long-term stability, sustainability, and increased \noperational excellence.  In addition, the Administration is also concerned with language in this \nsection prohibiting interagency agreements between GSA and OPM.  Interagency agreements are \nroutinely entered into by agencies for cross-agency support and are mission-critical for OPM to \ncontinue to operate.  As worded, the provision would create increased risk of IT system failures, \nincluding those with sensitive information concerning current and former Federal employees and \ntheir families. \nAcross-the-Board Civilian Pay Increase.  The Administration continues to support the alignment \nof pay with strategic human capital objectives.  A 3.1 percent pay increase presents long-term \nfixed costs, yet fails to address the most strategic human capital issues facing the Federal \nworkforce. \nCollective Bargaining Agreements (CBA).  The Administration strongly opposes section 749, \nwhich prevents agencies from addressing language in their CBAs that violate Government-wide \nrequirements and limits the authority of the Federal Service Impasses Panel to resolve bargaining \nimpasses. By stipulating that a CBA shall remain in full force and effect until a new bargaining \nagreement is reached through mutual consent, this provision effectively traps agencies and forces \nthem to remain party to agreements that do not advance the effectiveness or efficiency of the \n4  agency\u2019s mission. \nPublic-Private Competition. The Administration is disappointed that the bill continues the \nmoratorium preventing agencies from using public-private competition as a tool for determining \nwhether specific work of the Government should be performed by Federal workers or \ncontractors.  Such a tool would enable more efficient use of resources, helping to achieve \nimportant goals of the Administration, including those laid out in the President\u2019s Management \nAgenda. \nConstitutional Concerns \nCertain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, a provision purporting \nto bar OMB from expending funds to alter the annual work plan of the Army Corps of Engineers \nwould interfere with the President\u2019s supervision of the Executive Branch, a necessary feature of \nhis constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.  Other provisions would \ncontravene the constitutional separation of powers between the Executive Branch and the \nCongress, and still another could infringe on the President\u2019s constitutional authority to control \nthe disclosure of information that is subject to executive privilege.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to address these concerns. \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2020 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n* * * * * * * \n5  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nDecember 3, 2019 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4 \u2013 Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019 \n(Rep. Sewell, D-AL, and 229 cosponsors) \nThe Administration opposes passage of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019.  \nH.R. 4 would amend the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 by imposing a new coverage formula \nand transparency obligations on States and local jurisdictions regarding their elections.  These \namendments raise serious policy concerns because the Federal Government would be granted \nexcessive control over State and local election practices.  Additionally, the Supreme Court has \nalready held similar restrictions imposed by Congress on States and localities to be \nunconstitutional.  \nNo individual should be denied or deterred from exercising his or her right to vote.  Federal law \nprotects against voting discrimination, allows judicial review of State and local voting laws, and \nestablishes preclearance requirements. H.R. 4 would overreach by giving the Federal \nGovernment too much authority over an even greater number of voting practices and decisions \nmade by States and local governments without justifying the current needs for such policies. \nSection 3 of H.R. 4 would amend the VRA by setting forth a new coverage formula that subjects \ncertain States and local subdivisions to Federal preclearance requirements before undertaking \ncertain election activities.  For example, the coverage formula would place restrictions on States \nwith \u201c15 or more voting rights violations [that] occurred in . . . the previous 25 calendar years.\u201d \nOnce a State or locality is covered by the formula, it would need permission from the Attorney \nGeneral or Federal courts before conducting certain election activities prescribed by the bill.   \nIn striking down the VRA\u2019s prior coverage formula, the Supreme Court held that although \u201c[o]ur \ncountry has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must \nensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\u201d Shelby \nCounty v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 557 (2013).  Accordingly, the coverage formula set forth in \nsection 3 of H.R. 4 that \u201cimposes substantial federalism costs\u201d on States must therefore be \ntailored to \u201ccurrent needs.\u201d Id. at 540, 553 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, section 3 \ncontinues to permit reliance on potentially decades-old data\u2014incidents dating as far back as 25 \nyears\u2014as a justification for imposing a preclearance requirement.  \nAdditionally, section 4 of H.R. 4 would create a new \u201cPractice-Based Preclearance\u201d standard, \nwhich would automatically subject certain election laws to Federal preclearance, thereby raising \nsignificant policy concerns.  This section would, among other things, prejudice Federal law  against State and local voter integrity efforts, such as voter ID laws, and even impose \nrequirements on routine administrative actions that include changing voting locations. \nFinally, H.R. 4 would amend the VRA by imposing additional transparency requirements \nregarding certain election activities in Federal, State, and local jurisdictions.  Section 5 of H.R. 4 \nraises constitutional concerns because its broad language would interfere with State and local \nelections beyond the powers afforded by the Elections Clause.  Specifically, section 5 would \nrequire notice of demographic information related to \u201cany change in the constituency that will \nparticipate in an election for Federal, State, or local office.\u201d  This broad language would impose \nnotice requirements on States that make redistricting changes despite no Federal election \ninvolvement.  By doing so, H.R. 4 would impermissibly grant Congress authority beyond what is \nauthorized by the Elections Clause, and therefore section 5 would likely be found \nunconstitutional.    \nIn sum, several provisions of H.R. 4 violate principles of federalism and exceed the powers \ngranted to Congress by the Constitution, and these provisions would likely be found unlawful if \nchallenged.  Accordingly, the Administration opposes H.R. 4. \nIf H.R. 4 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nMarch 2, 2020 \n(House Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1140 \u2013 Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2020  \n(Rep.

The current personnel system authorized by the \nAviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) just months after the September 11th attacks \nprovides the flexibility TSA needs so that it can quickly and efficiently adjust its workforce \nmanagement to respond to emerging threats or national emergencies.

We are committed to \nproviding TSA\u2019s employees with competitive compensation and benefits.

The President\u2019s budget proposal allows \nfor predictable pay progression and provides funding for merit-based pay increases for high-\nperforming TSOs.  It optimizes existing authorities and properly resources ongoing workforce \ninitiatives.  As such, the President\u2019s budget better meets the needs of TSA, its workforce, and \ntaxpayers than H.R. 1140. \nIf H.R. 1140 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nOctober 22, 2019 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2513 \u2013 Corporate Transparency Act of 2019, as amended by Manager\u2019s Amendment \n(Rep.

This joint resolution relates to $3 billion in Foreign Military \nSales (FMS) to Qatar for twenty-four AH-64E Apache Attack helicopters.  This package is \nintended for the sovereign defense of Qatar, which is host to United States Central Command \nforces and serves as a critical forward-deployed location in the region.  In addition to the military \npersonnel in Qatar, more than 15,000 United States citizens live on the Qatar Peninsula.  The \nFMS case at issue supports the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United \nStates by improving the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important partner \nfor political and economic progress in the Middle East.  This FMS transaction will enhance long-\nterm defensive and offensive capabilities on the Qatar Peninsula, as well as the protection of key \noil and gas infrastructure and platforms.

The United States  forces that have been threatened by  Iranian and  Iran-backed  \nattacks  in  Iraq  are there to combat terrorist  groups such as ISIS.  H.R. 2456 would undermine \ntheir ability to execute this mission, and the President\u2019s ability to defend United States  forces and  \ninterests in the region against ongoing threats from Iran and Iranian-sponsored proxies.

Res. 7 \u2013 Directing the President to Remove  United States Armed Forces from  \nHostilities in the Republic of Yemen that Have Not Been Authorized by Congress  \n(Sen. Sanders, I-VT and 19  cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res 7,  a joint resolution that purports to \ndirect the President to remove United States forces  from hostilities in or  affecting the Republic of  \nYemen, with certain exceptions.   \nThe premise of the joint resolution is flawed. Since 2015, the United States has provided limited \nsupport to member countries of the Saudi-led  coalition, including intelligence sharing, logistics  \nsupport, and, until recently, aerial refueling, to  assist in the defense of United States  allies and \npartners. The provision of this support has not caused United States  forces  to be introduced into \nhostilities.  Such support is provided pursuant to licenses and approvals under the Arms Export \nControl Act, statutory authorities for Department  of Defense to provide logistics support to \nforeign countries, and the President\u2019s constitutional powers. Because the President has directed  \nUnited States forces to support the Saudi-led coalition under his constitutional powers, the joint \nresolution would raise serious constitutional concerns to the extent it seeks to override the \nPresident\u2019s determination as Commander in Chief. \nIn addition to its erroneous premise, the joint resolution would harm bilateral relationships in the  \nregion, negatively  affect  our ability to prevent the spread of violent extremist organizations\u2014 \nsuch as al-Qa\u2019ida in the  Arabian Peninsula and  ISIS in Yemen\u2014and establish bad  precedent  for  \nfuture legislation  by  defining \u201chostilities\u201d to include defense cooperation such as aerial refueling  \nfor purposes of this legislation.

This legislation would \nnullify the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rule on \u201cRestoring Internet Freedom,\u201d \n83 Fed. Reg. 7852 (February 22, 2018).  Last year, the FCC returned to the light-touch \nregulatory scheme that enabled the internet to develop and thrive for nearly two decades by \npromoting internet freedom and encouraging network investment.  Since the new rule was \nadopted in 2018, consumers have benefited from a greater than 35 percent increase in average, \nfixed broadband download speeds, and the United States rose to sixth, from thirteenth, in the \nworld for those speeds.

This bill  would expand the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s  (CFPB)  already \nbroad authority over credit reporting agencies and create an unnecessary position of a credit \nreporting ombudsperson  within the CFPB.  Additionally, H.R. 5332 would require large \nconsumer credit  reporting agencies to create an online consumer portal on which all  advertising, \nmarketing, and solicitation would be banned.  This  ban on commercial speech appears to lack a  \nsufficiently  compelling justification,  which the Constitution requires.   \nThe Administration has worked in a bipartisan manner to improve the consumer credit reporting \nsystem.  In May 2018, President Trump signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and \nConsumer Protection Act (Public Law 115-174), which included an important  amendment to the \nFair Credit  Reporting Act and helped lead to a historically strong economy with low \nunemployment and rising wages.  These and other measures have proven successful, and the  \nAdministration stands ready to work in a bipartisan manner to take similar actions that are in line \nwith its core principles, as outlined in Executive Order 13772,  for regulation and do not \nunnecessarily expand the size of government.  \nIf H.R. 5332  were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \n June 29, 2020  \n (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1425 \u2013 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act  \n(Rep. Craig, D-MN, and 61 cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1425.  This bill attempts to exploit \nthe coronavirus pandemic to resuscitate tired, partisan proposals that would send hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to insurance companies in order to paper over serious flaws in \nObamacare.  Furthermore, H.R. 1425 would pay for this bailout by imposing price controls that \nundermine the American innovation the entire globe is depending on to deliver the vaccines and \ntherapeutics needed to respond to the coronavirus. \nSince the beginning of this crisis, the Administration has taken a whole-of-America approach to \nfight the coronavirus.  This includes a productive partnership with both houses of Congress to \nrespond to the healthcare needs of our citizens.  The Administration has delivered millions of \npieces of personal protective equipment to frontline healthcare responders, surged hospital \ncapacity, and dramatically scaled up diagnostic and surveillance testing capabilities.  The \nAdministration also launched Operation Warp Speed to collaborate with the private sector to \ndevelop a coronavirus vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostics.  Additionally, the Administration is \nworking to reimburse providers for coronavirus testing and treatment of uninsured Americans so \nthey do not have to worry about the financial implications of obtaining these services.  \nAll this was done while putting the country in the strongest possible position to rebound from the \nmost significant economic challenge since the Great Depression.  Working with Congress, the \nAdministration has delivered financial relief directly to over 160 million Americans, over \n4.5 million businesses and their employees, and over one million healthcare providers. \nInstead of building on these vital, bipartisan efforts, H.R. 1425 reads as if the coronavirus never \nemerged.  It repurposes failed proposals from years past that would literally pay insurance \ncompanies more to hide the true cost of Obamacare from consumers.  Even the additional \nbillions of taxpayer funding is not enough to prop up Obamacare on its own, thus H.R. 1425 goes \nout of its way to systematically eliminate any competition by prohibiting more affordable \ncoverage options and the consideration of alternative approaches by States.  At the same time, \nthe bill lacks any provision to ensure the Federal Government adheres to the long-held consensus \nto not fund abortion services or abortion coverage. \nTo create a fa\u00e7ade of \u201cpaying\u201d for the revival of last decade\u2019s most partisan project, Obamacare, \nH.R. 1425 invokes another partisan misadventure reflected in provisions of H.R. 3.  In its \nStatement of Administration Policy on H.R. 3, the Administration explained that these provisions  would impose price controls under the guise of \u201cnegotiation\u201d that would ultimately \u201charm  \nseniors and all who need lifesaving medicines.\u201d  In perhaps an indication of the intentions of \nH.R. 1425, it does not even attempt to include those provisions of H.R. 3 that had previously \ngarnered bipartisan support, such as establishing a cap on out-of-pocket expenses for all \nbeneficiaries in Medicare Part D and other improvements to that program for seniors. \n \nWhile any time is an inopportune time to dramatically undermine the development of innovative \nmedicines, H.R. 1425 is even more imprudent given the current focus on developing vaccines \nand therapeutics rapidly to help America and the world combat the coronavirus.  To take such an \naction simply to double down on the same expensive, inefficient, and bureaucratic approach to \nhealth coverage that the American people endured for the past decade makes it even more \nmisguided and counter to the most urgent needs of the country. \n \nIf H.R. 1425 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nJuly 21, 2020  \n  (House)  \nS A P  \nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 6395 \u2013  William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2021  \n(Rep. Smith D-WA, and Rep. Thornberry R-TX)  \nThe Administration strongly supports enactment of a National Defense Authorization Act \n(NDAA) for a 60th  consecutive year. It is also grateful for  the strong, bipartisan work this year \nby the House Armed Services Committee (Committee) on behalf of America\u2019s national defense. \nThe Administration applauds the Committee\u2019s bipartisan support for a national defense \ndiscretionary topline of $740.5  billion, which is  consistent with the President\u2019s Fiscal Year (FY) \n2021 Budget Request  and the Bipartisan Budget  Act of 2019,  and for the  Committee\u2019s  full \nsupport of the President\u2019s Active Duty Forces end-strength request. Such consistent funding and \nend-strength numbers will further enable irreversible  implementation of the National Defense \nStrategy\u2019s  (NDS)  key lines of effort:  (1) Sustaining and building readiness to deter, fight, and \nwin; (2) Strengthening alliances, deepening interoperability, and attracting  new partners; (3) \nReforming the Department of Defense (DOD) for greater performance and accountability; and \n(4) Supporting the backbone of America\u2019s national security \u2013  our service members, military \nfamilies, and DOD  civilians. \nNevertheless, H.R. 6395 includes several provisions that present serious concerns. Among other \nmajor provisions, the Administration strongly objects to section 2829, which would require \nrenaming of certain military institutions. It also has serious concerns about provisions of the bill \nthat seek to micromanage aspects of the executive branch\u2019s authority, impose highly prescriptive \nlimitations on the use of funds for Afghanistan, and otherwise constrain the President\u2019s authority \nto protect national security interests. Many of these provisions would pose significant challenges \nto continued execution of the NDS.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress  to address its significant concerns \nwith  these aspects of the bill,  the most significant of which are discussed  below. The \nAdministration also looks forward to reviewing the classified annex to the committee report and \nworking with Congress to address any concerns about classified programs.  \nIf H.R. 6395 were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto it.  \n1 Renaming Certain Military Installations and Other Defense Property (Section 2829). The \nAdministration strongly objects to section  2829  of the bill, which  would require  renaming of any \nmilitary installation or defense property named after any person who served in the political or \nmilitary leadership of any armed rebellion against the United States. Over the years, these \nlocations have taken on significance to the American story and those  who have helped write it  \nthat far transcends their namesakes. The Administration respects the legacy of the millions of \nAmerican servicemen and women who have served with honor at these military bases, and who \nfrom these locations have fought and died in two World Wars, Vietnam, the War on Terror, and \nother conflicts. Further, the drive to rename will not stop at the limits written into section 2829. \nSection 2829  is part of a sustained effort to erase from the history of the Nation those  who do not \nmeet an  ever-shifting standard of conduct. Beyond section 2829, loud voices in America are also \ndemanding the  destruction or renaming of monuments and memorials to former Presidents, \nincluding the our first President, George Washington;  the author of the Declaration of \nIndependence, Thomas Jefferson;  and the Great Emancipator, Abraham Lincoln.  President \nTrump has been clear in his opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to rewrite \nhistory and to displace the enduring legacy of the American Revolution with a new left-wing \ncultural  revolution.   \nModification and Clarification of Construction Authority in the Event of a Declaration of  \nWar or National Emergency (Section 2801).  The Administration strongly objects to section \n2801 because it would significantly curtail the authority of DOD under 10 U.S.C. 2808 by \nimposing spending caps, limiting the source of funds, constraining the Secretary of Defense\u2019s \nability to waive laws that impede expeditious response to an emergency, and imposing \nburdensome congressional reporting requirements. Section 2808 was originally enacted to allow \nfor the adjustment of military construction priorities in the event of a declaration of war or \nnational emergency, and this section would greatly restrict that ability. These arbitrary limits \nincrease risks to the Armed Forces and the national security of the United States.  \nRequirement of Consent of the Chief Executive Officer for Certain Full-time National \nGuard Duty Performed in a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia (Section 513). The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 513, which would grant the Mayor of the District of \nColumbia the authority to deny the President the use of the District of Columbia National Guard \nunder  the authority of  32 U.S.C. 502(f)(2)(A). This provision would alter how the District of \nColumbia National Guard is administered and employed under current statute and Executive \nOrders. Currently, the Mayor of the District of Columbia has no authority over the District of  \nColumbia National Guard. This provision would  grant the Mayor authority over certain uses of \nthe District of Columbia National Guard. This is particularly problematic in circumstances when \nit becomes necessary for the President, the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of the  Army to \nuse the District of Columbia National Guard under  the authority of section  502(f)(2)(A) to \nsupport Federal  law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia or to defend the seat of the \nUnited States Government.  \nForce Reduction in Afghanistan Limitations (Section 1213). The Administration strongly \nobjects to section 1213\u2019s highly prescriptive limitations on the use of funds for Afghanistan and \nits measures to reduce  forces  in  Afghanistan, until the Secretary of Defense, with the \nconcurrence of the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the \n2 Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Commander of U.S. Central Command, the Commander of U.S. \nForces\u2014Afghanistan, and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United \nNations,  submits a report certifying that they will not harm counterterror operations, risk United \nStates  personnel, or  increase risk of expanding terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan. It would also \ncontravene the President\u2019s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. This provision would \nrestrict  the President from discharging his  Constitutional  authority to reduce forces levels in \nAfghanistan if he deems it necessary. It also would subordinate the President\u2019s authority to the  \ndiscretion of the officials whose concurrence would be required for the certification. Further, by \nrequiring the concurrence of three military officers  for the certification, the provision also would  \nsubordinate the Secretary of Defense\u2019s discretion to the judgment of those military subordinates, \nupending the military chain of command and the principle of civilian control of the military.    \nForce Reduction in Germany Limitations (Section 1241).  The Administration affirms the  \ninherent need for a ready presence in the European theater, but it  strongly objects to section \n1241. This section  would prohibit the closure of any base  or facility under the European \nConsolidation Initiative until  the Secretary of Defense can certify that there is no longer a need \nfor a rotational military  presence in the European theater. The constraint on reducing the \nnumbers of active duty service members would also contravene the President\u2019s authority as \nCommander in Chief.   \nUnited States participation in the Open Skies Treaty (Section 1234).  The Administration is \ndeeply concerned by the highly prescriptive text  mandating joint notification by the Secretaries  \nof Defense and State on the conclusion of agreements to secure notifications of observational \noverflights from countries  that host  United States  military forces, and reports on such agreements  \nand where the United State  did not secure them. The provision also requires the sharing of \nimagery and reporting on diplomatic exchanges that are within the prerogative of the executive \nbranch  to protect.  \nIndo-Pacific Reassurance Initiative  (IPRI)  (Section 1251).  The Administration supports the \nCommittee\u2019s intent to emphasize our deep commitment to defending our interests and those of \nour allies in the Indo-Pacific region. The Administration looks forward to working with the \nCommittee on IPRI to prioritize our investments,  maintain a  credible deterrent, and demonstrate \nan enduring, whole-of-government commitment to the region, but does have some concerns that \nthis provision may limit  DOD\u2019s  flexibility to adjust to an evolving regional security \nenvironment, and looks  forward to further discussions with Congress  on these matters.  \nDiversity  and Inclusion  (Section  912).  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s  \nsupport for DOD\u2019s  strong commitment to advancing equal opportunity, diversity, and inclusion \nthroughout our Armed Forces. In light of the initiatives already being implemented  at Secretary \nEsper\u2019s direction, the Administration strongly objects to section  912, which would create four \nnew presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed (PAS) officials who would compete  directly  \nwith the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and the Assistant Secretaries  \nof the Military Departments for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. This bifurcation of  \nresponsibility would add unnecessary bureaucracy and internal competition into this critical area \nat a time when a focused effort is needed, and is already underway at the highest  levels of DOD  \nand the U.S. Coast Guard.  \n3  \nLimitations on Use of Funds in the National Defense Sealift Fund  (Section 1022).  The \nAdministration objects to section 1022. While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  \nsupport to procure additional used vessels for the sealift mission, the Administration urges  \nremoval of  the requirement to procure new construction sealift vessels. This will allow the \nAdministration to begin the necessary step of recapitalizing the sealift fleet for a fraction of the \ncost of procuring new vessels.  \n \nCoordination in Transfer of Funds by DOD  to National Nuclear Security Administration \n(Section 1641).  The Administration objects to section 1641, which attempts to micromanage the \nexecutive branch\u2019s budget formulation for the Department of Energy\u2019s  (DOE)  National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration (NNSA). The Secretary of Defense does not transfer \u201cnuclear budget \nrequest  authority\u201d to the NNSA. The President is  responsible for  managing  the executive branch \nbudget formulation process and determines requested levels for  resources among competing \npriorities and departments.  \n \nAdvanced Naval Nuclear Fuel System  Based on Low-Enriched Uranium (Section 3116).  \nThe Administration objects to the bill\u2019s direction to establish a program to assess  the viability of \nusing low-enriched uranium in naval nuclear reactors. In 2018, the Secretary  of Energy and the  \nSecretary of the Navy jointly determined that the United States should not  pursue such research  \nand development  because  such a system  would be  far less capable  and  more expensive  than \ncurrent reactor designs.  \n \nFormally Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program  (Section 3103).  The Administration objects \nto section 3103 because it would reduce DOE funding for the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial \nAction Program  (FUSRAP), thereby rejecting the Budget proposal to transition administration of  \nthe program. The Administration urges the House  to move the  FUSRAP  from the Department of \nthe Army  to DOE. Transferring responsibility of this program to DOE will facilitate more \nefficient cleanup of these contaminated sites  by the Army Corps of Engineers, allow DOE to \nconsider  the full range of cleanup responsibilities in prioritizing work, reduce the costs of  \nactivities now undertaken by both agencies, and simplify the process for transferring these sites  \nback to DOE for long-term surveillance and maintenance.  \n \nInformation and Intelligence Exclusions  (Sections  1631-1632 and 1712).  The Administration \nsupports  the intent of sections  1631, 1632, and 1712. These sections, however, do not  adequately \nreflect the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s statutory responsibility to protect intelligence \nsources and methods with regard to cybersecurity threat intelligence related to information \nsystems operated by agencies within the Intelligence Community. With respect  to section 1631, \nthe Administration supports appropriate collaboration on cyber threat  information within the \nUnited States  Government. The Administration, however,  strongly objects to the lack of an opt-\nout provision reasonably tailored to address sources and methods information sharing related to \nsuch systems. With respect to section 1632, the Administration expects to use  the rulemaking \nauthority in subsection (e)  to address similar concerns. Finally, the Administration strongly \nobjects to  section 1712, which  would  lead to the potential disclosure in public reports of \nclassified information and information relating to intelligence sources  and methods. It should be \nnoted, however, that the  National Archives and Records Administration has already done much \nof what is contemplated in section 1712 under its existing authorities. In order to protect  \n \n4  \nintelligence sources and methods related to such systems, the Administration looks forward to \nworking with Congress to craft appropriate exclusions.  \n \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Space and Strategic  Deterrence Policy  (Section 921). The \nAdministration is grateful for the continued partnership with Congress in standing up the Space \nForce as our Nation\u2019s newest military branch. The Administration, however, strongly objects to \nadding nuclear deterrence and missile defense responsibilities to the responsibilities of the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy. The Administration is finishing the statutorily \nrequired study directed in the FY  2020 NDAA and looks forward to working with Congress on \nthe most efficient and impactful roles and responsibilities of the new office.  \n \nMilitary Construction Infrastructure and Weapon System Synchronization for Ground-\nBased Strategic Deterrent (Section 2404).  The Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s  \ngeneral approach in section 2404 to provide some of the flexibility requested by the \nAdministration for Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent launch facility and launch center \nconversion activities.  In order to keep these critical projects on time and on budget,  however,  the \nAdministration requests that Congress provide the authority to use RDT&E and Missile \nProcurement funding to carry out the construction and conversion projects.   \n \nLimitations on Divestiture and Retirement (Sections 122-125, 1045, and 1047).  The \nAdministration strongly objects to language in sections 122 (RC-135), 123 (E-8), 124 (RQ-4), \n125 (KC-135, KC-10), 1045 (EQ-4), and 1047 (A-10) that limits DOD\u2019s ability to divest or retire \nspecific platforms. The President\u2019s  Budget divests or  retires platforms to reinvest in leading-edge  \ninnovation, ensuring dominance across all domains: air, land, sea, space and cyber. Limiting \nDOD\u2019s flexibility to prioritize resource investment delays modernization of capabilities, \npreparation for great power competition, and implementation of the NDS.  \n \nBombers (Section 129).  The Administration strongly objects to this provision because it would \nconstrain DOD\u2019s  flexibility to adjust its weapons system inventory to meet  NDS imperatives, \nand inhibit its ability to manage its resources  effectively. The Air Force  is focused on \nprototyping new war-winning capabilities to enhance capacity of fires such as palletized \nmunitions, which could offer enhanced capacity of fires without increasing demand for \nadditional  aircraft platforms that are more expensive.  \n \nEnhanced Domestic Content Requirement for Major Defense Acquisition Programs  \n(Section 825).  The Administration strongly objects to section 825 requiring Major  Defense \nAcquisition Programs (MDAPs) to be 100 percent manufactured domestically by the arbitrary \ndeadline of October 1, 2026. The proposal would have a significant and detrimental effect in \nweakening the integrity of our contracting process, driving  increases to acquisition lead times, \nadding  to project  costs, and impacting  delivery of critical MDAP capabilities to the warfighter.    \n \nDocumentation Relating to the F-35 Aircraft Program (Section 131).  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 131, which would limit the ability of the Secretary of Defense to grant  \nMilestone C approval for the F-35 program or enter into full-rate production until 30 days after \nthe Secretary has submitted extensive congressional reporting requirements that go well beyond  \nthe requirements  of 10  U.S.C. 2366c for a Milestone C decision. The reporting requirements are \n \n5  \noverly burdensome and,  in some cases,  would be extremely difficult, if not impossible,  to \nanswer. The requirements  would therefore cause significant delay in achieving a full-rate \nproduction decision and providing critical warfighting capability.  \n \nReprioritization of Military Construction Funding to Unrequested Projects  (Section 4601).  \nThe Administration objects to the bill\u2019s realignment of military  construction funding from  \npriority projects to other projects not included  in  the FY 2021 President\u2019s Budget Request. \nContrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible policy to fully fund projects, the bill \nproposes to fund 12 military construction projects  incrementally, effectively creating an \nunfunded obligation of $600 million needed to fully fund these projects over time. The bill \ndiverts these funds to other unrequested projects.  \n \nPilot Program on Prosecution of Special Victim Offenses Committed by Attendees of  \nMilitary Service Academies (Section 549A). The Administration strongly objects to this \nprovision because it outsources authority for discipline, as well as undermines commander  \naccountability and the chain of command relationship. This provision is inconsistent with many \nprovisions in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, necessitating major  revision of the Rules for \nCourts-Martial, which is not practicable by the provision\u2019s effective date. The likely \nconsequence is that there would be no operable military justice system for sexual assault cases  \nand other covered cases arising from the military service academies  for some period of time. \nAdditionally, section 540F of the FY 2020 NDAA called for a study and report  to assess the \nfeasibility of such a pilot  program, which is due by  October 15, 2020. Legislation directing this \npilot program before the study and report  is completed is premature.    \n \nAuthority of Military Judges and Military Magistrates to Issue Military Court Protective \nOrders (Section 542). The Administration strongly supports providing necessary protections to \nvictims but strongly  objects to section 542 because it would strain the military justice system\u2019s \nlimited resources and greatly expand  the authority of military judges into an area reserved to \ncivil courts. This provision is unnecessary because commanding officers have authority to issue \nmilitary protective orders and service members, dependents, and non-DOD affiliated civilian \nvictims in the United States have  access to State civil courts, which have established \ninfrastructure to receive, consider, and adjudicate  protection order petitions, unlike military \ncourts. If enacted, this provision would likely result in a significant expansion of the military  \njustice system\u2019s caseload, for which the system does not have adequate personnel,  thereby \nproducing undesirable systemic delays, including in sexual assault  cases. Finally, this provision \nwould, in practice, represent a major expansion of the portion of the Gun Control Act of 1968 \ncodified at 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(8).     \n \nBasic Needs Allowance for Low-Income Regular Members (Section 602).  The \nAdministration strongly objects to providing  a basic needs allowance to low-income members \nbecause DOD already provides for the complete food and housing needs  of members.  Military \nmembers are well-compensated, and  more junior enlisted members are  paid between the 95th \nand 99th percentiles relative to their private-sector peers. In addition, the housing allowance, a \nsignificant part of a member\u2019s compensation, is excluded from the basic  needs allowance \neligibility calculation. Instead, the basic needs allowance is based on a member\u2019s household size \nand would require roommates and unrelated individuals in the household to disclose  their  \n \n6  \ndetailed, personal income information to DOD  to calculate  the member\u2019s  allowance. This section \nwould also raise fairness concerns by  excluding  members of the United States Coast  Guard, \nmembers assigned outside the United States, and  members of the Active Guard and Reserve.  \n \nNotice and Comment for Proposed Actions of the Secretary of Defense Relation to Food \nand Beverage Ingredients (Section 1753).  The Administration strongly objects to the \nrequirement to publish a Federal Register notice and provide opportunity for public comment \nbefore  limiting or prohibiting any food or beverage ingredient  in military food service, military  \nmedical foods, or commissary foods. This law would jeopardize the safety of  service  members, \nas it would dangerously delay by months a DOD-wide recall or prohibition of certain ingredients \nthat have been determined by the Food and Drug Administration, the Surgeon General of the \nPublic Health Service, the Surgeons General of the DOD, or other regulatory  or public health  \nauthority to be harmful for human consumption.    \n \nModification to Limitation on  the Realignment or Reduction of Military Medical Manning \nEnd Strength (Section 715). The Administration strongly objects to any prohibition related to \nrealignment or reduction of military  medical end strength until the Secretary of Defense submits \na report to Congress on whether specific conditions and analyses have been completed. \nProhibiting DOD from converting medical end strength to higher priority needs for a year  \nprevents DOD from appropriately shaping the force in a planned, timely way to meet NDS \nrequirements.     \n \nMandatory Criteria for Strategic Basing Decisions (Section 1048). The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 1048 because isolating a limited set of basing factors, reporting pre-\ndecisional basing information, and providing publicly releasable quantitative analysis on \ncommunity support will embolden special interest groups to influence Air Force decisions and \ncircumvent proper application of military judgment to make strategic basing decisions to best  \nsupport the NDS.  \n \nLimitation on Reserve Components of the Air Force (Section 517). The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 517 because it would restrict routine personnel reassignments within  \nthe Air Force Reserve  and Air National Guard as well as strategic basing actions until  certain \nconditions are met. Ultimately, section 517  restricts the ability of the Secretary of the Air Force  \nto manage and posture forces to support the NDS.  \n \nSupport Provided to Other United States Agencies for Counterdrug Activities and \nActivities  to Counter Transnational Organized Crime (Section 1012). The Administration \nobjects to the language in  section 1012 requiring congressional notification 15 days before  \nproviding counterdrug and counter transnational organized crime support to United States  law \nenforcement agencies under 10 U.S.C. 284(b) authority. This requirement would effectively \nterminate the authority delegated to Combatant Commanders to provide short-notice support to \nUnited States  law enforcement agencies, including the fulfillment of short-notice  intelligence \nanalysis requests and transportation requests,  such as the fulfillment of ad hoc translation or \nintelligence analysis requests and short-notice transportation requests for law enforcement \nagency personnel, contraband, or for controlled deliveries.   \n \n \n7  \nNonimmigrant Status for Certain Nationals of Portugal (Section 1755).  The Administration \nobjects to the provision that certain nationals of Portugal, for purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of  \nsection 101(a)(15)(E) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 11101(a)(15)(E)), shall \nbe considered eligible to apply for E treaty trader nonimmigrant visas if the Government of \nPortugal provides similar nonimmigrant status to nationals of the United States. A separate bill, \nH.R.  565,  was passed by the House  and sent to the Senate in December 2019. Adding this \nprovision to the NDAA would  subvert the usual process for addressing E treaty trader \nnonimmigrant visa status. The Administration looks forward to Congress continuing its work on \nH.R. 565 and coming to a final resolution on this issue.  \n \nLimitation on Authority to Exclude Employees from Chapter 71 of Title 5 (Section 1102). \nThe Administration objects to section 1102 because it would constrain the President\u2019s authority \nto protect national security interests through a critical workforce management tool. This \nauthority has allowed Presidents to respond  quickly  to emerging threats and national \nemergencies  since 1978,  and this prohibition is unwarranted.  \n \nLimiting the Number of Local Wage Areas Defined Within a Pay Locality (Section 1106). \nThe Administration strongly objects to section 1106 because it would unnecessarily increase the  \ncosts for Federal agencies to conduct business in certain parts of the country by forcing agencies \nto pay their  employees well above market wage levels. The U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM),  with the advice of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee, the \nnational labor-management committee responsible for advising OPM on the administration of  \nthe Federal Wage System, is in the best position to administer the prevailing rate system in \naccordance with existing laws and administrative procedures,  which fully consider  the views of  \naffected agencies, employees, and the public.  \n \nModification of Requirements Relating to Certain Cooperative Research and Development \nAgreements (Section 213).  The  Administration strongly objects to section 213,  which \nintroduces new and undefined terms and concepts  that  obscure congressional intent,  and, in some \ncases, are detrimental to the DOD\u2019s ability to cooperate with allies and partners in accordance \nwith the NDS. It also adds layers to authorities already possessed under 10 U.S.C. 2350a and 22 \nU.S.C.  section 2767. The existing authorities under 10 U.S.C. 2350a are long-standing and have  \nproven to be fully sufficient and broad at this time, in conjunction with other existing authorities, \nto enable a wide array of cooperative research and development agreements with DOD partners \nglobally.    \n \nPilot Program to Support Combatant Command Military Construction Priorities (Section \n2807).  Although the Administration supports the Committee\u2019s intent to expedite the posture  \npriorities in the Indo-Pacific Command, it objects  to  section 2807, which would establish a pilot \nprogram to reserve 10  percent of all appropriated military construction funds for execution by the \nCombatant Command. The Administration has placed a significant focus on ensuring that  the \nnecessary capabilities are achieved in the United States  Indo-Pacific region,  and a separate \nreserve would divert funding from other priority military construction projects  that are also \nrequired for critical global capabilities.  \n \n \n8  \nHomeland Defense Radar\u2014Hawaii (HDR-H)  (Section 4201).  The Administration strongly \ndisagrees with the authorization of funding for the Homeland Defense Radar  \u2013  Hawaii. The \nAdministration\u2019s highest missile defense priority is to increase the size and reliability of its \ninterceptor fleet as soon as possible. To provide a  more robust defense of the continental United \nStates  and Hawaii, the Department is prioritizing the Next Generation Interceptor and underlay \ndemonstrations.   \n \nModifications to Supervision and Award of Certain Contracts (Section 841). The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 841 because the provision will  increase acquisition \ntime, add to project costs, affect  construction quality, and duplicate existing reporting and \nadvertising requirements  to well-known SBA and Federal systems. It would insert the \ngovernment in prime contractors\u2019 subcontracting arrangements by promoting government-\ndirected subcontractor  arrangements. It  also would limit technical capability at  the subcontractor  \nlevel by creating a regional preference for firms,  potentially affecting  contractor performance by \nexcluding more experienced firms, and could exclude competitive and cost-effective small  \nbusinesses outside those  parameters, extend contract lead times, and increase project costs.  \n \nStandardization of Payment of  Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay for Members of  the Armed  \nForces (Section 613).  The Administration objects to section 613 because it restricts the ability to \nprorate payments of all forms of hazardous duty pay.  Requiring the payment without proration \nwould be a notable departure from the norm and equity of other incentive pay authorities in \nwhich the payment amounts reflect the duration of actual qualifying service.  Without proration, a \nmember who performs a hazardous duty for only part of a month would receive a \u201cwindfall,\u201d  and \nthis devalues the payment for a member who must perform  the hazardous duty for an entire \nmonth.  This provision, with its narrow scope and restrictive provisions, removes the Secretary\u2019s \ndiscretion and flexibility concerning the payment method for hazardous  duty pay.   \n \nChair of  DOD  Explosive Safety Board (Section 361). The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 361, which would adversely impact DOD\u2019s performance of its Acquisition and \nSustainment mission by limiting its ability to execute or obligate more than 75 percent of FY \n2021 funds. This funding is limited until the services and OSD appoint military officers to the \nExplosives Safety Board and its Chair, which eliminates DOD\u2019s ability to appoint  the most \nqualified explosives safety professionals, many of whom  are civilians.    \n \nAnalysis of  Alternatives for Homeland Missile Defense Missions (Section 1656). The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 1656, which would  direct an Analysis of Alternatives  \nfor Homeland Missile Defense. In 2016, Missile Defense Agency  (MDA) analysis showed that  \nregional missile defense systems have the potential to provide ballistic missile defense for \nstrategic attacks against the homeland.   \n \nResponsibility for  the Sector Risk  Management Agency Function of  DOD  (Section 1624).  \nThe Administration strongly objects to this provision\u2019s assignment of responsibilities for the \nDefense Industrial Base  within DOD. This direction would contradict existing policies, blur  \nstatutory authorities, and necessitate a significant recalibration of existing efforts. Further, it \nwould impose substantial unbudgeted costs in an austere fiscal environment,  delay initiatives to \n \n9  \nsecure the Defense Industrial Base,  and limit the management authority and flexibility of the \nSecretary of Defense.  \n \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy (Section 902). The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 902. The provision would constrain the Secretary of Defense\u2019s \ndiscretionary authority to use Assistant Secretary of Defense positions for his highest priorities. \nFurther,  this provision would create a  legal inconsistency by creating an  Assistant Secretary of \nDefense for Industrial Base Policy  with  authority over export control issues, when current law  \nvests that authority with  the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.  \n \nModifications to Implementation Plan for Restructure or Realignment of Military Medical \nTreatment Facilities (Section 716). The Administration strongly objects to the addition of a \nyear-long waiting period  before  executing  the changes to the military medical treatment facilities \nrequired by Congress in the FY 2017 NDAA. A year-long delay will complicate the ability for \nlocal providers to plan for additional staff and any increase in facilities necessary to care for \nadditional DOD  beneficiaries. This will make implementation more difficult to coordinate and is \ncounterproductive to achieving Congress\u2019s  original goals expressed in legislation.  \n \nLimitation  on the Physical Move, Integration, Reassignment, or Shift in Responsibility of \nMarine Forces Northern Command (Section 1050). This provision unduly restricts the \nCommandant\u2019s ability to manage his service by placing artificial barriers to realignment of \ncommands that are intended to provide the following: (1) Better posturing of Marine Corps \norganizations to provide support to Combatant Commanders, in this case of Northern Command, \nby co-locating the service component (Marine Forces North) with the force provider (Marine \nForces Command); and (2) Aligning  the Marine Corps structure to that of the Navy, an objective \noutlined in the Commandant\u2019s Planning Guidance, by locating Marine Forces North and Marine \nForces Command geographically with Fleet Forces Command and Naval  Forces North.  \n \nExtension of Limitation Relating to Classification of High-Level Waste (Section 3113).  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 3113, which impairs DOE\u2019s  ability to manage the \nlifecycle of radioactive waste  under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA). This impairment \ncould limit  DOE\u2019s ability to advance its cleanup mission,  including the cleanup of reprocessing \nwaste, and potentially could increase the costs to complete such efforts,  which is  in conflict with \nDOE fulfilling its mission in a cost-effective manner. This provision could  also cause potential \nlegal conflicts concerning State authority when read alongside AEA provisions that \nunambiguously grant exclusive authority to the Federal Government to store, process, transport, \nand dispose of radioactive waste resulting from weapons production.  \n \nNuclear Warhead Acquisition Processes (Section 3111).  The Administration objects to section \n3111, which would impose overly prescriptive and duplicative requirements on the  DOE/NNSA  \nand DOD\u2019s  joint nuclear  weapons acquisition processes.  The requirements set forth in  section \n3111 are unnecessary because  there  are well-established processes for nuclear weapons  \nacquisition.  The existing Phase X processes and procedures include control points, approvals, \nindependent cost reviews, peer reviews, and reporting requirements.  Section 3111 would add \ndelays and  costs  with little benefit.  \n  \n \n10  \nPlutonium Pit Production (Section 3115).  The Administration objects to  section 3115, which \nadds unnecessary requirements for an independent cost estimate that  assigns  a \u201cconfidence \nlevel.\u201d  DOE Order 413.3B  processes for managing capital asset acquisition already include the \ndevelopment of independent cost estimates at each critical decision milestone,  including \nconfidence levels based on project scale, complexity and scope reasonable at the expected \nmilestone, as well as independent cost estimates when appropriate.  \n \nSmall Business Contracting and Category Management (Section  833).  The Administration is  \nproud of the record-setting level of contract awards that have been made to small business  \ncontractors, and the ability to do so in harmony with the use of category management principles \nthat are helping agencies achieve greater value for the taxpayer and save tens of billions of \ndollars.  The  Administration, however,  objects to constraints in section 833 that could complicate \nhow best to balance the participation of section  8(a)  contractors, women-owned small  businesses, \nservice-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone contractors on local, agency-\nwide, and government-wide contracts.  The Administration recognizes the critical need to \nminimize barriers to entry.  The Frictionless Acquisition Cross Agency Priority Goal reflects our \ncommitment to ensure  that category management practices are used to reduce barriers  to entry \nand increase the level of opportunity available to small business and strengthen small business  \nresiliency in the Federal marketplace.   \n \nForeign Policy and Assistance Related Matters (Sections 1213, 1258-1259, and 1266).  \nSections 1213, 1258, 1259, and 1266, among other provisions, concern  foreign policy and \nforeign assistance priorities, and while they may advance efforts that the Administration \nsupports, the Administration is concerned that these provisions do not have a means to ensure the  \nimplementation of these authorities are consistent with United States foreign policy interests and \nto avoid serious unintended consequences.  \n \nClarifications regarding scope of employment and reemployment rights of members of the \nuniformed services (Section  534). The Administration objects to  the arbitration provision of \nsection 534.  Barring military service discrimination claims from being sent to arbitration in \naccordance with existing agreements would circumvent established contracts and add \nunnecessary legal procedures.  This would not clarify or reinforce the rights of members of the \nuniformed services. Instead,  it would fundamentally alter the process of dispute resolution to an \nunknown end.    \n \nAmendment to definition of qualified apprentice (Section  817).  The Administration objects to \nsection 817 because it would attempt to undercut Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs \nand other private sector-led workforce training models, which support workers in developing \nskills and finding jobs.  Undermining high-quality  and successful apprenticeship programs that \nhave been developed by industry is a move in the wrong direction.  \n \nSpecial  Rules for Certain Monthly Workers\u2019  Compensation Payments and Other Payments \nfor Federal Government Personnel under Chief of Mission  Authority (Section  1110).  The \nDepartment of State is currently authorized to provide additional compensation and medical \nbenefits to its employees who are injured abroad while under the authority of a chief of \nmission.  Section 1110 expands eligibility for these additional benefits to other Federal  \n \n11  \nemployees who likewise are injured under authority of the chief of  mission.  The Administration \nobjects to  the provision because it would create ambiguity in the scope of coverage provided and \nuncertainty regarding the coordination of the expanded benefit and the benefits provided under  \nthe Federal Employees\u2019  Compensation Act (FECA), increasing the risk of improper payments.  \n \nCompetition requirements for purchases from Federal Prison Industries (Section 814).  The \nAdministration supports section 814, which would remove the  five  percent statutory cap on DOD  \nnon-competitive procurements from  Federal Prison Industries (\u201cFPI\u201d).  The cap prohibits FPI \nfrom  exceeding five  percent of the market share of DOD purchases in any  given product \ncategory without competition.   \n \nDevelopment of Hypersonic and Ballistic Missile Tracking Space Sensor Payload (Sections \n1651 and  1653).  The Administration appreciates the intent of section 1653 and agrees with the \nneed to mature space-based sensing capabilities that could provide value for missile defense. The \nAdministration, however,  objects to the requirement that the MDA  be solely responsible for the  \ndevelopment of the hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor payload  because it  would \nfragment space capabilities across multiple agencies.   \n \nModification of Joint AI Research, Development and Transition Activities (Section 217).  \nThe Administration strongly objects to section 217,  which would realign the Joint  Artificial  \nIntelligence Center (JAIC)  to the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DSD). Elevating JAIC  to  report \ndirectly to the DSD would afford the high visibility that DSD direct reports enjoy, as well as high \npriority in the Secretary of Defense\u2019s control of the budget request process  and ability to grant \nwaivers from any bureaucratic process requirements not grounded in law. However, no matter \nwhere you place JAIC in the organization, oversight will need to be delegated to an organization \n(such as  the  DOD Chief Information Officer) that has the competency and expertise to lead and \nintegrate JAIC capabilities into a broader portfolio.  \n \nReport on Risk to National Security Posed by Quantum  Computing Technologies (Section \n1614). The Administration objects to provisions that have already been completed by the \nNational Institute in Standards and Technology in (a)(2)(B) and (C) \u2013  the assessments of \nquantum-resistance cryptographic standards and the feasibility of alternate quantum-resistance \nmodels. Requiring DOD to report on these subjects would create confusion and could undermine \nthese important efforts.  \n \nRenewal of Fallon Range Training Complex Land Withdrawal  and Reservation  (Section \n2842).  The Administration appreciates section 2842, which would extend the current withdrawal \nand reservation of lands  known as the Fallon Range Training Complex (FRTC) to November 6, \n2046. However, the Administration strongly urges Congress to adopt DOD\u2019s request to expand \nthe FRTC to provide the area needed to fully accommodate  modern military training \nrequirements. This requested expansion of the range is essential  to accommodate Naval Aviation \nand Sea, Air and Land (SEAL) training at Naval Air Station Fallon needed to support the \nNational Defense Strategy. The FRTC is currently too small to accommodate realistic training \nwith precision-guided munitions, and is too small for SEAL  ground mobility maneuver training \nin a tactical  and relevant environment.  \n \n \n12  \nRenewal of Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) Withdrawal and Reservation  \n(Section 2843).  The Administration supports renewal of the NTTR, but seeks inclusion of  \nadditional expansion language, as capabilities and technologies have advanced at a rate that \nexceed the existing functional limits and geographic boundaries of the range. The expansion will \ncreate a facility that will allow the Air Force to realistically train with newly procured systems \nand munitions to enable the Air Force to train as it will fight.   \n  \nConstitutional Concerns.  Certain provisions in this bill  raise constitutional concerns. The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns  \nas this legislation advances.  \n \n13 ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nSeptember 21, 2020  \n(House  Rules)  \nS O A P  \nTATEMENT  F  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4447 \u2013  Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act  \n(Rep. O\u2019Halleran, D-AZ,  and 9  cosponsors)  \nThe Administration opposes passage of H.R. 4447. The Administration  supports clean energy, \njob development,  and the innovation economy  and adheres to a bottom-up energy philosophy \nthat  promotes  free-markets, funds  scientific research, and honors  the choices of producers and \nconsumers. This bill, however, would implement a top-down approach that would undermine the \nAdministration\u2019s deregulatory agenda and empower  the government to select favored  solutions \nwhile reinstating big-government policies and programs.  \nH.R. 4447  would lead to higher  energy costs and discourage innovation and entrepreneurship. \nThis legislation would bypass well-established processes and procedures and would impose \nsubstantial, unwarranted costs on Federal, State, and local agencies and other key stakeholders in \nboth public and private sectors.  It would do so by  setting rigid energy savings and water \nconsumption reduction targets for Federal agencies, requiring State and local governments to \nestablish strict building codes that are not grounded in available technologies, and mandating a \nrigorous  transition from hydrofluorocarbon use in the private heating and cooling sector.   \nH.R. 4447  also fails on several other measures.  Its  proposed creation of new workforce  \ndevelopment, training, and other related programs is unnecessary and would lead to greater \nfragmentation of the workforce system and duplication of efforts between Federal agencies. To \nsupport the substantial costs of these programs, the bill would authorize  billions in new annual \nspending.  It  would also create a \u201cgreen bank\u201d that would subsidize projects similar to well-\nknown failures like  Solyndra. It ignores the importance of permitting reform while endorsing \nmore government control and mandates on goods and products  without consideration of the cost  \nto consumers. It would also set up new mandates and regulations that  would undo  the  \nAdministration\u2019s significant progress  in lowering emissions  and  cleaning our air  and water. \nFinally, H.R. 4447 would interfere with how we have been  designing our own energy and \nenvironment destiny free from the reins of the Paris Climate Accord  and international \nagreements or organizations  that  ignore the clear lessons that have led to American energy \nindependence.  \nSince January 2017, the  United States has experienced a remarkable turnaround in its energy \nfortunes. In a few short years, our  Nation has achieved energy independence and become a net  \nenergy exporter and a world energy powerhouse.  We have increased  exports of United States  \nLiquefied Natural Gas (LNG) by nearly five-fold and issued 20 long-term authorizations for \nLNG exports to non-free trade agreement countries.  The United States is  the number one  producer of oil  in the world and has maintained  its status as the top producer of nuclear power  \nand the top producer of natural gas, as well as the world\u2019s second-leading  generator  of wind and \nsolar power.  Crucially, while dominating in energy production, the United States continues to \nlead the world in reducing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Americans now have greater  \naccess to energy that is abundant, affordable, clean, and reliable, and the Administration looks  \nforward to continuing our successful approach to build on these achievements.  \nIf H.R. 4447 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.

Scott, D-VA, and 91 cosponsors) \nThe Administration opposes H.R. 1230, the misleadingly named  Protecting Older Workers \nAgainst Discrimination Act.  The  Administration believes  discrimination is never  acceptable  but \nis concerned with the potential harmful unintended consequences this legislation which would \nundo what works well in current  law.   Instead of protecting older workers, the bill would enrich \ntrial lawyers and make it harder to identify and address genuine discrimination.   \nFirst,  H.R. 1230 reduces the burden of proof for  claims  under the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act,  retaliation  claims under Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act of  1964,  the  \nAmericans  with  Disabilities Act,  and  the  Rehabilitation  Act.  Under current law, plaintiffs in \nthese cases generally  must show that an employer would not have taken an employment action \n\u201cbut for\u201d a protected characteristic.  H.R. 1230 would allow plaintiffs to prevail and obtain \nlimited  forms of  relief  if  the protected  characteristic was  a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the  \nemployment action,  even if  the  employer  can demonstrate they would have taken the action,  for  \nexample, because of poor  performance,  regardless  of  age.   \nSecond, H.R. 1230 would nullify  decades of  judicial precedent  on which courts, employees, and \nemployers have  relied  with few  offsetting  benefits.  In fact,  the  committee hearings revealed  \nthere is little evidence that this change would increase the number of meritorious claims brought. \nReducing the standard of causation from \u201cbut for\u201d to \u201cmotivating factor\u201d would, however, allow  \nmore claims to proceed to  trial.  \u201cMotivating  factor\u201d  liability  may  be imposed when an employer  \nconsidered an impermissible factor, but the employer took the same adverse action it would have \ntaken absent that consideration.  This  change  appears more likely to  open the floodgates to weak  \nor frivolous claims and  makes  it more difficult to  resolve  such claims at an early stage, diverting \nexecutive branch  and  judicial resources  away from addressing actual discrimination.   This would \ncreate additional work and income for trial lawyers but provide  little benefit to discrimination  \nvictims.  \nFinally, H.R. 1230 would make resolving retaliation  claims  more difficult.  As the  Supreme \nCourt has observed, reducing the standard of  causation  in  such cases  would incentivize  \nemployees to file  frivolous claims  to  shield  themselves  from  being removed for valid reasons, \nincluding poor performance.  The current \u201cbut for\u201d standard appropriately allows employees to \ncontest genuine discrimination while screening out frivolous charges.  H.R. 1230 would upset \nthis  balance and  make it much more difficult for  employers to  address  workplace performance. \nIf H.R. 1230 were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisors would \nrecommend that he veto the bill. \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nJune 24, 2019  \n(House  Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3401 - Emergency  Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian Assistance and  \nSecurity at the Southern Border Act, 2019  \n(Rep. Lowey, D-NY)  \nThe Administration  strongly opposes H.R. 3401, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations  \nfor Humanitarian Assistance and Security  at the Southern Border Act, 2019.  After ignoring the  \nAdministration\u2019s request  for desperately needed funding to address the humanitarian crisis at the  \nborder for over  a month, and despite the efforts of  the House minority, the  House  majority  has  \nput forward a partisan bill that underfunds  necessary accounts and  seeks to  take advantage of the \ncurrent crisis  by inserting policy provisions  that would make our country less safe.  \nThe Administration is disappointed that neither the House nor Senate bills  include necessary  \nfunding for  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  detention.  By opposing detention \nbeds\u2014where illegal migrants are placed pending their removal\u2014Democrat lawmakers  are \ndeclaring their belief that illegal immigrants, including those who skip court hearings or commit \nadditional crimes, should be allowed to remain in our country indefinitely.  The ideological  \naversion to our Nation\u2019s  interior immigration enforcement  agency must stop.  We cannot have a \nsovereign nation if we  continue to demean and underfund our enforcement agencies and  \npersonnel.  In addition, H.R. 3401 declines to provide important funding for the equipment and \ncourtroom space  necessary to support the  execution of the President\u2019s Migrant Protection \nProtocols (MPP)  to adjudicate illegal immigrant hearings, and fails to provide  any funding for \nDepartment of  Defense assistance to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) border  \nenforcement  efforts.  \nH.R. 3401 also  contains a number of problematic  policy provisions that would hinder the  \nAdministration\u2019s efforts to enforce our immigration laws and protect children.  Among other  \ntroublesome provisions that undermine child welfare, the bill would block the Administration \nfrom modifying  certain  Health and Human Services (HHS)  directives in order to prevent  \nchildren from being placed in danger in the  future.  Further undermining  child welfare, the bill \nincludes onerous language impeding the  ability of  HHS to develop additional UAC influx  \ncapacity, which  risks requiring children to remain in DHS custody for longer periods of time. \nH.R. 3401 would also  attempt to undermine MPP by requiring the provision of services to \nindividuals in the program who are no longer in the United States, and by  prohibiting its use  \naltogether  for those families processed under  a new and untested migrant processing center  pilot \nprogram established by the bill.  Finally, the bill  would seek to block the  Administration\u2019s  \ncurrent  policy of  foreign aid to Northern Triangle  countries, a necessary tool  for ensuring  \nenhanced control of migration from those countries.  Because this bill does not provide adequate funding to meet the  current crisis, and because it  \ncontains partisan provisions designed to hamstring the Administration\u2019s border enforcement  \nefforts,  the Administration  opposes its passage.  \n \nIf H.R. 3401 were presented to the President  in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he veto it. \n \n* * * * * * *   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nJune 12, 2019 \n(Senate)   \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS.J.

This joint resolution relates to  $750 million in  Foreign Military Sales  \n(FMS) to Bahrain for a weapons  package  that supports  the F-16 Block 70/F-16V Aircraft fleet.   \nThis package is intended for the sovereign defense of Bahrain, which is home to U.S. Naval  \nForces Central Command, the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, the forward-deployed U.S. Marine  \nCentral Command, Combined Maritime Force, and more than 17,000 United States  citizens.  The \nFMS case  at issue will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United \nStates by improving the security of a major non-NATO partner and important security partner in \nthe region.  Among other things, Bahrain supports United States activities and priorities related \nto anti-piracy efforts in the Arabian and Red Seas, and is an important partner in countering  \nIran\u2019s nefarious activities and in countering al-Qa\u2019ida and ISIS throughout the region.

Dingell, D-MI, and  66 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration strongly opposes passage of  H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act of 2019.  This  \nlegislation would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue certain \nregulations regarding perfluoroalkyl  and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).  This bill would \nsupersede existing  statutory requirements  that require EPA, when regulating chemicals in the \nenvironment, to evaluate and weigh the available scientific and technical information about the  \noccurrence of exposures, the health effects of  exposures, the treatment options available, the  \nopportunities for meaningful improvement in public health protection, and the significant  \npotential effects on public safety.  By doing so, the bill would create  considerable litigation risk, \nset problematic and unreasonable rulemaking timelines and precedents, and impose substantial, \nunwarranted costs on Federal, State, and local agencies and other key stakeholders in both the  \npublic and private sectors.   \nThe Administration is aware of the public concern regarding  PFAS  and is committed to  \nresponding to this  important public health issue.  The  EPA, through its PFAS Action Plan, is  \ntaking extensive efforts to help communities address PFAS nationwide.  In this work, the EPA, \nalong with other  Federal agencies, continues to follow the statutorily mandated regulatory  \nprocesses to evaluate  and determine the  appropriate actions needed to protect the  health  of the  \nAmerican people, including actions to protect the  safety of our drinking  water. \nH.R. 535 would require the Administration  to bypass well-established processes, procedures, and \nlegal requirements of the Nation\u2019s most fundamental environmental  laws, including the  \nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Safe Drinking  \nWater Act;  the Toxic Substances Control Act;  the Clean Air Act; and the Solid Waste Disposal \nAct.  These laws establish  valuable processes to ensure public participation and transparency  and \nensure that appropriate, scientifically sound actions  are taken to protect the American people.   \nRather than allow EPA to regulate PFAS in accordance with the carefully  devised processes set  \nforth in these and other laws, the bill would simply  require EPA to put certain regulatory  \nmeasures in place.  \nThe regulatory process works best when EPA and other agencies are free to devise regulations  \nbased on the best available science and careful consideration of all the relevant facts.   By  \ntruncating the rulemaking process, this legislation risks undermining public confidence in the  \nEPA\u2019s decisions, and also risks the imposition of  unnecessary costs on States, public water  \nsystems, and others responsible for complying with its prescriptive mandates.  This bill also  disregards  implementation challenges.   H.R. 535 would impose a heavy burden on \nStates, local  governments, and other potentially responsible parties by placing them in the  \ndifficult position of having to implement stringent regulations before  any consideration of  \nwhether such implementation is  even  feasible.   Given the  lack of  available,  effective,  low-cost  \ntreatment,  disposal, and replacement  options  for PFAS, States,  local governments, public water  \nsystems, and other potentially  responsible parties are likely to encounter barriers to compliance  \nand unintended negative  consequences, such  as  significantly reduced  effectiveness of firefighting  \ncapabilities.  \nAdditionally, sections 6  and  8-12 of H.R. 535 are  duplicative of provisions recently enacted into \nlaw under the  National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.  Enacting  duplicative  \nstatutory requirements such as these, which pertain  to PFAS data calls and  reporting, PFAS \ndestruction and disposal, and cooperative agreements with States,  could generate significant \nconfusion  among stakeholders, and could waste  valuable resources in administering redundant or  \nperhaps even conflicting  provisions.  \nIf H.R. 535  were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto \nthe bill.  \n \n* * * * * * *  \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nOctober 17, 2019 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS.J. Res. 53\u2014Providing for Congressional Disapproval of the Rule Submitted by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency Relating to \"Repeal of the Clean Power Plan\" \n(Sen. Cardin, D-MD) \nThe Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 53.  This resolution would nullify \nAdministration rulemaking and guidance regarding section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). \nThis rulemaking establishes achievable and realistic standards that enable States to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions while providing affordable and reliable energy for all Americans.  \nThis resolution would reinstate the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was premised on a novel and \nexpansive view of the EPA\u2019s statutory authority that was inconsistent with the CAA.  The CPP \nsought to reduce emissions by effectively mandating expensive shifts in the balance of coal-, \ngas-, and renewable-generated power across the Nation\u2019s power grid.  Instead of allowing market \nforces and technology to drive innovation, the CPP picked winners and losers across the energy \nindustry.  After the CPP was issued in October 2015, 150 entities, including 27 States, \nchallenged the rulemaking as being unlawful, and in 2016, the Supreme Court issued a stay of \nthe rule that blocked it from taking effect. \nBy contrast, the Trump Administration\u2019s Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule adheres to the \nCAA, provides States with new emission guidelines, and empowers States to choose the path to \nemissions reductions that is appropriate for their unique energy portfolio.  The ACE rule also \nidentifies efficiency improvements that can help existing coal-fired electric utility generating \nunits meet and achieve realistic greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  It will help ensure that the \nAmerican public will have access to affordable and reliable energy. \nBy seeking to repeal a reasonable regulation and restore an overreaching, unlawful rule, S.J.

Lowey, D-NY) \nThe Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 2740, as amended by the House Committee \non Rules, making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, and related agencies, for the Department of Defense, for the Department of State, \nforeign operations, and related programs, and for energy and water development and related \nagencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2020 and for other purposes.  The \nAdministration is strongly opposed to the budgetary framework that underlies this and other \nappropriations bills being considered by the House of Representatives.  This framework would \nraise the discretionary spending caps by more than $350 billion in fiscal years (FY) 2020 and \n2021 and does not reflect either a House-passed budget resolution or a bipartisan, bicameral \nagreement.  It would put the Federal Government on track to add nearly $2 trillion to deficits \nover 10 years, adding significantly to the national debt, which is already more than $22 trillion \nand rising.   \nIn addition, the House Democrats\u2019 framework continues to adhere to the misguided and \nunfounded notion that increases to defense spending must be matched or exceeded by increases \nto non-defense spending.  In fact, the appropriations bills under consideration would provide \nmore than twice as much additional funding in FY 2020 for non-defense programs as for defense \nprograms, relative to FY 2019 levels.  Investing in our national security remains a key \nAdministration priority, but strengthening our defense does not require additional non-defense \ndiscretionary spending.  \nOverall, according to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 2740 would spend $984.7 billion\u2014 \n$63.4 billion, or 6.9 percent, above the FY 2020 Budget request and $31.5 billion above the \nFY 2019 enacted level.  In addition, this legislation includes a number of particularly \nproblematic provisions implicating key Administration priorities, including provisions that \nwould block implementation of new Title X and conscience protection rules at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, as well as restrict implementation of the Protecting Life in Global \nHealth Assistance policy.  The bill also includes problematic language that would prohibit the \ntransfer and execution of funds to improve our Nation\u2019s border security, and that would \notherwise impede immigration enforcement. \nIf H.R. 2740 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he veto it.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nHouse Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill. \nDivision A\u2014Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020 \nDepartment of Labor \nApprenticeship. The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for the expansion of \napprenticeship model, but opposes its restriction that the funding only be spent on registered \napprenticeships.  This restriction limits the Department\u2019s ability to engage employers in adopting \nthe apprenticeship model, particularly employers in industries in which apprenticeships are not \nalready common.  \nProtecting Union Members. The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s underfunding of \nthe Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS).  The increase requested in the FY 2020 \nBudget is necessary to restore OLMS\u2019s investigative workforce and strengthen protections for \ntransparency for union members by supporting more audits and investigations to uncover flawed \nofficer elections, fraud, and embezzlement. \nJob Corps. The bill provides $1.9 billion for Job Corps, ensuring excessive funds would \ncontinue to be spent on low-performing centers that are failing students.  The Administration \ncontinues to strongly support reforms to create a program to better prepare youth for jobs and \nkeep them safe while doing so. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) \nUnaccompanied Alien Children (UAC). While the Administration appreciates the funding that \nthe bill provides for the UAC program, the level provided in the bill would be insufficient to \nmeet current program needs, which are at crisis levels, as acknowledged in the recent \nhumanitarian supplemental request.  The Administration urges the Congress to include the \n$2 billion mandatory contingency fund proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request, which is the \nmost effective way to manage the inherent uncertainty in this program.  The Administration also \nopposes the numerous provisions that might impede HHS\u2019s ability to effectively operate the \nUAC program and to protect the safety of children in HHS\u2019s care, and provisions that would \ncreate additional barriers preventing the Government from enforcing the Nation\u2019s immigration \nlaws. \nOpioids. The Administration appreciates that the bill includes funding to fight the opioids \nepidemic, most notably the $1.5 billion provided for State grants to address opioid abuse \nincluding prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. \nEnding HIV Epidemic Initiative. The Administration appreciates that the bill includes funding \nfor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to undertake this priority initiative. \n2  NIH.  The Administration supports the inclusion of funding for high priority research areas \nidentified in the FY 2020 Budget request, such as the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative.  \nHowever, the bill also includes funding for NIH in excess of $7 billion above the FY 2020 \nBudget request.  The Administration supports strategic funding to accelerate the development of \ntreatments and strongly opposes across-the-board increases to the NIH topline that are \nunsustainable and redirect resources from the highest priority research.  In addition, the \nAdministration is disappointed that the bill does not consolidate the Agency for Healthcare \nResearch and Quality activities in NIH, as requested in the FY 2020 Budget.  The Administration \nstrongly supports better coordination of health services research and the elimination of funding \nfor potentially duplicative or lower priority activities. \nTitle X Family Planning. The Administration opposes language that would prevent \nimplementation of the new rule that would ensure compliance with statutory Title X program \nintegrity provisions among HHS programs, in particular the prohibition on funding of programs \nwherein abortion is a method of family planning.  The new rule makes notable improvements \ndesigned to increase the number of patients served and to improve the quality of care they \nreceive.  In addition, the bill includes $114 million more than the FY 2020 Budget request for \nTitle X Family Planning.  The Administration is also disappointed that the bill does not contain \nlanguage requested in the FY 2020 Budget that would prohibit Federal funding from being \nprovided to certain providers of abortion services. \nCDC, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  The Administration is \ndisappointed that the bill provides unrequested funding for NIOSH activities, which is \ncontributing to the overall excessive spending in the bill.  The bill provides $346 million, which \nis $156 million more than requested in the FY 2020 Budget. \nTeen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program. The Administration opposes the bill\u2019s inclusion of \n$110 million in unrequested funds for the TPP program.  The bill also requires that the \nAdministration continue to fund through 2020 grants awarded for FYs 2015 through 2019. The \nTPP program began in FY 2010 to provide competitive grants to replicate successful TPP \napproaches, test new TPP approaches, and identify the effectiveness of these interventions.  The \nTPP program serves less than one percent of teenagers in the United States.  Although the \nteenage pregnancy rate has declined significantly, the evidence suggests that TPP has not been a \nmajor driver in that reduction. \nConscience Protection Rule Implementation Prohibition.  The Administration strongly objects to \nthe inclusion of section 240 of the bill, which prohibits the HHS Office for Civil Rights from \nusing appropriated funds to finalize, implement, or enforce the newly published conscience \nprotection final rule.  This rule protects conscience rights for healthcare entities and \nprofessionals. \nReassignment of Medicaid Provider Claims.  The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s \nprohibition on the use of funds to implement the final rule to Protect Medicaid Provider \nPayments.  This rule ensures that any diversions of Medicaid providers\u2019 payments are consistent \nwith statute. \n3  Medicaid Nonemergency Medical Transportation (NEMT). The Administration objects to the \nbill\u2019s prohibition on the use of funds to publish the forthcoming Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services rule to provide States with greater flexibility regarding the provision of \nNEMT for Medicaid beneficiaries. \nFirearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research. The Administration is concerned that the \nbill requires the CDC and NIH to fund research on firearm injury and mortality prevention. \nIndirect Costs. The Administration objects to the inclusion of section 224, which prohibits \nchanges to the method that NIH uses to pay grantee institutions for facilities and administrative \ncosts. The section also prohibits other Federal departments and agencies from developing or \nimplementing modified indirect cost policies, which inhibits agency staff and stakeholders from \ndeveloping strategies to maximize the effectiveness of Federal Government programs and reduce \nburden.  \nSyringe Services General Provision. The Administration notes that the bill does not continue the \ngeneral provision in current law allowing the use of Federal funds to support elements of \nevidence-based syringe services programs, as requested in the FY 2020 Budget.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that these important \nservices can continue to protect Americans from the infectious disease consequences of opioid \nand other drug use, improve rates of addiction treatment and recovery services, and improve \npublic health, consistent with current law. \nDepartment of Education \nUnnecessary Department of Education Programs. The Administration is concerned that the bill \nfunds 29 programs that the Administration has proposed for elimination in the FY 2020 Budget \nrequest.  Eliminating these programs, which are either duplicative, narrowly focused, or unable \nto demonstrate effectiveness, would save $6.7 billion in FY 2020. \nCharter Schools. The Administration is concerned that the bill reduces funding for charter \nschools by $40 million below the FY 2019 enacted level.  The $500 million requested in the \nFY 2020 Budget for charter schools is critical to the Administration\u2019s efforts to provide more \nfamilies with high-quality educational options.  In addition, the bill does not provide the \nDepartment of Education with the flexibility needed to efficiently allocate funding to charter \nschool programs based on applicant demand.  \nExpansion of Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Administration opposes the wasteful \n$350 million funding level provided in the bill for a temporary benefit in the Federal Direct \nStudent Loan program that expands Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility.  The \nAdministration\u2019s FY 2020 Budget request proposes to eliminate the PSLF program, which \nunfairly favors certain career choices over others, and instead focuses assistance on \nundergraduate student borrowers from all professions through a single income-based repayment \nplan. \nOther Independent Agencies \n4  Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS). The Administration opposes the \n$1.1 billion funding level for CNCS.  This funding is unnecessary and wasteful, as the \nCorporation\u2019s mission is not a core Government function.  \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).  The Administration proposes to eliminate Federal \nfunding for CPB in the FY 2020 Budget request and opposes the $495 million funding level for \nFY 2022 provided for CPB through the two-year advance appropriation.  CPB grants represent a \nsmall share of the total funding for the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio \nand the Administration believes private donations would be sufficient to fund these operations. \nDivision B\u2014Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2020 \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) \nDefense Base and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Funding.  The Administration \nstrongly objects to the allocation in the bill between base defense funding and OCO funding.  As \noutlined in the FY 2020 Budget request, the Administration prefers to limit base national defense \nfunding to the current law discretionary cap, while using both OCO and emergency funding to \nprovide the necessary resources to support the National Defense Strategy (NDS).  This approach \nis vital to ensure that necessary funding to defend the Nation is not dependent on another budget \nagreement or legislation increasing the base budget defense cap in current law. \nTransfer Authority. The Administration strongly objects to language in sections 8005 and 9002 \nof the bill that would significantly decrease DOD\u2019s general and special transfer authorities. \nSpecifically, section 8005 of the bill would limit DOD\u2019s base budget general transfer authority to \n$1 billion in FY 2020, $4 billion below the FY 2020 Budget request.  Section 9002 of the bill \nwould limit OCO special transfer authority to $0.5 billion in FY 2020, $4 billion below the \nFY 2020 Budget request.  Limiting DOD\u2019s transfer authorities would severely constrain the \nDepartment\u2019s ability to shift funds between accounts to meet unforeseen or emerging military \nrequirements.  \nBorder Funding. The Administration strongly objects to language in section 8127 of the bill that \nwould prohibit the use of FY 2020 or prior-year defense appropriations to construct barriers or \nsecurity infrastructure along the southern border.  The Administration also objects to restrictions \nincluded in the bill that would prohibit DOD from augmenting counter-drug appropriations using \ntransfer authority, or using counter-drug appropriations for the construction of fences under \nsection 284 of Title 10, United States Code.  The use of prior-year appropriations and transfer \nauthority are critical to assist Department of Homeland Security (DHS) efforts to secure and \nmanage the southern border.  Physical barriers impede the flow of illegal crossings, drugs, and \nother contraband, and therefore make DHS efforts at the border more effective. \nSpace Force.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s recognition that space \ncapabilities are an integral part of the Nation\u2019s security and economy, the bill only provides \n$15 million to study the establishment of the United States Space Force, which is $57 million \nbelow the FY 2020 Budget request.  Over the last 20 years, various commissions authorized by \n5  the Congress and the Government Accountability Office have studied DOD\u2019s current \norganizational structure and have reached the same conclusion\u2014DOD is not properly structured \nfor the challenges the Nation faces in space.  We look forward to working with the Congress to \nauthorize and fully fund the Space Force.  Insufficient resources could delay its establishment, \nputting at risk the Nation\u2019s ability to adapt to the rapidly changing warfighting domain of space.  \nRepublic of Turkey. Section 8111 of the bill would prohibit the use of any funds to deliver F-35 \naircraft or related equipment to the Republic of Turkey.  The Administration shares the concerns \nreflected in the bill regarding the transfer of F-35s should Turkey purchase the S-400, which is \nincompatible with its continued participation in the F-35 program.  However, section 8111 of the \nbill is unacceptable as currently written as it could prohibit delivery of F-35s even if Turkey \nforegoes the S-400 system.  The Administration supports ongoing discussions between the \nUnited States and Turkey and seeks to retain Turkey in the F-35 program, as long as Turkey \ndeclines the S-400 system.  \nRemoval of United States Armed Forces from Yemen.  The Administration strongly objects to the \nlanguage in section 10002 of the bill that would require the removal of United States Armed \nForces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen, except for operations directed at al \nQaeda or associated forces.  Removal of United States Armed Forces would harm bilateral \nrelationships in the region, negatively affect the military\u2019s ability to prevent the spread of violent \nextremist organizations, and would establish a bad precedent for future legislation by defining \n\u201chostilities\u201d to include defense cooperation activities such as aerial refueling.  In addition, the \nAdministration\u2019s continued cooperation with regional partner nations allows the United States to \nsupport diplomatic negotiations to end the conflict, promote humanitarian access, mitigate \ncivilian casualties, and defeat terrorists who seek to harm the United States. \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Administration strongly objects to section \n9025 of the bill, which would repeal the current AUMF.  The 2001 and 2002 AUMFs grant the \nUnited States the legal authority to fight the counter-terrorism campaign against the Taliban, al \nQaeda, and associated forces, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.  While DOD is not \nseeking a new or revised AUMF, the Department continues to participate in productive \ndiscussions with the Congress on the 2001 AUMF.  Arbitrarily repealing the 2001 AUMF would \nrisk the military\u2019s ability to pursue and defeat terrorists who seek to harm the United States and \nthe Nation\u2019s interests at home and abroad.  \nGround Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The Administration strongly objects to the \n$108 million reduction in funding in the bill for the GBSD, the Minuteman III/Intercontinental \nBallistic Missile (ICBM) replacement. Failure to provide the full funding requested in the \nFY 2020 Budget would lead to delays in planned contract awards, increase the risk of not \nmeeting the Combatant Commander\u2019s timelines, and hinder the Department\u2019s effort to replace \nthe aging ICBM fleet. \nIntermediate Range Cruise Missile Capability. The Administration strongly objects to the \nelimination of research and development funding in the bill for Intermediate Range Cruise \nMissile capability. This elimination would disadvantage the United States in the event that \nRussia does not return to compliance with its obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear \n6  Forces Treaty (INF) by the August 2, 2019 deadline endorsed by the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization.  The reduction would leave the United States unprepared to respond to the post-\nINF military environment that will have been created by Russia. \nNext Generation Air Dominance (NGAD).  The Administration strongly objects to the \n$500 million reduction in funding in the bill for the NGAD program.  This 50 percent funding \nreduction from the FY 2020 Budget request would have a severe impact on the ability of the \nprogram to field NGAD capabilities that will be needed in the 2030 timeframe to meet the \ngrowing challenges of peer adversaries.  Full funding of NGAD is also critical for maintaining a \nstrong United States industrial base capable of building the world\u2019s most advanced aircraft.  \nResearch, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E). The Administration objects to the \nreduced funding in the bill for RDT&E.  The bill provides $101 billion for RDT&E\u2014$3 billion \nbelow the FY 2020 Budget request.  Underfunding RDT&E would constrain DOD\u2019s ability to \nmake key investments in research, engineering, and prototyping to maintain the military\u2019s \ntechnological superiority. \nUnmanned Surface Vessels.  While the Administration applauds the Committee\u2019s recognition \nthat Large Unmanned Surface Vessels will provide a more distributed, lethal, and survivable \nnavy, the bill only provides $307 million for these systems, $200 million below the FY 2020 \nBudget request.  These are critical experimentation vessels with modular payloads to reduce risk, \nconduct integration and testing of payloads, and develop Navy tactics and concepts of \noperations.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully support this critical capability at the \nlevels in the FY 2020 Budget request. \nNext Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR).  The Administration strongly \nobjects to the $202 million reduction, and the obligation and expenditure limitation, in the bill \nthat would reduce and withhold funding for Next-Gen OPIR.  The levels proposed in the \nFY 2020 Budget request are essential to hire personnel for design work and to purchase materials \nto meet the Department\u2019s fielding timeline.  Strategic missile warning is a \u201cno-fail\u201d mission and \nwithout full funding, the program would be delayed by a minimum of one year.  \nMultiple Munitions Reductions.  The Administration objects to the $562 million reduction in the \nbill for critical warfighter munitions, which would further reduce key weapons stores.  The \nFY 2020 Budget request increases procurement of preferred and advanced munitions to build \nwar reserves and successfully execute the NDS.  Stable and consistent annual procurements are \nvital to increasing DOD\u2019s lethality and warfighting capability. \nUnobligated Balance Reductions. The Administration objects to the $1.6 billion in reductions \nacross Military Personnel and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) accounts.  These reductions \nfail to account for actions already taken by the Armed Forces to reduce these balances.  If \nenacted, the reductions to the Military Personnel accounts would be applied to military pay and \nallowance programs and would directly affect the Department\u2019s ability to fund full-spectrum \nreadiness recovery efforts, including the Services\u2019 planned growth in forces.  For O&M \naccounts, these reductions would negate the Committee\u2019s otherwise clear intent to support \ndefense readiness, and would directly and negatively impact key readiness priorities including \n7  depot maintenance, base operations support, communications, and facilities sustainment, \nrestoration, and modernization. \nDivision C\u2014Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs \nAppropriations Act, 2020 \nDepartment of State and Other International Programs \nInternational Affairs Topline. The Administration opposes the bill topline level, which far \nexceeds the amount requested in the FY 2020 Budget request.  This is counter to Administration \nefforts to rein in non-defense discretionary funding and eliminate the use of OCO funding for \nFunction 150 programs.  For example, the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development funding level is $12.4 billion, or 31 percent, above the FY 2020 \nBudget request. \nU.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC).  The Administration appreciates the funding \nprovided for DFC administrative expenses, but is concerned that the bill significantly underfunds \nthe new Agency\u2019s programs.  In particular, the bill provides $50 million for the DFC\u2019s new \nequity program, $100 million, or 67 percent, below the FY 2020 Budget request.  This level \nundermines an Administration and congressional priority to provide the DFC with a tool that \nwould catalyze additional investment for development and national security objectives by \nmobilizing the private sector. \nMiddle East Assistance. The Administration appreciates that the bill supports funding for key \npartners in the Middle East, including $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Israel in \nsupport of the 10-year Memorandum of Understanding, bilateral assistance to Jordan in support \nof the strong, strategic United States-Jordan relationship, and security and economic assistance to \nother key partners, including Egypt. \nEconomic and Development Assistance. The Administration opposes the high level of spending \nprovided in the bill for economic and development assistance.  The funding in the bill exceeds \nwhat is needed to support United States national security, promote United States prosperity and \neconomic opportunities, and advance American interests and values around the world.  The bill \nalso does not consolidate this funding into one Economic Support and Development Fund \nappropriation, as was proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request, maintaining unnecessary \naccounts with specialized objectives and limiting flexibility. \nInternational Organizations Contributions. The Administration opposes the significant increases \nfor assessed and voluntary contributions to international organizations, including increased \nfunding for the International Organizations and Programs account, which the FY 2020 Budget \nrequest proposed to eliminate.  The funding provided in the bill is counter to the goals of the \nFY 2020 Budget request, which fully funds international organizations that are critical to \nnational security, while also signaling America\u2019s commitment to greater accountability and \ntransparency and more equitable cost-sharing among members.  In addition, the Administration \nis concerned that the bill would waive the 25 percent statutory cap on United States \npeacekeeping assessments for prior years, and require use of taxpayer funds to pay assessments \n8  in excess of the statutory cap despite the failure of the United Nations to act on United States \ncost sharing proposals. \nGlobal Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund).  The Administration is \ndisappointed that the bill misses an opportunity to seek improved international burden sharing in \nsupport of the Global Fund.  The bill provides more than $600 million above the FY 2020 \nBudget request.  While the Administration supports the work of the Global Fund, the proposal in \nthe FY 2020 Budget request would challenge other donors to do more, and use prior year funds \nthat other donors have not matched, rather than increasing United States funding unilaterally.  \nThe bill instead would undermine the previous matching pledge and require the United States to \nplay a larger role, even while the combination of United States bilateral and multilateral efforts \nalready represent well above half of global funding to combat AIDS. \nProgram Eliminations and Reductions. The Administration is concerned that the bill increases \nor maintains funding that the Administration proposed to eliminate or substantially reduce in the \nFY 2020 Budget request.  This includes:  Educational and Cultural Exchanges; the African \nDevelopment Foundation; the Inter-American Foundation; the Asia Foundation; the East-West \nCenter; the International Fund for Agricultural Development; the U.S. Agency for Global Media; \nthe U.S. Institute of Peace; and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. \nMexico City Policy, Other Abortion Restrictions, and Family Planning. The Administration \nstrongly opposes sections 7058(a) and 7064 of the bill that would effectively block the \nAdministration\u2019s implementation of the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy, \nwhich prohibits the funding of foreign non-governmental organizations that promote or perform \nabortions. The Administration is also concerned that the bill restores unrequested funding for the \nUnited Nations Population Fund, an organization determined by the Secretary of State to support \nor participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. \nReduced Flexibility. The Administration strongly opposes provisions that would significantly \nreduce the Administration\u2019s flexibility to allocate funds to achieve foreign policy objectives. \nSection 7019 of the bill again requires that allocations for assistance accounts conform to \nnumerous detailed congressional funding directives. However, this section goes significantly \nbeyond restrictions in prior acts which have allowed the Administration to respond to changing \nconditions and apply exceptions on a case-by-case basis for urgent or unforeseen needs by both \nlowering the threshold for authorized deviations and\u2014crucially\u2014not allowing for exceptions \npreviously permitted.  In addition, the Administration opposes the revision of section 7011, \nwhich by limiting the amount of time funds are available for reprogramming, would significantly \nhamper the Administration\u2019s ability to ensure that tax payer resources are being used most \neffectively to support programmatic needs in response to evolving circumstances on the ground \nand foreign policy priorities. \nParis Agreement. The Administration strongly opposes section 7060 of the bill, which prevents \nfunding from being used to notify withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.  The provision is \ninconsistent with the President\u2019s announced intentions.  \nVenezuela Transition. The Administration is concerned that the bill fails to provide requested \n9  authority to flexibly respond to the crisis in Venezuela.  Special transfer authority would enable \nthe United States to initiate additional programming quickly to support a democratic transition \nand related needs.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide such authority in a final \nbill to support the people of Venezuela in their fight against tyranny. \nForeign Military Financing (FMF) Loan Authority. The Administration is disappointed that the \nbill fails to include authority requested to provide FMF loans and guarantees, which the \nAdministration views as an important tool for making United States defense equipment a more \ncompetitive and affordable option for partner countries. \nOverseas Humanitarian Assistance Reorganization. The Administration is concerned that the \nbill excludes provisions proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request that would strengthen and \nimprove outdated and fragmented overseas humanitarian assistance, including a new \nInternational Humanitarian Assistance account where spending could adjust flexibly to meet the \nneeds of affected populations as crises drive populations back and forth across borders and \nwithin their own countries.  In addition, section 7006 of the bill retains language enacted in the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 that limits improvements to the United States \nhumanitarian structure by unnecessarily micromanaging how bureaus are managed and funds are \nadministered.  The Administration believes that a stronger and seamlessly coherent Federal \nGovernment structure that elevates humanitarian assistance is needed to resolve conflicts \nunderlying the largest crises while optimizing the outcomes for both beneficiaries and American \ntaxpayers. \nSecretary of State Travel Restriction. The Administration is concerned that the bill seeks to limit \nthe Secretary of State\u2019s travel expenses unless certain timelines are met for submission of the \nDepartment\u2019s congressional budget justification materials and allocations of appropriated \nresources.  Such action could adversely affect the ability of the Secretary to support United \nStates national security objectives, and therefore should be deleted. \nCentral America Strategy. The Administration is concerned that sections 7045(a)(l)(A) and \n7045(a)(l)(B) of the bill retroactively amend and make more restrictive language providing \nfunding in support of the Central America Strategy.  Such language would restrict the flexibility \navailable to the President and Secretary of State to allocate foreign assistance funding in support \nof United States foreign policy objectives and further complicates compliance with numerous \nother congressional directives. \nSaudi Arabia. The Administration opposes section 704l(i) of the bill, which purports to impose \nrestrictions on funding related to how the Administration should approach civil nuclear \ncooperation with Saudi Arabia.  The Administration opposes language that would in any way \naim to restrict flexibility available to the Secretary of State pursuant to authorities under the \nAtomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended).  The language also weakens the Administration\u2019s \nability to support the United States civil nuclear industry\u2019s pursuit of commercial opportunities \ninternationally, at a time when the entire Federal Government should be instead redoubling \nefforts to counter Russian and Chinese influence in the civil nuclear market worldwide. \n10  Division D\u2014Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n2020 \nCorps of Engineers \nInfrastructure. The bill fails to extend section 1043 of the Water Resources Reform and \nDevelopment Act of 2014, as amended, which authorizes non-Federal implementation of \nconstruction of Federal projects, an important tool for reforming and improving investment in \nwater resources. \nTransparency. The Administration is disappointed that the bill fails to revise appropriations \nlanguage in five accounts as proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request to enable greater \ntransparency in how funds are spent.  Establishing separate appropriations accounts for the \nnavigation trust funds would improve accountability, ensure appropriations are used in a manner \nconsistent with statutory requirements, and increase transparency for the public, including the \nusers that pay fees to finance some of these costs.  \nSouthern Border Wall Construction. The Administration objects to the inclusion of section 108 \nin the bill which would preclude the use of funds provided by the bill, or any prior Act, for the \nCivil Works program, for use on the design or construction of any border security infrastructure \nalong the southern border. \nDepartment of Energy \nPlutonium Sustainment. The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s reduction of $220 \nmillion from the FY 2020 Budget request for Plutonium Sustainment within the National \nNuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The requested level is necessary to meet the DOD \nrequirement to produce no fewer than 80 pits per year by 2030.  This 32 percent reduction would \nsignificantly delay the NNSA\u2019s efforts to improve safety and security features while modernizing \nthe stockpile.  In addition, delaying the program would force NNSA to further increase future pit \nproduction capacity to address plutonium aging, thereby requiring a larger and more costly pit \nmanufacturing capability. \nW87-1 Modification Program. The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s reduction of \n$59 million from the FY 2020 Budget request for the W87-1 Modification Program. The W87-1 \nwould provide enhanced safety and security compared to the legacy W78 that it is replacing. \nThe 53 percent funding reduction would delay the program, increase its cost, and force it out of \nalignment with DOD\u2019s plans to deploy the next generation intercontinental ballistic missile, \nthereby adding risks and costs to maintain and qualify the existing warhead. \nNuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response (NCTIR).  The Administration objects to the \nbill\u2019s reduction of $32 million from the FY 2020 Budget request for the NCTIR program.  This \nreduction would compromise DOE ability to execute an interagency effort to speed life-saving \nresponses in the event of a nuclear incident in the United States. Under the Capability Forward \nmodel, DOE would provide enhanced training and equipment to regional Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation (FBI) teams, enabling them to render safe a nuclear device.  Given the \n11  interdependence of DOE and FBI in executing the Capability Forward initiative, if the agencies\u2019 \nbudgets do not remain synchronized, the timeline for fielding enhanced capabilities to United \nStates cities would be severely disrupted.  \nNonproliferation Fuels Development. The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s inclusion of \nfunding for development of high-density, low-enriched fuels that could replace highly enriched \nuranium for naval applications.  In 2018, the Secretaries of Energy and the Navy jointly \ndetermined that the United States should not pursue research and development of an advanced \nnaval nuclear fuel system based on low-enriched uranium since such a system would result in a \nreactor design that is inherently less capable, more expensive, and unlikely to support the \nsignificant cost savings associated with life-of-ship submarine reactors. To fully execute a \ndevelopment effort of this magnitude would also incur significant risk and compete for resources \nagainst other defense priorities. \nApplied Energy Programs. The Administration believes the bill provides excessive funding for \nDOE\u2019s applied energy programs.  The bill provides $5 billion for these programs, $3 billion \nmore than the FY 2020 Budget request.  The Administration urges the Congress to restrain \nfunding levels in these programs and focus resources on early-stage research and development \n(R&D) across the applied energy technology spectrum rather than late-stage or near-commercial \nready technology.  \nLoan Programs. The Administration is disappointed that the bill maintains the Title XVII \nInnovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology Vehicle \nManufacturing Loan Program, and the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program.  The FY 2020 \nBudget request proposed to eliminate these programs and fund only the minimum administrative \nexpenses necessary to monitor the existing portfolio.  The Administration urges the Congress to \nadopt the elimination proposal in order to recognize the private sector\u2019s primary role in taking \nrisks to finance projects in the energy and automobile manufacturing sectors.  \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E). The Administration believes that the \ncontinued funding of ARPA-E makes little strategic sense given the existence of applied energy \nresearch elsewhere within the Department.  The Administration urges the Congress to eliminate \nARPA-E and incorporate its more successful elements, such as coordination with industry and \ncross-cutting research, into the Department\u2019s applied energy programs. \nPetroleum Reserve Sales.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill fails to include \nlanguage implementing the liquidation and sale of the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve and \nNortheast Gasoline Supply Reserve.  Both of these reserves are costly to maintain, operationally \ninefficient, and have never been used for their intended purpose.  \nEnvironmental Management. The Administration opposes the $706 million increase, \n$487 million of which is defense funding, for the Environmental Management program.  The bill \nallocates more than half of this increase to the Hanford site in Washington State, where the \nDepartment\u2019s Inspector General recently compiled concerns regarding mismanagement, weak \ninternal controls, and fraud.  The Administration urges the Congress to reallocate these funds to \nhigher national security priorities. \n12  Office of Science.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for basic R&D in the \nOffice of Science.  However, the bill provides $6.9 billion, $1.4 billion more than the FY 2020 \nBudget request.  The Administration urges the Congress to use restraint in funding these \nprograms.  \nVersatile Advanced Test Reactor.  The Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s support for \nthe Versatile Advanced Test Reactor.  However, the Administration believes that the bill is \nsubstantially underinvesting in this priority. While the Administration agrees that the most cost-\neffective approach should be used and mechanisms such as international cost-sharing should be \nconsidered, the insufficient funding provided in the bill would contribute to problematic delays \nand negative impacts on the project\u2019s ability to achieve its strategic goals. \nDepartment of the Interior \nBureau of Reclamation.  The bill provides $1.6 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and the \nCentral Utah Project (CUP), $528 million or 50 percent above the FY 2020 Budget request.  The \nAdministration appreciates the bill\u2019s investment in water resources through the Bureau of \nReclamation and CUP, but believes funding should be limited to the amount in the FY 2020 \nBudget request and should be focused on the highest priority needs from a national perspective.  \nConstitutional Concerns \nCertain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, certain sections would \ninterfere with the President\u2019s authority as Commander in Chief.  Certain other provisions would \ncontravene the constitutional separation of powers between the Executive Branch and the \nCongress.  In particular, these provisions would require congressional committee approval of \ncertain Executive actions, in violation of INS v. Chadha. The Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress to address these concerns. \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2020 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n* * * * * * * \n13  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nNovember 14, 2019 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4863 \u2013 United States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019 \n(Rep.

Res. 1 \u2014 Making Further Continuing Appropriations for the Department of \nHomeland Security for Fiscal Year 2019 \n(Rep. Lowey, D-NY) \nThe Administration opposes passage of H.R. 21, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, \nproviding appropriations for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2019, for the \nDepartments of Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Justice, \nInterior, State, Transportation, Treasury, and for other purposes.  The Administration also \nopposes passage of H.J. Res. 1, providing appropriations for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (DHS) through February 8, 2019, and for other purposes.  The Administration is \ncommitted to working with the Congress to reopen lapsed agencies, but cannot accept legislation \nthat provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nation\u2019s urgent \nborder security needs. \nIn recent months, the number of people attempting to cross the border illegally has risen to 2,000 \nper day.  Based on 2017 data, an average of more than 300 Americans a week were killed in \nheroin-involved overdoses\u2014and Mexico is the source of nearly 90 percent of wholesale heroin \nseized by law enforcement in the United States.  In FYs 2017 and 2018, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement arrested close to 211,000 aliens convicted of criminal offenses and an \nadditional 55,000 aliens charged with criminal offenses.   \nThe first duty of the Federal Government is to defend the Nation and its citizens, which is why \nPresident Donald J. Trump has made addressing illegal immigration one of his top priorities \nsince taking office.  Specifically, the Administration has repeatedly encouraged the Congress to \nprovide resources needed for DHS to secure the border.  For FY 2019, the Administration has \nmade it clear that the Government needs an investment of at least $5 billion for border security, \nalong with the flexibility necessary to utilize these funds efficiently.  The appropriations bill, \nH.R. 21, and the corresponding H.J. Res. 1, does not come close to providing these necessary \ninvestments and authorities. \nDespite not meeting the minimum requirements identified by those who are directly responsible \nfor the Nation\u2019s border security, this package funds a number of unnecessary programs at \nexcessive levels well beyond what was put forward in the FY 2019 Budget.  The six bills \nprovided for under H.R. 21 provide funding at levels nearly 20 percent higher than the \nPresident\u2019s FY 2019 Budget.  For instance, H.R. 21 provides $12 billion more for international  affairs programs, 29 percent higher than the President\u2019s request.  This includes $2.9 billion more \nthan the request for economic and development assistance, including funding for the West \nBank/Gaza, Syria, and Pakistan, where our foreign aid is either frozen or under review.  It \nincludes $700 million more than requested for the United Nations, including restoring funding \nfor the United Nations Population Fund. The bill would also undermine the President\u2019s Mexico \nCity Policy (Presidential Memorandum of January 23, 2017), which prohibits the funding of \nforeign nongovernmental organizations that promote or perform abortions.  Further, H.R. 21 \nincludes approximately $2 billion in excessive Environmental Protection Agency funding, \nproviding funds beyond the Agency\u2019s core mission and including funding for programs that can \nand should be executed at the local level.  The bill also includes substantial unrequested funding \nfor HUD programs, including $7.1 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request for HUD rental \nassistance programs.  These and other excessive spending items makes the lack of adequate \nborder funding in the combined package all the more unacceptable. \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that will \nadequately secure the Nation\u2019s borders and get the Federal Government back to work for the \nAmerican people as soon as possible. \nIf either H.R. 21 or H.J.

Susan Davis, D-CA, and 44 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration opposes  passage of  H.R. 8294.  The mission of the Department of Labor\u2019s \nEmployment and Training Administration is  to expand access to high-quality job training and \nemployment opportunities.  Unfortunately, H.R. 8294 would undermine the ability of the \nDepartment of Labor  to perform that  mission under the mistaken belief that the government, \nrather than employers or  jobseekers, is best suited to determine the skills and competencies \nnecessary for success on the job.  This bill  would  also  require a one-size-fits-all approach to \napprenticeship that would stifle the Department\u2019s ability to promote innovation in the  \napprenticeship system and ensure that as many Americans as possible have access to high-\nquality work-based learning opportunities.  At the same time, it would limit  the ability of the \nDepartment to promote labor standards necessary to safeguard the welfare of apprentices.  \nIn the name of expanding apprenticeship opportunities, H.R. 8294 would eliminate such \nopportunities  at a  time when many Americans are struggling to find a family-sustaining job.  \nEffective workforce development and education initiatives  require collaboration with employers. \nThe command-and-control method of skill identification and development embodied in this bill  \nfails to reflect labor market realities and the necessity of continually adapting programs to keep \npace with changing business practices.   \nThe Administration has consistently recognized the value of the earn-and-learn opportunities that  \napprenticeships provide and has worked to promote apprenticeships.   Since President Trump \ntook office, more than 850,000 apprentices have been hired thanks to efforts to support economic \nopportunity for all Americans.  On June 15, 2017,  President Trump signed an executive order  \ncreating the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion.  This Task Force, which includes  \nemployers, labor unions, and educators,  identified the following as key factors in the success of \nthe apprenticeship model: the development of progressively advancing workplace-relevant skills \nand knowledge, paid work,  an educational component, structured mentorship, and the attainment \nof an industry-recognized credential.   The Task Force found that the Registered Apprenticeship \nprogram  succeeded in the area of building trades but the rigid framework of the program limited \nthe adoption of Registered Apprenticeships by  other industries  in a 21st  century economy.   \nBased on these findings, the Administration used  the  flexibility provided under the National  \nApprenticeship Act to create the complementary Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Program.  \nIndustry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs are individual  programs that participate in the   program as a whole, and they are  helping  employers create more earn-and-learn  opportunities for \nAmerican jobseekers, including traditionally under-represented populations,  in new and \nemerging fields and occupations.  \n \nThe Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Program  has already engaged  a broader  array of \nindustries, a larger number of employers, and a more diverse population than the Registered  \nApprenticeship program.  This program recognizes the important  role of employers and \nemployer associations  in  making programmatic decisions while ensuring labor market \nprotections and increasing pay transparency.  Moreover, the program  is increasing  economic \nopportunity for all Americans while increasing diversity and inclusion in the workplace.  \nProgram  administrators are responsible for performing outreach to diverse populations and \nensuring apprentices are protected from harassment, intimidation, and retaliation,  while \nindividual employers commit to reporting on the future employment and earnings of apprentices.  \nUnfortunately, H.R. 8294 would eliminate the  authority of the Department of Labor to  leverage \nadditional apprenticeship models, such as Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, \nthereby  reducing apprenticeship opportunities  for workers who do not have access to them now  \nand rolling back worker  protections.  \n \nIf H.R.  8294  were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  \n \n* * * * * * *  \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \n October 1, 2020 \n (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 8406 \u2013 The HEROES Act \n(Rep.

Lowey, D-NY)  \nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5687, which would make  emergency  \nsupplemental appropriations for the fiscal  year  ending September 30, 2020.  Division A  \nof the bill provides an additional $4.7 billion  in disaster relief  designed for  Puerto Rico, \nwhich is already projected to receive $90 billion in disaster funds.  Division B would \nmake permanent changes to  the Nation\u2019s tax code and provide  more than $15 billion in \nFederal subsidies that are unrelated to immediate disaster relief  and recovery.   Further, \nthe House is rushing this  bill through its process\u2014and seeking to push taxpayer dollars  \nout the door\u2014even before the Federal Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA) has \ncompleted its review of the damage caused by  earthquakes that have recently affected the \nisland.   \nThe Administration has taken unprecedented steps to help the people of Puerto Rico after  \nrecent disasters.  FEMA\u2019s response  to Hurricane Maria was  historic in scope, including the  \nlongest sustained air support  mission in United States history, which provided food and \nwater  to the island, the largest disaster commodity distribution mission in United States  \nhistory, and the largest sea-bridge operation of  Federal disaster  aid in United States  \nhistory.  In addition, President  Trump approved funding for 100 percent of  Puerto Rico\u2019s  \nemergency work  cost-share for nearly  a  year, the third longest period of time  ever  granted \nby a President.   For Hurricane Maria alone,  FEMA  has completed  more than 110,000 \nrepairs of individual homes, approved $3.5 billion in assistance to individuals, and granted  \n$6.1 billion in public assistance.  The Department of Housing  and Urban Development  has  \nreleased $9.7 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster  Recovery  funding.  \nOf this total, $1.5 billion has been obligated, but Puerto Rico has spent only  $11 million.  \nTo date, the Federal Government has allocated a total of  $44 billion across 14 agencies to \ndisasters in Puerto Rico, and of those funds, $22 billion has been obligated.  Of the amount  \nobligated, $8 billion remains unspent.  In total, the  overall spending on these disasters in \nPuerto Rico is projected to be  at least $90 billion. \nFEMA has similarly acted swiftly to respond to the earthquakes that began in \nDecember 2019.  On January 16, 2020, the President issued a major disaster declaration,  \nmaking available public and individual assistance  to address damage on the island.  To  \ndate, FEMA has  provided $54 million for earthquake response efforts.  The current  \nbalance in FEMA\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund is $43 billion, demonstrating the  presence of  \nsubstantial available resources.   In addition, FEMA has provided more than $1.4 million in  direct financial assistance to individuals and families in Puerto Rico to help them recover  \nfrom the recent earthquakes.   The Department of  Transportation has also provided another  \n$5 million in quick-release Emergency Relief highway funds  to meet immediate  \ninfrastructure recovery needs    \n \nDuring the initial earthquake response, at the request of the Government of Puerto Rico, \nFEMA provided nearly 1.1 million liters of water,  5,000 cots,  and nearly 163,000 meals to \nfulfill commodity  requests from the affected municipalities and  to help survivors recover.  \nFEMA also provided 20 tanker trucks to transport  water, also  at the request of the \nCommonwealth.  \n \nHowever, neither Puerto Ricans nor  the American  taxpayers benefit when  emergency  aid  \nis misallocated, lost, or stolen  through waste, fraud,  and abuse.  Puerto Rico has a long  \nhistory of inadequate  financial controls over regular  government operations, which forced \nthe Congress to appoint a financial control board in 2016.  Multiple high-profile cases of  \ncorruption have marred distribution of aid already  appropriated and have led to ongoing  \npolitical instability on the island.    \n \nThis  misguided  bill would add $4.7  billion on top of  all of the billions  already  allocated  to \nPuerto Rico, and its restrictive provisions  would prevent the Administration from ensuring  \nthese  funds are well-spent.   Additionally, the  creation  of in excess  of $15  billion in  new  \nFederal subsidies through the tax code would add billions of dollars to the deficit and \nundermine efforts to put the  Commonwealth on a  path to sustained economic growth and \nfiscal self-sufficiency.  \n \nIf  H.R. 5687  were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would \nrecommend that he veto it.  \n \n* * * * * * *  \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nOctober 28, 2019 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 1373 \u2013 Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act \n(Rep.

The Administration is strongly opposed to the budgetary framework that \nunderlies this and other appropriations bills being considered by the House of Representatives.  \nThis framework would raise the discretionary spending caps by more than $350 billion in fiscal \nyears (FY) 2020 and 2021 and does not reflect either a House-passed budget resolution or a \nbipartisan, bicameral agreement.  It would put the Federal Government on track to add nearly \n$2 trillion to deficits over 10 years, adding significantly to the national debt, which is already \nmore than $22 trillion and rising.   \nIn addition, the House Democrats\u2019 framework continues to adhere to the misguided and \nunfounded notion that increases to defense spending must be matched or exceeded by increases \nto non-defense spending.  In fact, the appropriations bills under consideration would provide \nmore than twice as much additional funding in FY 2020 for non-defense programs as for defense \nprograms, relative to FY 2019 levels.  Investing in our national security remains a key \nAdministration priority, but strengthening our defense does not require additional non-defense \ndiscretionary spending.  \nOverall, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would appropriate $321.9 billion, \n$25.7 billion, or 8.7 percent, above the FY 2020 Budget request and $29.8 billion above the \nFY 2019 enacted level.  In addition, this legislation includes a number of particularly \nproblematic provisions implicating key Administration priorities, including provisions that \nwould prohibit the use of FY 2020 or prior-year military construction funding to design, \nconstruct, or carry out projects along the southern border; preclude the use of appropriated funds \nto implement the 2020 Decennial Census questions as submitted to the Congress in March 2018; \nand prevent the Administration from finalizing key rules at the Departments of Transportation \nand Housing and Urban Development. \nIf H.R. 3055 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he veto it.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nbill. \nDivision A\u2014Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020 \nDepartment of Commerce (DOC) \nTrade Enforcement. The Administration appreciates the support the bill provides for DOC\u2019s \nInternational Trade Administration and Bureau of Industry and Security trade enforcement \nprograms.  These programs are key parts of the Administration\u2019s efforts to address unfair trade \npractices impacting United States businesses and national security. \nCensus Bureau. While the Administration is committed to a fair, modern, and accurate 2020 \nDecennial Census, the bill provides $1.6 billion more than what is needed for Census\u2019s Periodic \nPrograms and Censuses account to support all planned preparation, scale up, and operations \nanticipated in 2020.  In addition, the bill proposes to adjust the non-defense discretionary caps by \n$7.5 billion to accommodate the costs of the Decennial Census.  The Administration opposes this \nadjustment as the Decennial Census is neither unanticipated nor an emergency, which is the \ncriteria for other discretionary cap adjustments.  The Administration also strongly opposes \nlanguage in section 534 of the bill that would preclude the use of appropriated funds to \nimplement the 2020 Decennial Census questions as submitted to the Congress in March 2018. \nDOC Departmental Management.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not adopt \nthe Administration\u2019s proposal to elevate and expand the Office of Space Commerce.  Failing to \nadopt the FY 2020 Budget request to improve space traffic management and situational \nawareness would weaken the ability of commercial satellites to safely operate in a congested \nspace environment. \nDOC Program Eliminations and Savings. The Administration is disappointed the bill continues \nto fund DOC bureaus and programs proposed for elimination in the FY 2020 Budget request, \nincluding the Economic Development Administration, and Sea Grant.  The Administration urges \nthe Congress to discontinue funding for these duplicative, unauthorized, and lower priority \nprograms. \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) \nFederal Law Enforcement. The Administration appreciates the $15.7 billion provided for DOJ\u2019s \nFederal law enforcement components.  These resources would support ongoing efforts to address \ncounterterrorism, the opioid crisis, and violent crime.  \nExecutive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR).  The Administration appreciates the funding \nprovided to address the pending caseload by enhancing the efficacy and efficiency of EOIR\u2019s \nimmigration adjudication programs.  However, the Administration objects to section 218 of the \nbill which would prohibit EOIR from incorporating case completion metrics into individual \nperformance evaluations for immigration judges.  The Administration believes that setting case \ncompletion goals for Immigration Judges is one important tool to address the system\u2019s \nunacceptable backlog and efficiently manage the docket overall. \n2  Legal Representation Funding. The Administration opposes the establishment of an \nImmigration Representation Pilot grant program.  Such a program may be inconsistent with the \npolicy directive in section 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act that aliens in removal \nhearings are not entitled to Government-funded representation. \nCombating the Opioid Crisis. The Administration greatly appreciates the resources provided to \naddress the opioid epidemic, including the $2.8 billion provided for the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration and the $375 million provided for Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act \ngrants.  These resources would help to address the opioid crisis in communities across the \nNation. \nFirst Step Act. The Administration appreciates that the bill provides $75 million, the authorized \nlevel of funding, to support the historic First Step Act of 2018.  The Act puts into place \ncommonsense reforms to make our justice system fairer and help inmates successfully transition \nback into society. The Administration is committed to fully implementing the Act and would \nutilize this funding to expand inmate access to evidence-based, recidivism-reducing programs. \nProject Safe Neighborhoods (PSN).  The Administration is disappointed that the bill fails to \nprovide funding for the PSN program.  PSN brings together law enforcement and their \ncommunities to develop effective, locally-based strategies to reduce violent crime.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure the necessary funding is in \nplace to fully support efforts to create safer neighborhoods through sustained reductions in \nviolent crime. \nFederal Prisoner Detention. The Administration strongly urges the Congress to fully fund the \nFederal Prisoner Detention account at the level included in the FY 2020 Budget request.  The \nU.S.Marshals Service (USMS) pre-trial detainee population has increased significantly since \nApril 2017 due to enhanced enforcement of immigration, weapons, and drug offenses.  While the \nUSMS has identified and is in the process of implementing cost saving measures in response to \nthe population increases, additional funds are required to adequately support current and \nanticipated population increases. \nBureau of Prisons. The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not cancel funding for \nan unnecessary prison project in Letcher County, Kentucky, as proposed by the FY 2020 Budget \nrequest.  After years of declining inmate populations nationwide, it is wasteful to pursue a \nfacility that is estimated to cost the taxpayers more than $500 million and continues to be \nplagued by delays and cost overruns. \nSanctuary Jurisdictions. The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the amendments \nrequested in section 217 of the DOJ general provisions of the FY 2020 Budget.  These \namendments would clarify that Federal, State, and local governments must comply with \nimmigration detainer requests and authorizes the Department of Homeland Security and DOJ to \ncondition financial assistance on cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement activities \nand requests. \nFirearm Protections. The Administration is concerned that the bill excludes certain second \namendment related protections that have been included in prior appropriations acts, such as those \n3  related to the import and export of certain firearms.  The Administration urges the Congress to \ninclude these provisions. \nCrime Victims Fund (CVF). The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not adopt the \nFY 2020 Budget request proposal to eliminate the use of the CVF change in a mandatory \nprogram\u2014or CHIMP.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to \nreform the CVF to eliminate this budget gimmick, limit receipts deposited into the fund, and to \nprovide predictable and sufficient funding for crime victims and victim services. \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \nNASA Exploration Research and Development.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s \ninvestments in NASA.  However, the Administration is disappointed that the bill provides far \nless funding than is needed to support the Administration\u2019s goal of a near-term human lunar \nlanding.  Instead, the bill diverts funding to support lower-priority activities within the Agency. \nThe Administration strongly urges the Congress to redirect this funding to allow the United \nStates to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024 as an important step on our way to Mars. \nNational Science Foundation (NSF) \nNSF Topline. The Administration is concerned that the bill funds NSF at $1.6 billion above the \nlevel in the FY 2020 Budget request.  This unrequested funding undermines the Administration\u2019s \nefforts to rein in non-defense discretionary funding. \nLegal Services Corporation (LSC) \nLSC Topline.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not eliminate Federal funding \nfor LSC, which would save the American taxpayer more than $400 million per year.  The \nAdministration seeks to end the one-size-fits-all model of providing legal services through a \nsingle grant program by putting more control in the hands of State and local governments which \nbetter understand the needs of their communities. \nDivision B\u2014Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, 2020 \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) \nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  The \nAdministration appreciates the $6 billion funding level provided by the bill for the WIC \nprogram, which includes an $800 million rescission of unobligated balances.  This level is \nsufficient to serve all projected eligible participants. \nAgriculture Building and Facilities. The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for USDA \nfacilities including modernization and implementation of USDA\u2019s OneNeighborhood Initiative \nin the National Capital Region.  The bill provides $331 million consistent with the FY 2020 \nBudget request. \n4  Public Law 480 Title II Food Aid (Title II).  The Administration opposes providing food aid \nfunding through use of Title II and prefers providing all food aid through the International \nHumanitarian Assistance account, as proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request, which \nconsolidates overseas humanitarian assistance programs and funding of the Department of State \nand U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  While the United States is the \nworld\u2019s largest donor of food aid, taxpayers expect such aid to be provided in the most cost-\neffective manner possible.  Title II is cost-inefficient, slow, and limits USAID\u2019s ability to use the \nmost appropriate food aid intervention for a particular crisis. \nMcGovern Dole International Food for Education.  The Administration is disappointed that the \nbill provides $235 million in funding for the McGovern Dole International Food for Education \nprogram, which has been proposed for elimination in every budget request since FY 2018.  \nMcGovern-Dole has unaddressed oversight and performance monitoring challenges and is \nduplicative of USAID programs.  \nAgriculture Research Agency Relocation.  The Administration opposes language in the bill that \nwould prohibit funding that is appropriated to the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the \nNational Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to be used to relocate ERS or NIFA outside \nthe National Capital Region, including language under the ERS and NIFA headings and in \nsections 755, 758, and 759.  Relocation of ERS and NIFA would bring Federal resources closer \nto the stakeholders which USDA serves. The relocation would improve USDA\u2019s ability to \nattract and retain highly qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture, many of whom \ncome from the land-grant universities dispersed across rural America. \nJob Corps Civilian Conservation Centers. The Administration opposes section 780 of that bill \nthat would prevent funds from being used to alter the USDA role in the Job Corps program in \nany manner.  The Administration is pursuing reforms to Job Corps that would allow the USDA \nForest Service to better focus on its core natural resource mission and unify program \nresponsibility at the Department of Labor, which would improve efficiency for the disadvantaged \nyouth the program serves.  In contrast, section 780 would ensure that funds continue to be spent \non low performing Job Corps centers that are failing to meet the needs of students and wasting \ntaxpayer funds. \nNew Swine Slaughter Inspection System Rule. The Administration opposes section 779 of the \nbill that would prohibit USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service from implementing a \nproposal to modernize the inspection of hog slaughter plants until the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral reviews the data used to develop the proposed rule.  \nCommodity Credit Corporation. The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not \ninclude language requested in the FY 2020 Budget that would allow USDA to use the \nCommodity Credit Corporation\u2019s third quarter financial statement to provide an interim \nreimbursement of net realized losses prior to the completion of the FY 2019 financial statement.  \nRural Broadband Pilot Program. The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for this high \npriority program that would provide vital broadband infrastructure for rural America.  USDA is \nworking to implement the initial $1.2 billion enacted in FYs 2018 and 2019, most of which is \nunobligated.  The bill provides an additional $550 million for the rural broadband pilot, while the \n5  FY 2020 Budget only requested an additional $200 million which the Administration believes is \nsufficient given the availability of prior year funding.  \nRural Housing Loans and Grants. The Administration is disappointed that the bill misses an \nopportunity to fund mortgage lending in a way that utilizes the private banking industry to \nprovide home loans, through USDA\u2019s single family housing loan guarantee program, as the more \nefficient way to deliver this assistance.  In total, the bill provides $1.7 billion for the USDA\u2019s \nhousing programs, which is $312 million above the FY 2020 Budget request.  The bill diverges \nfrom the priorities in the FY 2020 Budget request by funding the direct housing loans and grants \nprogram at historical levels. \nNatural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  The Administration opposes the $167 million \nin unrequested funding provided in the bill for the small, private watershed infrastructure and \nrehabilitation efforts administered NRCS.  While many of these watershed projects were initially \nconstructed with Federal funding, maintenance and rehabilitation of these projects are more \nappropriately the responsibility of local entities.  \nRural Business\u2014Cooperative Service.  The Administration proposes to eliminate Rural Business \nCooperative Service grant programs in the FY 2020 Budget request. These grant programs have \nfailed to meet goals and are duplicative of private sector assistance.  The bill provides $119 \nmillion, $98 million above the FY 2020 Budget request.  \nAgricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides \nexcessive funding for the AMS without adopting the savings proposed in the FY 2020 Budget \nrequest.  The bill provides $68 million above the FY 2020 Budget request for AMS, including \nunrequested funding for the National Organic Program.  \nUSDA Research Programs. The bill provides $3.3 billion for research programs, $425 million \nabove the FY 2020 Budget request. The FY 2020 Budget request targeted research to \ncompetitive grant programs while supporting primary research and reducing lower priority \nduplicative research areas. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \nFDA.  The Administration appreciates additional funding provided in the bill to a number of key \nmedical product safety and food safety initiatives, including increases as requested in the \nFY 2020 Budget to strengthen safety of the Nation\u2019s blood supply, compounded drugs, and to \nimprove medical countermeasure development.  The bill also includes requested increases to \nadvance FDA\u2019s efforts to promote innovation and food safety.  The Administration appreciates \nthat the Committee adopted an amendment to restore section 778 of the bill, to protect human \nembryos by prohibiting FDA from accepting and reviewing any applications involving human \nembryos that have been intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic \nmodification, and strongly urges the Congress to retain this provision in the final bill. \n6  Division C\u2014Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2020 \nDepartment of the Interior (DOI) \nDOI Topline. The Administration is concerned that the bill would provide $13.8 billion for DOI, \nwhich is $2.4 billion above the FY 2020 Budget request. \nDOI Reorganization. The Administration is concerned that the bill provides no funding to \nsupport the reorganization of DOI, an initiative focused on making DOI more efficient and \nresponsive to the public.  The Administration strongly opposes efforts to block these important \nand bold reforms. \nObjectionable Energy Language Provisions. The Administration strongly opposes provisions \nthat would block authorized activities that promote America\u2019s energy security.  This includes \nlanguage in section 117 of the bill that would effectively prohibit pre-leasing and other activities \nin certain areas of the Outer Continental Shelf, and language in section 118 of the bill that would \nimpose arbitrary criteria prior to conducting authorized lease sales in Coastal Plain of the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. \nDOI and USDA, Forest Service \nFederal Land Acquisition. The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides \n$216 million above the FY 2020 Budget request for Federal Land Acquisition.  Adding land to \nthe Federal estate is a lower priority because USDA and DOI already manage roughly 700 \nmillion acres of land and the focus should be on addressing the backlog on deferred maintenance.  \nForest and Hazardous Fuels Management.  The Administration appreciates the hazardous fuels \nfunds provided in the bill to support forest landscape management priorities across both \ndepartments. Providing the full requested level of $644 million would allow the agencies to \nreduce wildfire risk by treating more areas. \nUSDA, Forest Service \nUSDA Forest Service Topline.  The Administration appreciates the increased transparency of the \nrevised budget structure reflected in the bill.  However, the Administration is concerned that the \nbill would provide $3.7 billion for non-wildfire activities at the Forest Service, which is $891 \nmillion above the FY 2020 Budget request. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nEPA Topline. The Administration is concerned that the bill would provide $9.5 billion for EPA, \nwhich is $3.3 billion above the FY 2020 Budget request.  The bill provides significant funding \nfor additional activities and programs that go beyond EPA\u2019s core statutory and regulatory \nrequirements to protect air, land, and water resources, and ensure the safety of chemicals. \n7  Environmental Grants.  The Administration continues to recommend reductions to EPA\u2019s State \nand Tribal Assistance Grants account, which the bill would fund at $2 billion above the FY 2020 \nBudget Request.  Within this account, the bill provides significant unrequested funding, \nincluding support for categorical grants and activities that may go beyond statutory mandates. \nEPA\u2019s Science and Technology Account. The Administration continues to recommend \nreductions to the Science and Technology account, which is funded at $301 million above the \nFY 2020 Budget request.  Reductions to this account would reduce extramural Federal funding \nfor environmental research and development activities that would more appropriately be funded \nand conducted by entities outside of the Federal Government. \nOther Independent Agencies \nNational Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and \nthe Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (Wilson Center).  The Administration is \ndisappointed that the bill does not eliminate or reduce Federal funding for NEA, NEH, and \nWilson Center as proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request.  The Administration recognizes the \npositive effects the arts and humanities have on our communities; however the FY 2020 Budget \nrequest proposed an orderly phase-out of Federal funding for these agencies, as the \nAdministration does not consider their activities to be core Federal responsibilities. \nDivision D\u2014Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct, 2020 \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) \nBorder Security Funding and Authority. The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s lack of \nfunding for DOD\u2019s border-related military construction requirements and prohibition on the use \nof FY 2020 or prior-year military construction funding to design, construct, or carry out projects \nalong the southern border.  The security and humanitarian crisis at the border is a national \nemergency, and this funding is vital to build the border barriers needed to help secure and \nmanage the southern border.  \nHurricane Relief. The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support to fund the replacement or \nreconstruction of facilities damaged beyond repair by Hurricanes Florence and Michael and also \nby significant flooding in Nebraska. \nReprioritization of Military Construction Funding to Unrequested Projects.  The Administration \nobjects to the bill\u2019s realignment of military construction funding from priority projects to other \nprojects not included the FY 2020 Budget request.  Contrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally \nresponsible policy to fully fund projects, the bill proposes to incrementally fund 20 military \nconstruction projects, effectively creating an unfunded obligation of $1.4 billion needed to fully \nfund these projects over time.  In addition, the bill diverts $1 billion requested in the FY 2020 \nBudget to fully fund priority projects, or from rescissions of prior year funds, to other \nunrequested projects. \n8  Reprogramming Guidelines. The Administration strongly objects to the one percent \nreprogramming threshold for military construction and family housing projects. This limitation \nsignificantly hinders the ability to reprogram funds without prior congressional notice and would \nsubsequently have negative consequences on the timely execution of many projects, which could \nlead to unnecessary cost increases.  Market conditions are changing steadily due to recent events \nsuch as hurricanes resulting in increased labor and material costs.  The Department would have \nvirtually no flexibility to manage and execute the military construction and family housing \nprograms since a one percent increase would equate to $550,000, based on the average cost of an \nFY 2020 construction project, which is $55 million. \nDetention Facilities at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s \nlack of funding for the high-value detention facility replacement at Naval Station Guantanamo \nBay. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nDiscretionary Funding and VA MISSION Act of 2018. The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s \nrobust funding level of $94.3 billion in discretionary appropriations for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA).  This level fully supports the Administration\u2019s highest priorities for \nveterans\u2019 programs, including implementation of the VA MISSION Act of 2018.   However, the \nAdministration understands that the House Majority would like to provide funding related to the \nVA MISSION Act of 2018 outside of the statutory non-defense discretionary spending cap, \nwhich the Administration would strongly oppose.  All funding for the VA MISSION Act of 2018 \nshould be included within the FY 2020 non-defense discretionary cap. \nDivision E\u2014Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2020 \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) \nCapital Investment Grants (CIG). The Administration opposes policy provisions, as well as \noverly prescriptive administrative provisions, that contravene the current law, regulations, and \nguidance of the CIG program.  The Administration believes that funding allocations should be \nmade based on defined criteria and that the directives in the bill that affect local cost share, \ncontingency funding requirements, and pre-determination of project award selection would cause \ntaxpayers to assume more risk for complicated, multiyear projects. \nAmtrak.  The Administration is disappointed the bill continues the status quo, providing \n$2 billion for all Amtrak operations, including its highly inefficient long-distance trains.  The \nAdministration believes that there is a real opportunity to reform and improve Amtrak service \nacross the United States.  The FY 2020 Budget request would leverage the Restoration and \nEnhancements grant program to begin a collaborative process with stakeholders to undertake a \nmulti-year process to restructure the network, which has not markedly changed in over 40 years.  \nDOT Rulemaking Prohibitions. The Administration strongly objects to provisions prohibiting \nDOT from finalizing vital regulations, particularly section 145 of the bill, which would prohibit \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) from finalizing or enforcing the \n9  Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule which has the potential to save more than \n12,700 lives and save society more than $250 billion.  In addition, the Administration strongly \nobjects to efforts to limit DOT from finalizing and enforcing hours of service regulations to \nensure the safe and efficient operation of commercial vehicles on the Nation\u2019s roads. \nCalifornia High Speed Rail. The Administration objects to section 192 of the bill that would \nprohibit DOT from terminating, de-obligating, and requiring repayment of expended funding \nunder grant agreements with the California High Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) in effect on the \ndate of enactment of the act.  The responsibility for grant oversight and management should \nremain with DOT, including any potential resulting action the Department may need to take as \nsteward of Federal funds in its review of CHSRA\u2019s grant agreement for $2.5 billion in funding \nprovided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. \nEssential Air Service (EAS). The Administration is disappointed that the bill did not include the \nAdministration\u2019s FY 2020 Budget proposals to reform the EAS program at DOT.  The \nAdministration believes that common-sense, modest reforms can be implemented to control \ncosts, while ensuring that truly remote communities receive air service. \nTransportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) Non-Federal Project Share. \nThe Administration opposes language in the bill that could eliminate the requirement for \nTIFIA-supported projects to be funded at least 20 percent by non-Federal assistance.  The \nlanguage could impede TIFIA\u2019s effectiveness in leveraging Federal resources to generate non-\nFederal investment, and could increase the default risk of projects.  \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \nRental Assistance Programs.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides \n$45.1 billion, $7.1 billion above the FY 2020 Budget request, for HUD\u2019s rental assistance \nprograms.  The bill continues to reflect the status quo and does not adopt the FY 2020 Budget\u2019s \nproposed legislative reforms to Housing Choice Vouchers, Project-Based Rental Assistance, \nPublic Housing, and Housing for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities.  The \nAdministration\u2019s proposal includes uniform work requirements, as well as offers public housing \nauthorities, private property owners, and HUD-assisted families a simpler and more transparent \nset of rent structures to reduce administrative burden, incentivize work, and place HUD\u2019s rental \nassistance programs on a more fiscally sustainable path. \nProposed Grant Eliminations. The Administration opposes the $3.6 billion provided in the bill \nfor the Community Development Block Grant program, as the program is not well-targeted to \nthe most distressed areas and has not demonstrated measurable impacts on communities.  The \nAdministration also opposes the $1.8 billion provided in the bill for the HOME Investment \nPartnerships Program because State and local governments can more effectively address the \nunique market challenges, local regulations, and impediments that lead to housing affordability \nproblems for households across the Nation.  In addition, the Administration opposes the \n$300 million provided in this bill for Choice Neighborhoods since State and local governments \nare better positioned than the Choice Neighborhoods program to fund locally driven strategies \nfor neighborhood revitalization.  In total, these eliminations would save $5.7 billion in FY 2020, \nwhich could be directed to higher priority needs.  \n10  HUD Rulemaking Prohibitions. The Administration objects to section 234 of the bill that would \nprevent HUD from proceeding with the proposed rule to align HUD\u2019s regulations for housing \nassistance to current law, which prohibits persons other than United States citizens and other \neligible noncitizens from receiving HUD rental assistance.  Section 236 of the bill would also \nprevent HUD from proceeding with the proposed rule to allow grantees participating in programs \nwhich permit single-sex facilities to have greater flexibility in establishing their own policies, \nconsistent with State and local laws.  In addition, section 237 of the bill would statutorily codify \nan outdated guidance notice on this subject.  The Administration opposes such provisions as they \nwould impede the Administration\u2019s rulemaking process and authority.  \nDivision F\u2014Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act of 2019 \nThe Administration opposes division F of the bill, which provides back pay for contractors \nduring a lapse in appropriations. While contractors play an important role in helping \nGovernment agencies meet their missions, this legislation ignores important principles of Federal \ncontracting, and would lead to increased cost and a significant increase in the risk of fraud, \nwaste, and improper payment. The Administration anticipates significant, disruptive, and costly \nchallenges in trying to force-fit the requirements of contractor back-pay legislation into an \nacquisition system that is not designed or equipped to manage contractor employees, making it \ndifficult, if not impossible, to meet the dual goals of paying quickly and paying accurately. \nConstitutional Concerns \nCertain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, certain provisions \nwould interfere with the President\u2019s constitutional authority and duty to protect national security, \nas well as his authority as Commander in Chief. Another provision would violate the \nRecommendations Clause of the Constitution while other provisions would intrude upon the \nPresident\u2019s constitutional authority over international diplomacy.  Other provisions would \ncontravene the constitutional separation of powers between the Executive Branch and the \nCongress, and another could infringe on the President\u2019s constitutional authority to control the \ndisclosure of information that is subject to executive privilege. The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to address these concerns. \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2020 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n* * * * * * * \n11  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nFebruary 10, 2020  \n(House Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R.2546 \u2013 Protecting America\u2019s Wilderness  Act  \n(Rep.  DeGette, D-CO, and Rep. Neguse, D-CO)  \nThe Administration opposes  H.R. 2546.  This bill  would impose unnecessary and harmful  \nrestrictions on more than 2.5 million acres of land in Colorado, California, and Washington \nState, including nearly 1.5  million acres in the form  of  wilderness designations.  These  \nrestrictions  will greatly reduce opportunities for  multiple  uses on these public lands, limit access  \nto them, and significantly reduce the  available productive acreage  in working forests, rendering \nthem  more prone to catastrophic  wildfires.    \nThe Administration has expanded  access to America\u2019s public lands;  increased hunting, fishing, \nand recreational opportunities nationwide; and enhanced conservation stewardship  of our  vast  \nnatural resources.  With regard to the designation of  wilderness on public lands, the  \nAdministration  generally supports  congressional action  to  resolve  wilderness designation and \nWilderness Study Areas  (WSA) release issues, particularly for  WSAs  that were established  more  \nthan 30 years ago.  Many WSAs  were  recommended for designation, while others  were  \nrecommended as not  suitable, with suggestions  that they be returned to agency  management to  \nintegrate their other intrinsic values  into surrounding land management plans.  The  \nAdministration recommends  addressing these long overdue WSA decisions before undertaking \npotential designations  of  new areas that did not meet the  criteria  established in the  1964 \nWilderness Act  when inventories were completed  many  years ago.   \nThe Administration strongly believes  that before  new  or potential wilderness  areas or  wild and \nscenic rivers  are designated, it  is  important to first ensure that  such designation  is  the most \nappropriate land management tool  for a given parcel.  For this  and other reasons, successful  \nconservation proposals  that have incorporated this  tool over the last decade have been more \nlimited  in geographic scope  than this  bill.  It is important to ensure that designating new  \nwilderness  areas on public lands does not unnecessarily impede public  access, limit  outdoor  \nrecreational opportunities, or conflict with pre-existing uses.   Unfortunately, a number  of the  \nproposals for  wilderness  designations in H.R. 2546 fail to follow this successful model.  \nWhile many recreational  activities, such as hunting, fishing, and hiking, are compatible with  \nwilderness designation, other  activities, such as mountain biking and off-highway  vehicle use, \nare not.  Some  of the areas proposed for  wilderness designation in H.R. 2546 contain popular  \nmotorized or  mechanized recreation areas.  In addition, existing energy development poses  \ninherent challenges for  wilderness designations, creating complex  management issues pertaining \nto active mining claims and oil and gas leases within a designated wilderness  area.

Res. 54 \u2013 Terminating the National Emergency \nDeclared by the President on the Southern Border\n (Sen. Udall, D-NM, and two cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly opposes S.J. Res. 54.  This resolution would undermine the \nAdministration\u2019s ability to respond effectively to the ongoing crisis at the Southern Border \nby terminating the national emergency the President declared on February 15, 2019.  The \nSouthern Border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics, \nand the crisis threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency. \nIn addition, security challenges at the Southern Border exacerbate an ongoing humanitarian \ncrisis that threatens the well-being of vulnerable populations, including women and \nchildren.  While the Administration has made great strides in tightening border security \nwith the use of available statutory authorities, countering large-scale unlawful migration \nand humanitarian challenges across the Southern Border requires continued vigilance and \nthe dedication of available Federal resources.  \nThe President\u2019s emergency declaration invokes the same authority that President George \nW. Bush and President Barack Obama used to undertake more than 18 different military \nconstruction projects between 2001 and 2013.  When President Trump declared the \nnational emergency on the Southern Border in February 2019, it marked the sixtieth time \na President has used this authority since the enactment of the National Emergencies Act of \n1976. \nSince the President\u2019s declaration, the situation on the border has improved, and S.J. Res. 54 \nwould hinder the progress that is being made.  The Congress has acted in an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan manner to approve the provision of emergency resources to \naddress the crisis, and the Congress has agreed to a budget framework that expressly \npreserves the authorities the Administration is using to address the crisis.  Congress should \nnot vote to terminate the national emergency and remove important border security and \nhumanitarian tools from the Government\u2019s toolkit.  As the Administration continues to use \nits national emergency authorities to address the crisis on the border, its Fiscal Year 2020 \nbudget request calls on the Congress to ensure sufficient funding is provided to ensure these \nemergency measures do not delay other important investments across the Government. \nOn March 15, 2019, the President vetoed an identical resolution that would have terminated  the national emergency.

DeFazio, D-OR, and 3 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration appreciates the work of the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee  on H.R. 7575, the Water Resources  Development Act of 2020.  H.R. 7575  would \nadvance some of the Administration\u2019s policies and principles,  including building a foundation \nfor long-term economic growth, addressing significant risks to public safety, and protecting our \nenvironment.   The bill, however,  could be improved.  The Administration  looks forward to \nworking  with Congress to modify or remove certain provisions and to include others so that  this \nimportant legislation can achieve its full potential.    \nH.R. 7575  would authorize 38  new construction projects,  at a total cost of  more than  $10 billion,  \nand  41  new studies.   Given the large number of previously authorized projects that have not been \nstarted or completed, the priority for new project and study authorizations should go to  those  that \nwould most likely produce  high economic or environmental returns to the Nation and  to those  \nmost likely to address significant  risks  to public safety within one of the three main mission areas \nof the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps):  flood and storm damage reduction,  commercial  \nnavigation,  and aquatic  ecosystem restoration.    \nThe Administration appreciates  the  inclusion of section 137,  which would extend section 1043 \n(b) of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, as amended, to September 30, \n2026.  This authority, which allows the Corps to transfer Federal appropriations to a  non-Federal \nsponsor  for construction of  projects, is an important tool for improving how the Nation invests in \nand manages our water  resources.  It  helps accelerate the construction of infrastructure projects, \ngenerate cost efficiencies, and empower States and local communities to achieve their priorities. \nThe Administration also supports the goal of section 301, which would establish a process to \nidentify for deauthorization projects that no longer meet the Nation\u2019s needs.  The Administration,  \nhowever,  has concerns that similar provisions in previous  legislation  have not resulted in \nsubstantial deauthorizations  and believes the bill should be strengthened to ensure projects are \nactually deauthorized.   \nThe Administration  objects to  section 108, which would reduce the users\u2019  share of the cost of \ncapital projects on the inland waterways from  50  percent to 35  percent.  The Administration \nbelieves the users\u2019  share of these  investments should continue to be 50  percent.  The Corps has  \npreviously  estimated that the annual receipts from the existing diesel fuel tax cover less than 10  \npercent of the total cost that the Corps incurs  to support commercial navigation on these \nwaterways, after accounting for infrastructure  operation and maintenance costs, which are  \ncurrently borne by taxpayers.   Reducing the users\u2019 share of the cost of capital projects would  result in the taxpayer paying for nearly all of the cost that the Corps incurs to support \ncommercial  navigation on the inland waterways.  The Administration believes beneficiaries  \nshould pay their fair share.  \n \nThe Administration encourages Congress to enact additional reforms that would improve the  \nNation\u2019s management of water resources.  These include, for example,  an annual per-vessel fee \nthat would increase  the amount paid by commercial navigation users of the inland waterways.  \nThis fee would support economic growth, help cover the expected future construction and \noperating requirements of the inland waterways, and more accurately reflect actual  costs incurred  \nby the Corps on behalf of commercial users.  The current excise tax on diesel fuel used in \ncommerce  in inland waterways  will  not produce the revenue needed to cover these costs.  \n   \nThe Administration also objects to section 134 of  the bill.   This provision would require the \nSecretary of the Army to identify levee deficiencies, recommend repairs, and develop cost \nestimates for those  repairs  for up to roughly 9,000 levee systems without specifying the \nappropriate  cost share  for all of this work.   This work is now mostly the responsibility of levee \nowners.   If the bill were to require the work to be undertaken by the Federal Government, it  \nwould  undermine efforts to build up the capability of States to develop and run their own levee \nprograms.  In many cases, it also could result  in  slower  repair times, which would increase flood \nrisks.  \n \nThe Administration is concerned that sections 140 and 330 of the bill could result in the \nforgiveness of debt owed to the Federal Government for the non-Federal cost share of the \nconstruction of certain projects. While restructuring debt may be appropriate in some \ncircumstances, the administration is  concerned that these provisions, as written, are overly broad  \nand could result in significant losses of funds owed to the Treasury.  \n   \nThe Administration supports the goal of section 142, but has some concerns with the provision as \ndrafted.  The Administration has worked hard to ensure critical components of infrastructure \nprojects comply with \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions that already exist  in current  law.  Further, \nthrough Executive Order  13881, the Administration has tightened the domestic content standards \nrequired under the Buy American Act for a company to receive a preference in a Federal \nprocurement, including a requirement that iron or  steel must have 95% domestic content to be \nconsidered American-made.  The Administration believes Buy American  provisions are in the \nbest interests of Americans and American companies and would like to work with Congress to \nstrengthen the statutory Buy American  policy, while avoiding  schedule delays and unreasonable \nincreases  in construction costs.    \n \nFinally, the Administration encourages Congress to authorize  the Corps to divest of the \nWashington Aqueduct, which is  the only local water  supply system in the Nation owned and \noperated by the Corps.  The Administration believes that water supplies should be owned by  \nState or local governments, or  private sector  entities,  which are disciplined by appropriate  \nregulatory and market incentives.  \n \nThe Administration remains committed to working with the Congress  to improve  this legislation \nand address the Nation\u2019s water resources challenges.

Meeks, D-NY)  \nThe Administration opposes H.J.  Res. 90, a disapproval resolution under the Congressional \nReview Act of the final rule on Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Regulations  adopted by \nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  The Administration is dedicated to the  \npromotion of lending, investment, and enhanced economic activity in low- and moderate-income \nneighborhoods across our country, and this final rule is a reflection of that dedication.  The \nregulations  that the House seeks to overturn, in coordination with the Opportunity Zones \nprogram,  are a critical step in ensuring prosperity for all Americans, and the final rule increases  \nsupport for and investment in  small businesses, small- and family-owned farms, Indian Country, \nand distressed communities.  Unfortunately, H.J. Res. 90 does not recognize the important work \nthat has been completed to develop a final rule that helps Americans all  over the  Nation.  \nThe  final rule takes important steps to strengthen the CRA regulatory framework for OCC-\nregulated institutions by clarifying and bringing certainty to what qualifies for CRA \nconsideration.  It  also strengthens the regulatory framework  by  evaluating bank CRA \nperformance more objectively, updating how banks define their assessment areas, and making \nthe entire process  of bank efforts to fulfill the CRA\u2019s goals  more transparent and efficient.  \nAdditionally, the final  rule\u2019s framework  is readily applicable  to  banks  of all sizes and business  \nmodels.  \nThe final rule also incentivizes banks to achieve specific performance goals for lending.  As a \nresult, the Administration disagrees with the Resolution\u2019s  premise  that the OCC\u2019s CRA \nregulations weaken requirements to lend to low-income borrowers and communities.  Instead, \nthe Administration is confident that these incentives will lead to an increase in lending to these \nborrowers and communities  and an overall increase in total  lending.  The incentives provided by \nthe final  rule represent a  substantial  improvement from  the previous rule, under which  a bank\u2019s  \nperformance was rated on ambiguous, often subjective review criteria.    \nOverall, the  rule is the culmination of more than a decade of dialogue about improving how the \nCRA works.  Stakeholders submitted more than 7,500 comments on the regulations at the Notice \nof Proposed Rulemaking  stage, and the final rule incorporates  many of their suggestions.  The \nAdministration is confident that this rule will help small businesses and other entities, improve  \nhow the CRA works, and lead to an increase in total  lending.  \n \nIf H.J.

Hoyer, D-MD, and Rep. McCarthy, R-CA)  \nThe Administration strongly supports H.R. 5430, which approves and implements the United  \nStates-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The Agreement was  recently  signed by  all three \ncountries and will replace the 25-year-old North American  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with  a \n21st century, high-standard agreement that rebalances trade in North America and modernizes  \nthese important trading relationships. This historic and modern  Agreement will be the template for  \nall future United States trade agreements. After  a year of  advocacy across the country from  \nthousands of businesses, grassroots campaigns,  and elected officials, the Agreement  passed the  \nHouse  overwhelmingly last month. \nOne of President Trump\u2019s principal objectives when negotiating  a new deal with Canada and \nMexico to replace NAFTA was to ensure that the new Agreement benefits American workers.  The \nAgreement\u2019s rules of origin for  automotive goods secure this outcome by imposing a labor value  \ncontent rule requiring  at least 40-45 percent of  auto content be produced at  plants or facilities with \nan average wage of at least $16 per hour, in addition to increasing the regional content of the  \nvehicles to 75 percent.  \nThe Agreement also benefits American  farmers, ranchers,  and agribusinesses by  expanding  \nopportunities for exports of American products. It  does so by increasing market access into  \nCanada for  American dairy, poultry, and eggs; enhancing information exchange  and cooperation \nregarding  agricultural biotechnology trade-related matters; and improving transparency and \ncooperation to ensure non-discriminatory treatment for agricultural product standards.  \nThe Agreement also provides strong  and effective  protection and enforcement of intellectual  \nproperty rights critical to driving innovation, creating economic  growth, and supporting American \njobs. In addition, the Agreement\u2019s digital trade provisions provide a firm foundation for the  \nexpansion of trade and investment in the innovative products and services  where the  United States  \nhas a competitive advantage.  \nAdditionally, the Agreement includes commitments to liberalize financial services markets and  \nfacilitate a level playing field for United States financial institutions and enhance  cross-border \ntrade in financial services, while preserving the discretion of regulators to  protect financial \nstability.  For the  first time in a  United States trade agreement, the USMCA includes a dedicated  \nchapter on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which complements other key provisions  \nsupporting small and medium-sized businesses throughout the  Agreement.   Further, the Agreement includes a chapter on currency that targets competitive devaluations and \nincludes strong transparency provisions that are  enforceable through dispute settlement. It  also \nstrengthens protections against unfair trading practices by state-owned enterprises.  \n \nThe USMCA is a historic trade agreement that presents a tremendous opportunity  for all three  \ncountries by  greatly improving the outdated NAFTA. It substantially enhances protections for  \nworkers  and the environment and includes strong new mechanisms to  ensure those provisions are  \nenforced. It opens markets to United States manufacturers and farmers  and reduces trade barriers, \nthereby creating freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth throughout  all of North \nAmerica.  \n \nIf H.R. 5430 were presented to the President in its current form, he would sign the bill.  \n \n* * * * * * *  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nJuly 16, 2019 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS.J.Res. 38 \u2013 Providing for congressional disapproval of the proposed export to the \nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \nof certain defense articles and services \n(Sen.

Apart from negatively affecting our bilateral relationship with the \nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, the joint resolution would hamper our ability to sustain and shape \ncritical security cooperation activities and would significantly hinder the interoperability between \nour nations. \nAdditionally, the joint resolution would impact our partner\u2019s ability to deter and defend against \nIranian military aggression. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia serves as a bulwark against Iran and \nits proxies\u2019 malign activities in the region. Its civilians and the thousands of United States \ncitizens residing in Saudi Arabia continue to be threatened by attacks from the Iranian-backed \nHouthis in Yemen, and suffered an attack last month that injured 26 civilians. \nS.J.

Combined with this assistance, \nthe provision of precision-guided munitions would further help the Saudis mitigate the risk of \ncivilian casualties. \nIn addition to the joint resolution\u2019s adverse effects on our Middle East partner, it would also \nnegatively affect our NATO Allies and the transatlantic defense industry.

Maloney, D-NY, and  38  cosponsors)  \nThe Administration strongly opposes passage of H.R. 8015. Instead of reforming the United \nStates Postal Service (USPS)  to ensure its  continued viability in the modern economy, H.R. 8015 \nwould arbitrarily give USPS  $25 billion in \u201cemergency\u201d taxpayer funding,  without linking that \nfunding to either  the COVID-19 pandemic or the upcoming election. The  bill  would also prohibit \n\u201cany change in the nature of postal services which will generally affect service on a nationwide \nor substantially nationwide basis,\u201d and would explicitly tie this freeze on reforms to the period of \nthe COVID-19 public health emergency. By  doing so, H.R. 8015 seeks to exploit  the COVID-19 \npandemic as a pretext for placing counterproductive restrictions on USPS\u2019s already limited \noperational flexibilities.  \nThis bill misses an opportunity to improve USPS. In December 2018, the  President\u2019s  Task Force \non the United States Postal System provided recommendations to Congress to set a course for \nUSPS to operate under a sustainable business model, which would provide necessary mail  \nservices to citizens and businesses while competing fairly in commercial  markets. Although \nimplementing these recommendations is even more pressing today,  as  USPS proactively works  \nwith State election officials to prepare  for Election Day on November 3, 2020, this bill ignores  \nthem. Instead, it  would impose  burdensome new requirements  on USPS that would make it even  \nharder for USPS to deliver election mail.  Furthermore, this bill would create a private right of \naction against USPS for anyone claiming to have been harmed by its operational  reforms. If \nenacted, this provision would mark a radical shift in the legal framework governing USPS  \noperations and could subject the already heavily indebted agency to substantial litigation costs \nand risks. The trial  lawyers would benefit, while those who rely on USPS would suffer.   \nThis bill  is an overreaction to sensationalized media reports that have made evidence-free \naccusations that USPS has undertaken reforms to achieve political rather  than operational \nobjectives. USPS has not changed its service standards this year. And the reforms it has pursued \nhave been the continuation of  incremental  reforms  USPS has pursued  under the leadership of \nthree successive Postmaster Generals,  each of whom was selected by an independent  and \nbipartisan Board of Governors.  The Administration regrets that some have chosen to politicize \nrequired operational changes at USPS,  but it nevertheless appreciates Postmaster General Louis \nDeJoy\u2019s  commitment  to  delay these needed changes until after the election.  The broad \nprohibitions included  in H.R. 8015 would serve only  to further a false political narrative and \nintroduce additional constraints on the ability of USPS  to deliver  life-saving drugs, critical  \npackages, economic relief payments,  and election mail.     \n \nUSPS does not need a $25 billion bailout. It needs reforms that  will return it to a trend of  long-\nterm financial self-sufficiency. USPS  has stated that, under  current authorities,  it has sufficient \nfinancial liquidity to maintain operations until August 2021.  As of June 30, 2020, USPS is in a \nstrong cash position with almost $13 billion in reported cash on hand. Additionally, USPS \nrecently  announced an agreement in principle with the Treasury  regarding the terms for up to \n$10 billion in support authorized by the CARES  Act if needed to fund its operating expenses  due \nto the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a result,  there  is no reason to suspect that USPS, which handled \nan average of 2.7 billion pieces of mail per week  in 2019, will  have any difficulty handling mail  \nvolume associated with the 2020 election  unless Congress puts in place new requirements that \nmake this important work more difficult.    \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress on comprehensive legislation that  \nwill provide additional financial support to hardworking Americans who have been  most \nseverely affected  by the economic consequences of  the COVID-19  pandemic. This legislation \ncould  also include financial or operational flexibilities to help  USPS  continue to provide critical \nservices to the American people. H.R. 8015  takes the opposite approach, however,  and only adds \nto the significant challenges already facing USPS.  \n \nIf H.R. 8015 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  \n \n* * * * * * *   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nSeptember 9, 2019\n (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R.205 \u2013 Protecting and Securing Florida\u2019s Coastline Act of 2019 \n(Rep.

These bills would undermine the Administration\u2019s \ncommitment to a prosperous American economy supported by the responsible use of the Nation\u2019s \nabundant natural resources.  Development of our resources enhances our energy security and \nenergy dominance, and produces high-paying American jobs; provides increased revenue to the \nTreasury, States, tribes, and local communities; and is a critical source of conservation funding. \nH.R. 1146 would prohibit the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management from \nadministering an oil and gas leasing program in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge (ANWR) in Alaska. The bill would repeal a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of \n2017 that directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program for the development of the \nCoastal Plain that would allow the use of no more than about 0.01 percent of the total acreage of \nANWR for surface development of production and support facilities.  The Administration supports \nenvironmentally responsible energy development in the Coastal Plain, also known as the 1002 \nArea, of ANWR.  Such development is expected to increase America\u2019s energy security and \nindependence, create jobs, and provide affordable, reliable energy for consumers while providing \nmuch-needed revenue to both the State of Alaska and the Federal Government. \nSimilarly, H.R. 205 and H.R. 1941 would both restrict future oil and gas development in the \nFederal waters of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  H.R. 205 would amend the Gulf of \nMexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) to make permanent the current temporary leasing \nmoratorium on offshore leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the west coast of Florida.  H.R. \n1941 would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to permanently remove from \nconsideration acreage for offshore leasing on both the Atlantic and Pacific OCS.  Both of these \nbills would undermine OCSLA, which established a periodic, multi-stage planning process \ninvolving State and tribal consultation and a thoughtful comparison and balancing of the benefits \nand impacts to all the regions of the OCS.  These bills would permanently constrain this careful \nadministrative process.  Under the bills, large swaths of the OCS would be off limits for resource \ndevelopment without the benefit of periodic assessments of the potential economic, social, and \nenvironmental effects of development, as required by existing law.  Excluding these areas from  leasing consideration could place more pressure for development on other OCS areas and constrain \nour ability to meet national energy needs as required by OCSLA. \nAdditionally, each of these bills would eliminate the potential for future direct revenue that would \notherwise be provided to the Treasury, and through revenue sharing, to the States, tribes, and \ncounties where the development activities occur.  In Fiscal Year 2018, energy development on \nFederal and Indian lands and waters generated approximately $9 billion in direct revenue from \nroyalties, bonus bids, and rents.  Of that revenue, $1.78 billion was disbursed to 35 States.  The top \nStates receiving Fiscal Year 2018 revenues were New Mexico ($634.9 million); Wyoming ($563.9 \nmillion); Colorado ($112.5 million); Louisiana ($91 million); and Utah ($76 million). \nAdditionally, more than $1 billion was disbursed to Indian tribes and individual Indian mineral \nowners; $1.22 billion to the Reclamation Fund; $970 million to the Land and Water Conservation \nFund (LWCF); $150 million to the Historic Preservation Fund; and $3.5 billion to the general fund \nof the Treasury. \nProhibiting energy development in new Federal areas would hinder future administrations\u2019 efforts \nto make up for revenue lost as production declines from leases in aging energy fields.  Such \nrestrictions will tie the hands of future administrations and reduce their ability to enhance energy \nsecurity through strong domestic energy production and to ensure affordable energy for American \nfamilies. \nIf these bills were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he veto them. \n* * * * * * * \n2  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nOctober 23, 2019 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 4617 \u2013 Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy \n(SHIELD) Act \n(Rep.

In fact, the bill\u2019s \nexpansive definitions seem designed to instill a persistent fear among Americans engaged in \npolitical activity that any interactions they may have with a foreign national could put them in \nlegal jeopardy and jeopardize the political viability of the candidates or issues they support.  \nTitle I, Subtitle B purports to provide additional transparency to the public about who is \npurchasing political advertisements by imposing disclosure requirements on certain online \nplatforms.  For example, Subtitle B defines a \u201cqualified political advertisement\u201d to include \nmessages \u201crelating to any political matter of national importance, including . . . a national \nlegislative issue of public importance.\u201d  The term \u201cnational legislative issue of public \nimportance,\u201d however, is not defined.  Moreover, the bill includes a safe harbor that will exempt \nmany online platforms from disclosure obligations, which could ultimately produce less \ntransparency.  The safe harbor allows an online platform to avoid the transparency requirements \nif it independently makes the determination, using its \u201cbest efforts,\u201d that the request to purchase \nan advertisement was not subject to the statute\u2019s recordkeeping requirements.  The contours and \nscope of this extremely vague safe harbor, however, will likely be defined, if at all, through  regulations, creating a high likelihood that some platforms will be able to secure advantages over \ntheir competitors. \nThe Administration also opposes Title II of H.R. 4617, which purports to close \u201cloopholes\u201d \nrelated to foreign nationals\u2019 financial campaign contributions made online and to certain entities. \nIn reality, the conduct it addresses\u2014i.e., foreign nationals donating money to Super PACs or \nCorporate PACs\u2014is already prohibited. Foreign nationals are precluded from directing, \ncontrolling, and directly or indirectly participating in the decision-making process of any person, \nincluding a political committee, pertaining to any election-related activities. Moreover, foreign \nnationals cannot make contributions, donations, expenditures, or disbursements in connection \nwith any elections in the United States. \nFurthermore, Title II would require a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership to file \na certification that a foreign national was not involved in certain prohibited election activities \nwith the FEC before speaking.  This provision could have the effect of precluding certain \ncategories of speakers from commenting on events of national importance in the final days \nbefore a Federal election. \nWhile the Trump Administration seeks to limit foreign national interference in our elections by \nstrengthening FECA and combatting illegal behavior, the SHIELD Act would produce harmful \nunintended consequences without achieving that goal.  Accordingly, the Administration opposes \nH.R. 4617. \nIf H.R. 4617 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he veto it. \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \nMarch  5, 2019  \n(House  Rules)   \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION   OLICY \nH.R. 1 \u2013 For the People Act of 2019  \n(Rep.

H.R. 1 \nproposes an overreach of Federal power  that would violate constitutional principles of  separation \nof powers, federalism, and freedom of speech.  \nH.R. 1 proposes to have the Federal  Government micromanage elections  that are largely and  \nproperly within the purview of  the States themselves.   For example,  H.R. 1 would prohibit  \ncommonsense  efforts to clean up voting-rolls to limit opportunities for voting fraud.  The bill \nwould also require States to adopt online registration, same-day registration,  and automatic voter  \nregistration, thus imposing a one-size-fits-all standard for  weighing  the competing  values  of \nvoter access and voting integrity.  Furthermore,  H.R. 1 would enhance the powers of the Federal  \nElection Commission (FEC) Chairman and reduce the number of  FEC  members  from six to five, \nthus  increasing the chances that the FEC becomes  a partisan  entity with undue power to shape  \nand regulate  elections nationwide. \nIn addition, the  legislation further advances political redistricting mandates.   Specifically, the \nlegislation  would force States to create unelected  bodies and then delegate redistricting decisions  \nto them.  This would suppress  the voices of our Nation\u2019s citizens  and  cut off a nationwide debate \non how best to pursue fair and ethical  redistricting  processes throughout the country.  \nH.R. 1 also  chills free speech  by creating requirements  that would limit the  ability  of Americans  \nto participate in advocacy  without undue compliance costs and without  fear of public reprisals.   \nThe bill would establish costly and unnecessary programs  to finance political campaigns,  and \nforce  American taxpayers  to finance  Federal candidates they may not support.   \nFinally, the legislation would implement a number of well-intentioned but  misguided ethics  \nreforms for Government  officials.   Many of these reforms, such as  giving the Office of  \nGovernment Ethics (OGE) the authority to review and approve decisions throughout the  \nExecutive Branch and sheltering  its director from removal,  are inconsistent with the  \nconstitutional structure of the executive branch, and would effectively  restrict  the ability of the  \nexecutive branch to fully  function as well as its ability to hire and retain an experienced and  \nknowledgeable workforce.  \nIf H.R. 1 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he veto the bill. \n** * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nOctober 23, 2019 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS.J.

Shelby, R-AL) \nThe Administration supports passage of the Senate amendment to H.R. 268, sponsored by \nSenator Shelby, the End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act.  Most importantly, this \ncommonsense, compromise legislation addresses the immediate security and humanitarian crisis \nat our southern border.  It also provides legal certainty for hundreds of thousands of Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients, \nprovides additional disaster relief to impacted communities, immediately reopens the Federal \nGovernment and funds it through the remainder of fiscal year (FY) 2019, and sets the stage for \nbroader, permanent immigration reforms. \nTo physically secure our southern border, the bill includes $5.7 billion for a steel barrier system, \nincluding embedded investments in technology and roads, in the priority areas on the southern \nborder designated by professionals from the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection. \nIn addition, this legislation provides critical funding to address several other needs at our \nsouthern border, including: \n\u2022 $800 million in humanitarian assistance, medical support, and new temporary housing;\n\u2022 $805 million for technology, canines, and personnel to help stop the flow of illegal drugs,\nweapons, and other contraband;\n\u2022 $782 million to hire an additional 2,750 border agents, law enforcement officers, and\nstaff;\n\u2022 $4.2 billion for space to detain those who are apprehended entering the Nation illegally\nand who may pose a threat to the safety and security of our communities;\n\u2022 $563 million to support the immigration court system, including funding to hire 75 new\nimmigration judge teams to reduce the immigration court backlog of over 800,000 cases;\nand\n\u2022 a new system to allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home\ncountries, and reforms to promote family reunification for unaccompanied children.\nIn order to build the trust, goodwill, and bipartisan support necessary to begin real immigration \nreform, the Shelby Amendment provides three years of legislative relief for approximately \n700,000 DACA recipients brought to the United States unlawfully as children by their parents.  \nThis relief would prevent these DACA recipients from being deported and continue to allow  them access to work permits and Social Security numbers.  This legislation also provides a three-\nyear extension of TPS for the over 300,000 immigrants whose protected status is currently facing \nexpiration. \nIn addition, the Shelby Amendment provides appropriations for FY 2019 that would immediately \nreopen the Federal Government for the American people, and provides disaster relief to impacted \ncommunities.  While the Administration remains concerned with the overall discretionary \nfunding levels included in this bill, and with disaster spending that is unnecessary and premature, \nit supports this compromise approach as part of legislation that addresses the crises at the \nsouthern border.   \nIf the Shelby Amendment to H.R. 268 were presented to the President in its current form, his \nadvisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.  \n* * * * * * *\n2  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\n July 16, 2019\n (House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3494 \u2013 Damon Paul Nelson and Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Years 2018, 2019, and 2020 \n(Rep. Schiff, D-CA) \nThe Administration appreciates the continued work of the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence (Committee) to ensure the Intelligence Community (IC) has the necessary tools to \nprovide distinctive, timely insights that advance our national security, economic strength, and \ntechnological superiority.  Among other positive aspects, the bill would strengthen protections and \nexpand opportunities for IC personnel and extend authorities that secure the IC\u2019s supply chain and \nfacilities.  In particular, the Administration strongly supports the extension of the Intelligence \nIdentities Protection Act of 1982 to ensure covert intelligence officers are protected without regard \nto their assigned location.  The Administration also supports the proposed transfer of the National \nIntelligence University to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). \nThe Administration looks forward to reviewing the classified schedule of authorizations and \nworking with the Congress to address classified authorization levels.  Although the bill contains \nmany provisions that advance the mission of the IC, it also includes provisions of significant \nconcern, and we look forward to continuing to work with the Congress to address these concerns as \noutlined below. \nLimitations on determinations regarding certain security classifications.  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 2310 of the bill, which purports to preclude IC officers nominated for a \nposition requiring Senate confirmation from making certain classification decisions.  This \nprovision would unconstitutionally infringe on the President\u2019s control over national security \ninformation. \nIC Information Technology Environment (ITE).  The Administration objects to section 2312, \nwhich conflates the IC Information Environment with the IC Information Technology Enterprise \n(IC ITE), interferes with the intended purpose of the IC ITE, and risks reversing the gains achieved \nin establishing common platforms.  The provision treats the IC ITE construct itself as a major \nsystem deliverable with overly prescriptive testing and developmental requirements, and it would \ninflexibly require IC elements to use IC ITE, regardless of whether doing so in a given situation is \neither necessary or appropriate.  Further, the required business plan incorrectly assumes that all \nlegacy applications are compatible with IC ITE. \nUnfunded Requirements of the IC.  The Administration objects to section 304, which would \nrequire the DNI to brief the congressional intelligence and appropriations committees on programs  and activities not funded in the President\u2019s Budget.  This provision infringes on the President\u2019s \nprerogatives to define priorities as he sees fit. \nODNI Reporting Structure.  The Administration objects to sections 2404 and 2405, which would \nunnecessarily require two positions within ODNI, the IC Chief Financial Officer and IC Chief \nInformation Officer, to report directly to the DNI.  These two positions already serve statutory \nroles as the DNI\u2019s principal advisors within their areas of expertise.  As such, they already have \nand will continue to have direct access to the DNI and Principal Deputy DNI to execute their \nresponsibilities. \nReporting Requirements.  The Administration objects to certain reporting requirements in the bill.  \nThe bill contains over 50 new reporting and briefing requirements, including several that recur \nperiodically, which would exceed the IC\u2019s ability to respond in a timely manner and would require \nthe IC to shift limited resources away from executing its critical missions. Furthermore, the \nAdministration strongly objects to sections 308, 602, and 2718 to the extent they would require \nreporting of information about ongoing law enforcement investigations.  The extensive data \nreporting required by section 602 would, in particular, significantly strain the resources of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation.  The Administration also objects to section 702, which purports to \nrequire the production of deliberative executive branch information, and to section 2720, which \nwould affect the Vulnerabilities Equities Process.  In addition, sections 501, 502, and 503 should \nreflect the Committee\u2019s consultations with the Department of State. \nSecurity Clearance Reform.  The Administration appreciates support from the Committee for \nimproving the security clearance process; the Administration is concerned, however, that the \ncumulative amount of burdensome reporting and short deadlines included in title XXVI would \nslow down current reform initiatives.  In particular, the Administration objects to section 2604\u2019s \nestablishment of timelines for conducting security clearances, as the prescribed deadlines are not \nbased on empirical data and do not take into account the transformation activities already \nunderway to significantly streamline the clearance process.  The Administration looks forward to \ncontinuing to work with Congress to ensure appropriate performance measures are established as \nthe current reform initiatives are implemented. \nElection Matters.  The Administration has several concerns with certain aspects of the bill\u2019s \nelection-related provisions.  Section 2501 would require the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) to disclose sensitive information obtained through voluntary partnerships that may not have \nanticipated such disclosures.  Section 2503 would require the IC to conduct assessments of security \nvulnerabilities of State election systems, which is outside the scope of appropriate IC activities. \nSection 2505 is redundant of existing requirements.  And section 2506 would duplicate ongoing \nDHS information-sharing activities.  Moreover, the posture review required by section 2502 should \nbe updated, and DHS should take the lead with respect to the strategy required by section 2504, \ngiven its domestic focus.  The strategy should also be scoped to the threat rather than to specific \ncountries. \nPaid Parental Leave.  While the Administration supports paid parental leave, it has concerns with \nlimiting such a program to a select few Federal agencies.  The Administration looks forward to \n2  working with the Congress on proposals to provide parental leave to all families nationwide, \nincluding to all United States government employees, as set forth in the President\u2019s Budget. \nEstablishment of Energy Infrastructure Security Center.  The Administration has significant \nconcerns regarding section 2422, which would require the President to establish an Energy \nInfrastructure Security Center within the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence at the \nDepartment of Energy.  The proposed center would create a vast infrastructure that is not needed to \nappropriately evaluate or mitigate cyber threats to critical energy infrastructure.  The \nAdministration would instead continue to pursue ongoing initiatives to study, better understand, \nand improve mitigations that address the cybersecurity threat to critical infrastructure. \n3  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nJanuary 16, 2019 \n(House)  \nS A P  \nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 268 \u2014 Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2019 \n(Rep. Lowey, D-NY) \nThe Administration opposes H.R. 268, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2019, making \nsupplemental appropriations for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2019, and for other \npurposes.  While the Administration supports the provision of efficient and effective disaster \nrelief to impacted communities and agencies, it is concerned that the bill includes funding that is \nunnecessary, excessive, premature, and duplicative of other Federal funds. The Congress should \nnot use natural disasters as a pretext to engage in unnecessary spending outside of the agreed-\nupon discretionary spending caps. \nIn response to the numerous recent disasters that have hit States and territories, the \nAdministration acted swiftly to provide relief to those in need and begin the process of \nidentifying the resources required for long-term recovery.  The Federal Emergency Management \nAgency\u2019s (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF)\u2014a significant mechanism through which the \nFederal Government conducts response efforts for major disasters and emergencies\u2014has \nsufficient balances to address all immediate threats to life and property resulting from these \nrecent disasters.  The only supplemental appropriations the Administration is seeking at this time \nare those that would address the ongoing security and humanitarian crisis along the southern \nborder.   \nThe Administration also has a number of specific policy and funding concerns with the \nlegislation.  For instance, H.R. 268 includes $600 million in excessive and unnecessary funding \nfor Puerto Rico\u2019s Nutrition Assistance Program (NAP), $849 million in excessive Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) funding, and other line-item funding, which the Administration has not \nrequested, that is well in excess of the levels included in the disaster bill that passed in December \nof last year.  The bill also includes a number of policy changes that would waive or reduce cost \nsharing for State and local governments and other non-Federal entities, thus reducing a key \nincentive to limit excessive and unnecessary spending.  Finally, the bill makes unnecessary \nchanges to the Department of Agriculture\u2019s trade mitigation payments that would allow funds to \ngo to those with adjusted gross income (AGI) over $900,000.   \nIn addition, the Administration recognizes that there may be an effort to amend H.R. 268 with a \nmanager\u2019s amendment containing a continuing resolution through February 8, 2019.  As the \nAdministration has relayed in multiple Statements of Administration Policy since the beginning \nof the current lapse in appropriations, including such a continuing resolution without a broader \nagreement to address the border crisis is unacceptable.  If H.R. 268 were presented to the President with a continuing resolution included, his advisors \nwould recommend that he veto the bill.  \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nHouse Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill. \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) \nCrop and Livestock Losses.  The Administration does not support the $1.1 billion provided for \ncrop and livestock losses.  Existing USDA safety net programs, including crop insurance, can \nprovide this assistance to producers.  \nEmergency Forest Restoration.  The bill includes $480 million for restoration of storm-damaged \nforests.  This amount is excessive and unnecessarily increases Federal costs, therefore the \nAdministration does not support it. \nRural Development.  The Administration objects to the $150 million included in the bill for \nRural Development Housing, Water and Wastewater, and Community Facilities programs.  \nThese funds were not requested and duplicate program resources that are available through the \nannual budget process.  \nTrade Mitigation Payments.  The Administration does not support section 104, which would \nchange eligibility criteria for Market Facilitation Payments to allow producers with higher AGI \nto receive payments.  The existing eligibility criteria are consistent with other price and income \nsupport payments.    \nNutrition Assistance, Puerto Rico.  The bill provides $600 million for Puerto Rico\u2019s NAP.  This \nfunding is excessive and unnecessary.  USDA has been working closely with Puerto Rico to \ndevelop and implement a plan to return the NAP to normal operations after providing significant \nadditional resources immediately after the 2017 hurricanes.  There is no indication that \nhouseholds need ongoing support at this time or that Puerto Rico requires additional time to \nreturn to normal NAP operations. \nDepartment of Commerce \nEconomic Development Administration (EDA), Economic Development Assistance Programs.  \nThe Administration objects to the $600 million included in the bill for EDA\u2019s disaster recovery \ngrants, which is in addition to the $600 million in unrequested funding provided in the prior year.  \nEDA\u2019s disaster grant programs are duplicative of other disaster assistance programs, such as the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Community Development Block Grant \nDisaster Recovery.  \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Oceans and Coastal \nSecurity Fund Grants.  The Administration opposes the inclusion of $50 million for grants from \nthe National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund.  These grant funds, which support research on \nocean and coastal resources, are not necessary to address the immediate impacts of the disasters \n2  experienced last year.  \n \nNOAA, Fisheries Disaster Assistance.  The Administration objects to the $150 million included \nin the bill for fisheries disaster assistance.  This amount is excessive and not directly tied to the \nactual economic losses from declared disasters in 2018.   \n \nArmy Corps of Engineers \n \nConstruction of New Flood Risk Reduction Projects.  The Administration opposes emergency \nfunding for the construction of new projects.  The Army Corps has sufficient funding to address \nall priority repairs to existing infrastructure it has identified.  The construction of new projects or \nstudies to develop potential new projects to address the risks associated with future storms \nshould be considered on a national level to address the most significant risks to public safety as \nwell as the costs and benefits of potential investments.  Further, the Administration opposes \nwaiving upfront cost share requirements by non-Federal sponsors for the study or construction of \nnew projects which shifts these costs from beneficiaries of these projects to taxpayers.    \n \nDepartment of Energy \n \nOffice of Electricity.  The Administration does not support the $16 million provided in the bill \nfor the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Electricity to provide technical assistance related to \nrecently-declared disasters.  Technical assistance can be prioritized and executed as needed \nwithin available funding.  \n \nDepartment of Homeland Security \n \nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Assistance.  The Administration \nstrongly objects to language waiving non-Federal cost shares for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin \nIslands for Hurricanes Maria and Irma.  Cost shares are critical to ensure that work with \nimpacted jurisdictions is collaborative and that both partners have incentives to operate \nefficiently and control costs.  Further, the Administration is concerned with language that would \nwaive FEMA\u2019s pre-disaster condition limitation for certain disasters.  Removing the limitation \ncould cause FEMA to reimburse impacted jurisdictions for costs unrelated to disasters.   \n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency \n \nState Revolving Funds.  The Administration does not support the $849 million provided for the \nClean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs), as the funds are excessive and \ngo beyond core emergency response activities.  For example, $500 million is provided to the \nSRFs for areas impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria to support work exceeding \nnormal core response activities, including projects to address future flood damage risk and \nvulnerability.  In addition, the $349 million provided to the SRFs for projects to improve \ndrinking and clean water infrastructure impacted by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon \nYutu, and 2018 earthquakes and wildfires is excessive given the funding that FEMA is providing \nto bring those systems back into operation. \n \n3 \n  Department of Education \n \nEducation-Related Disaster Relief.  The Administration objects to the inclusion of $165 million \nfor education-related disaster relief as it is excessive and duplicative.  The $50 million approved \nby the prior Congress in H.R. 695 was sufficient to satisfy education-related needs associated \nwith recent disasters.  \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development \n \nCommunity Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR).  The Administration also \nopposes the inclusion of the unrequested and excessive $1.2 billion for CDBG-DR in 2018, \nwhich is in addition to the unrequested $1.7 billion that was appropriated for similar purposes in \nthe prior year. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure appropriate and \nsufficient funds are provided to respond to natural disasters. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n4 \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\n\t\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\n\t\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503\n\t\nFebruary 6, 2018        \n(House Rules) \nSTATEMENT OF  ADMINISTRATION POLICY \n \nHouse Amendment to H.R. 1892 \u2014 Further Extension of Continuing \n\nAppropriations Act, 2018\n\t \n(Rep.

As the \nAdministration has noted previously, the House-passed Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act is consistent with the President\u2019s pledge to undo the looming defense \nspending reductions that are  harmful to America\u2019s national security and military readiness. \nThe House-passed Department of Defense Appropriations Act incorporated in the bill includes \na total of $659 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD), including  $584 billion in base \nspending and $75 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.  These amounts are consistent \nwith a total funding level for DOD similar to that authorized by the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which was signed into law by the President.   It \nincludes $1.2 billion requested by the Administration to  support increased troop levels in \nAfghanistan, special operations forces capabilities, and other urgent needs. \nThe United States military\u2019s greatest asset is the men and women who volunteer to serve.  \nThis bill keeps faith with service members by providing a 2.4 percent military pay raise.  It \nincreases end strength across the military  services for active duty, reserve, and National \nGuard personnel, and includes funding for  training and maintenance to ensure that United \nStates troops are properly equipped and ready to fight. \nIn addition to supporting the defense bill, the Administration supports language in  the House \nAmendment to H.R. 1892 that provides for an extension of  a variety of healthcare \nprovisions, including Community Health Centers.  The Administration is also appreciative \nthat the bill includes language requested by the Administration to ensure continuity of \noperations for the 2020 Decennial Census Program and the Small Business Administration\u2019s \nDisaster Loans Program. \nThe Administration supports continuing discussions over a two-year budget agreement that \nensures funding for national defense and other priorities.  As those discussions continue, \nhowever, it is dangerous to hold defense funding for the current fiscal year hostage to arbitrary \ndemands for lower-priority domestic programs. \nIf the Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act,  2018, were presented to  the \nPresident in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. \n* * * * * * * ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n) \nJune 13, 2017 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 1094 \u2013 Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and\nWhistleblower Protection Act of 2017\n(Senator Rubio, R-FL, and 39 cosponsors)\nThe Administration supports S. 1094.

With over two million Americans expected to be addicted \nto opioids this year and over 300,000 deaths from overdoses involving opioids since 2000, the \nAdministration is committed to leveraging every available tool in its arsenal to combat the \nscourge of opioid misuse and provide needed relief to American families and patients.  In \nOctober of last year, the Administration declared a nationwide Public Health Emergency, and in \nMarch of this year, the President announced his groundbreaking Initiative to Stop Opioid Abuse \nand Reduce Drug Supply and Demand, which attacks the opioid crisis with a whole-of-\ngovernment approach.   \nAddressing the opioid crisis has been a top priority of the President since day one, and the \nAdministration welcomes legislation that complements its efforts to end the opioid crisis.  The \nAdministration strongly supports House passage of bipartisan bills to protect patients enrolled in \nMedicare and Medicaid, create targeted programs for at-risk populations, expand access to \nmedication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders, and provide resources for States and \ncommunities struggling to deal with the scale of the opioid crisis.   \nH.R. 5797, the Individuals in Medicaid Deserve Care that is Appropriate and Responsible in its \nExecution (IMD CARE) Act, would allow States to provide Medicaid services for individuals \nwith opioid use disorders in Institutions for Mental Diseases.  The Administration is already \nusing existing Medicaid 1115 demonstration authority to enable States to use Medicaid resources \nfor inpatient opioid abuse recovery services, and this bill would be consistent with this \nconstructive policy.  \nH.R. 6082, the Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act, may improve care for patients with  substance use disorders by updating information sharing to better align with existing HIPAA \nregulations.  Patients suffering or recovering from opioid addiction must access services from \ndoctors, treatment facilities, and hospitals across an increasingly complex healthcare \nsystem.  This bill would enhance coordinated care while protecting patient privacy.  The \nAdministration is supportive of this effort and looks forward to working with the Congress to \nensure that this bill does not have unintended effects. \nH.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment \n(SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, combines a number of bipartisan initiatives that \nwould improve Medicare and Medicaid and strengthen efforts to prevent and treat opioid abuse \nby patients enrolled in these health programs.  The bill\u2019s Medicaid changes would protect \nvulnerable youth, enhance monitoring to detect irresponsible and abusive opioid prescribing, and \nencourage States to increase coverage of treatment for substance use disorders.  H.R. 6 would \nalso enable Medicare to encourage the use of safe and effective alternatives to opioids for pain, \nscreen enrollees for opioid abuse, require secure prescribing of opioids to prevent diversion and \nmisuse, and facilitate coverage of medication-assisted treatment and telehealth services for \nopioid use disorders.  Finally, this bill would support the development of non-addictive opioid \nalternatives, provide grants to local public health laboratories that detect synthetic opioids, and \nexpand the ability of medical professionals to prescribe medications that help patients overcome \naddiction.  The Administration appreciates the Congress\u2019s efforts to prevent opioid overdose \ndeaths and looks forward to working to refine some parts of this bill, such as the proposed pilot \non testing drugs for adulterants. \nThese initiatives represent bold, evidence-based steps to prevent and treat opioid abuse, and will \nhelp save the lives of countless Americans.  The Administration commends the House on taking \nup these important bills and looks forward to working together to take all necessary steps to \ntackle the opioid crisis.  \nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5797, H.R. 6082, and H.R. 6, and looks \nforward to working with the Congress to address the opioid crisis as the legislative process \ncontinues. \n* * * * * * *   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nMarch 22, 2018 \n(House Floor) \nSTATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY \nH.R. 1625 \u2013 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018\n(Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ) \nThe Administration supports passage of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018.  In accordance with the spending levels set by \nthe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, the bill provides $1.3 trillion in discretionary funding for \nfiscal year (FY) 2018, including adjustments, with $695 billion for national defense and \n$600 billion for non-defense activities.  While the bill is far from perfect, it funds numerous \ncritical Administration priorities, including rebuilding the military, securing the border, \ncombatting the opioid crisis, promoting school safety, empowering American working families, \nand providing a robust investment in infrastructure. \nSince day one, the President and his Administration have been committed to ensuring the \nAmerican military remains the strongest in the world.  The bill supports an overall funding level \nof $665 billion for the Department of Defense, including $599 billion in base discretionary funds \nand $66 billion in Global War on Terror/Overseas Contingency Operations funds.  This \ntremendous investment in our Armed Forces includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for the troops, the \nlargest since 2010; $144 billion for new and upgraded platforms, weapons, and equipment, an \nincrease of over $20 billion from FY 2017; and funding for ongoing operations against the \nIslamic State of Iraq and Syria and other adversaries around the world.  Pursuant to the National \nDefense Strategy, these funds would ensure our military is postured to combat the full spectrum \nof threats we face today, invest in domains central to tomorrow's conflicts such as space and \ncyber, sustain American influence globally, and safeguard the free and open international order.  \nThe bill provides a down payment on the President's promise to secure our borders.  It provides \n$1.6 billion for physical barriers and associated technology along the Southwest border, funding \n110 miles of border wall system.  However, it fails to fund the highest priority areas identified by \nborder security professionals with decades of experience, areas where this investment is needed \nmost and will have the most significant impact.  It also increases funding for Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement by 10 percent.  The Administration is deeply disappointed in those \nMembers of Congress who recklessly set funding for detention beds below levels that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security deems necessary to detain illegal aliens and enforce our \nNation's laws.  Without reservation, the Administration will execute its immigration enforcement \nmission, using all available authorities and resources. \nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $4 billion in high priority investments to fund the \nPresident's Opioid Initiative and combat this growing crisis.  These resources will expand access  to prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. It also includes $330 million for \nDepartment of Justice grant programs that support drug courts, treatment, and law enforcement \nand community responses, $130 million for the Rural Communities Opioid Response program, \nand $386 million for opioid-related programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In \naddition, the bill prioritizes funding at the Department of Justice for the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration and the Organized Drug Enforcement Task Force for fighting drug addiction and \nthe opioid crisis. \n \nThe Administration appreciates that the bill provides robust funding levels for infrastructure.  \nThis includes $635 million in rural broadband, $500 million for rural water and wastewater \ngrants and loans, and $2 billion to repair and enhance VA medical facilities and State Veterans \nHomes. The bill also includes substantial increases for core infrastructure, such as highways, \nairports, railways, and waterways.  The Administration also appreciates that the Congress has \nchosen to channel a significant share of this increase to competitive, merit-based infrastructure \ngrant programs without providing an unfair advantage to certain projects. \n \nThe Administration is strongly supportive of both the STOP School Violence Act and the Fix \nNICS Act and appreciates their inclusion in the bill, along with other funding for critical public \nand school safety programs across the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, \nand Justice.  The bill includes additional resources to improve school safety, including $75 \nmillion to support the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative, full funding for mental health \nprograms authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act, and increased funding for research grants to \nimprove bullying prevention, counseling, gang enforcement, and training for school personnel.  \nThe bill also includes funding to improve the National Instant Criminal Background System \n(NICS), and to incentivize States to submit complete, accurate, and timely records.  \n \nThe bill helps American families secure better jobs by increasing funding for apprenticeships\u2014\nan effective earn and learn training approach\u2014by more than 50 percent.  The bill also provides \nsignificant new investments in child care, including nearly $2.4 billion in additional funding for \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant, which will help families access and afford the \ncare they need while they work, go to school, or enroll in job training. \n \nThe bill also advances the President's historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by providing resources for \nimplementation of the tax law, as well as addressing an unintended problem with section 199(A) \nthat created market distortions in farm country.  Further, the creation of a new wildfire \nsuppression cap adjustment and accompanying land management reforms will improve the \nFederal Government's ability to prevent and respond to wildfires.   \n \nThe Administration also commends the Congress for including the Taylor Force Act, which \nprohibits most U.S. foreign assistance that directly benefits the Palestinian Authority (PA) until \nthe PA ends the abhorrent practice of providing payments to terrorists and their families in \nreward for acts of violence. \n \nThe Administration is strongly supportive of the CLOUD Act, which empowers law enforcement \nto better protect the public from serious crime and terrorism and will improve international \ncomity. \n  A strong military and secure border are the centerpieces of the Administration's efforts to keep \nthe Nation safe.  H.R. 1625, the product of negotiation and compromise, includes wasteful \nspending increases in order to secure bipartisan support.  The funding it provides would advance \nour national security and support numerous other Administration priorities. \n \nIf H.R. 1625 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he sign the bill into law. \n \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nJune 27, 2017 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 3003 \u2013 No Sanctuary for Criminals Act \n(Rep.

These bills include H.R. 1628, the American Health \nCare Act of 2017, and the Senate amendment to H.R. 1628, the Better Care Reconciliation Act of \n2017.

This \nhistoric step accelerates the retrospective review process to make common-sense reforms to \nregulations across the Federal Government.  Legislation is helpful where it amends agencies' \nregulatory processes to ensure they are transparent, and appropriately balance costs and benefits.  \n \nEach of these bills would address different aspects of the regulatory process.

McCain, R-AZ) \nThe Administration appreciates the continued work by the Senate Armed Services Committee \n(Committee) on behalf of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in S. 1519, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. \nThe bill supports key Administration priorities including ending the defense sequester, rebuilding \nour military readiness, and modernizing our Armed Forces for the future.  It authorizes funding \nfor our ongoing efforts to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), to deter potential \nadversaries, and to bolster our allies.  The bill also includes substantial reforms to Department of \nDefense (DOD) management and business practices, and the Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Committee to continue finding efficiencies at DOD.  In particular, the \nAdministration is fully committed to DOD\u2019s full financial statement audit efforts starting in FY \n2018 and shares the Committee\u2019s goal of achieving a positive audit opinion over time.  The \nAdministration will work closely with the Committee on language that facilitates this effort.  The \nAdministration also appreciates the bill\u2019s inclusion of the 2010 Compact Review Agreement \nwith Palau and its related authorities.   \nThe bill authorizes $692.1 billion in total discretionary funding for FY 2018, consisting of \n$631.9 billion of base national defense funding ($36.7 billion above the President\u2019s FY 2018 \nBudget request) and $60.2 billion of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding ($4.4 \nbillion below the President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget request).  The previous Administration enacted \nharmful cuts to defense spending, and this Administration strongly supports eliminating them.  \nTo ensure that our military is not rebuilt on the backs of future generations of Americans, \nhowever, the Administration looks forward to enacting reductions to non-defense spending, \nincluding those proposed in its FY18 Budget. \nWhile the bill contains many promising reforms, it prohibits a new Base Realignment and \nClosure (BRAC) round, which would produce substantial recurring savings and allow DOD to \nalign infrastructure with force structure.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address its concerns, a number of \nwhich are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the \nclassified annex and working with the Congress to address its concerns about the bill provisions \nregarding classified programs. \n1 \n  \nProhibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure Round:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges Congress to provide BRAC \nauthorization, as requested, so that DOD can ensure it is not wasting resources on unneeded \ninfrastructure.  The Department estimates that a new BRAC round in 2021 would save an \nadditional $2 billion or more annually, resources which could be devoted to higher priorities \nsuch as readiness and modernization.  \n \nMixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility: The Administration strongly objects to \ncontinued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility as directed in \nsection 3112.  While the Administration appreciates the waiver authority to terminate the MOX \nproject provided to the Secretary of Energy, the project is unaffordable and risky.  The most \nrecent estimates, produced by the Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers, \nproject $12 billion in remaining costs and total construction costs of $17 billion.  In addition, the \nprojected operating costs are between $800 million and $1 billion per year for nearly two \ndecades.  The alternative, known as dilute and dispose, is a proven approach that is significantly \nless risky and expensive, and it can be implemented decades sooner than the MOX approach. \n \nTRICARE Benefit Reform:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of \nmeaningful TRICARE benefit reform proposals reflected in sections 706 and 707.  Section 706 \ninstitutes reasonable pharmacy co-pays that will retain TRICARE as one of the most generous \nhealth benefits available while also making it sustainable in the long term.  Section 707 \neliminates confusion and reduces administrative costs by creating one generous, consistent health \nbenefit that is equal for all members while making special accommodations for the most \nvulnerable populations, including medically retired members and their families and survivors of \nthose who died on active duty.  \n \nAuthority to Provide Assistance to Counter ISIS and to the Vetted Syrian Opposition:   The \nAdministration appreciates the expanded authority in sections 1231 and 1232 for small-scale \nconstruction of temporary facilities to meet operational needs and force protection requirements \nin both Iraq and Syria. The Administration objects, however, to language in section 1232 that \nrequires the Secretary to provide a 30-day notice to Congress on new initiatives.  This provision \nwill hamper DOD\u2019s ability to respond rapidly to opportunities on the battlefield.  \n \nModification of the President\u2019s Authority to Determine Alternative Pay Adjustment in Annual \nBasic Pay of Members of the Uniformed Services:  The Administration strongly objects to \nsection 604, which would place restrictions on the President\u2019s authority to set an alternative pay \nadjustment for members of the uniformed services.  This change would place more restrictions  \non the President\u2019s ability to set pay for members of the uniformed services than for the Federal \nworkforce.  Being able to adjust military compensation nimbly in response to serious economic \nconditions affecting the general welfare is not only essential to the Administration\u2019s \nresponsibility to recruit and retain a ready and capable uniformed services, but it is also required \nto balance military compensation costs against other investments critical to readiness, equipment, \nand modernization.  \n \n   \n2 \n  \nProvisions on the Organization and Structure of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD): \nThe Administration is concerned with sections 901, 902, 910, and 921, which would \nsignificantly reorganize DOD and its components.  In order to address those concerns, DOD \nhopes to work collaboratively with the Committee to better understand the justifications for these \nprovisions. In their current form, these sections seem to hinder DOD\u2019s ability to stabilize its \nsenior leadership team and manage the functions and capabilities needed to plan, execute, and \noversee national security policies, capability development, and operations.  Sections 901 and 902 \nwould alter DOD\u2019s planning and would require adjustments before DOD is able to implement \nchanges enacted last year.  The Administration is also concerned with the creation of additional \nExecutive Schedule Level II positions in OSD.  This reporting structure could complicate the \nrelationship between the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Defense.  In addition, \nsection 921 would eliminate each of the military department Assistant Secretaries charged with \nreal property, installation, and facility management.  Eliminating these three Assistant Secretary \npositions would jeopardize each military department Secretary\u2019s ability to comply with his or her \ntitle 10 responsibilities.  \n \nPersonnel Limitations:  The Administration strongly objects to section 912, which would modify \nthe definition of personnel in section 143(b) of title 10, United States Code, by adding the \ncontractor personnel counts against the statutory limitation of 3,767 for military, Government \ncivilian, and detailed personnel in OSD and the OSD direct support activities of the Washington \nHeadquarters Services. Management of the contractor personnel counts in OSD has been \naddressed through the funding ceiling imposed on all departmental headquarters by section \n346(b).  The Administration also strongly objects to section 931, which would further increase \nthe Senior Executive Service (SES) reduction set forth in the FY 2017 NDAA by an additional \n10 percent, because it would be detrimental to the overall DOD mission and, especially, the SES \nworkforce.  Requiring the Department to arbitrarily cut additional SES positions across-the-\nboard would have long-term negative effects or likely effects for various DOD services and \norganizations.  Any further reductions to SES positions in DOD should be made in a deliberate \nmanner following a review and analysis of the impact of such reductions on the functioning of \neach component or agency.   \n \nAdjustment to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) of Certain Members of the Uniformed \nServices:  The Administration objects to section 603, which would make a military member who \nis married to another military member ineligible for a BAH at the \u201cwith dependents\u201d rate.  This \nsection would inappropriately penalize military families in which both spouses have chosen to \nserve their country and, by providing a lesser compensation package than other members of \nequal grade, send a clear message that their service is not valued as highly.   \n \nAviation Bonuses:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 616 and 617, which would \neliminate DOD\u2019s current flexibilities and impair DOD\u2019s ability to manage the payment of \naviation bonuses for well-established reasons.  Sections 616 and 617 would harm DOD\u2019s ability \nto respond to current heavy recruiting by the civilian airline industry from the military pilot \ncommunity and would hamper DOD\u2019s ability to appropriately manage bonuses and to \ndifferentiate bonus levels for enlisted members who pilot remotely piloted aircraft.  \n \n3 \n  \nModification of Cost Limitation Baseline for CVN-78 Class Aircraft Carrier Program:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 125, which would limit the procurement cost for \naircraft carriers after CVN-79 to $12 billion.  The Administration shares the Committee\u2019s \nconcern with the cost of the CVN-78 Class Aircraft Carrier Program  and CVN-80 and beyond.  \nThe Navy\u2019s estimate for CVN-80, however, is $12.6 billion, not including class spares, which is \napproximately $900 million lower than CVN-79 in constant dollars.  Reducing procurement cost \nfor CVN-80 and follow-on ships to $12 billion cannot be achieved without a fundamental change \nin acquisition strategy (such as multi-year procurement or block-buy contracts that leverage \neconomies of scale) and continuous construction efficiencies, along with significant design \nmodifications that will reduce ship capability.  Stability in ship design and funding is the most \neffective way to achieve significant cost reductions.  \n \nDischarge in the Selected Reserve of the Commissioned Service Obligation of Military Service \nAcademy Graduates who Participate in Professional Athletics: The Administration strongly \nobjects to section 543, which would allow newly commissioned officers graduating from  the \nmilitary service academies, who obtain employment as professional athletes, to forego any active \nduty service and immediately serve in the Selected Reserve until the completion of their \ncommissioned service obligation.  The military service academies exist to develop future officers \nwho enhance the readiness and lethality of the military services.  Following graduation from  a \nmilitary service academy, individuals  should serve as full-fledged military officers, carrying out \nthe normal work and career expectations of an officer who has received the extraordinary \nbenefits of a taxpayer-funded military academy education.  \n \nTransfer of Lead of Guam Oversight Council (GOC) from the Deputy Secretary of Defense to \nthe Secretary of the Navy: The Administration strongly objects to section 951, which would \ntransfer lead of the GOC from  the Deputy Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of the Navy.  \nThe GOC oversees more than just Navy and Marine Corps activities and, when led by the \nDeputy Secretary of Defense, is able to balance international commitments against various \nService considerations in developing policy direction.  In addition to the realignment of Marine \nforces from  Okinawa to Guam, the GOC is monitoring U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s Commonwealth \nof the Northern Mariana Islands Joint Military Training proposal to develop live-fire ranges and \ntraining areas in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (the CNMI) (Tinian and \nPagan), and U.S. Air Force Divert and Exercise Airfield for up to 12 tankers on the CNMI.  The \ninteragency coordination necessary to complete required environmental analyses for these \ncomplex initiatives is most effectively accomplished with direct oversight by the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense. \n \nWorkforce Issues for Relocation of Marines to Guam:  The Administration appreciates the \ninclusion of section 1264, which would authorize the admission before December 31, 2023, of \nH-2B workers coming to Guam  to perform  certain military-related work under modified \nadmission requirements.  The Administration strongly urges Congress to adopt the \nAdministration\u2019s request, which would address specified needs in both Guam  and the CNMI.  \nThe Department of the Navy\u2019s current workload projections indicate that approximately 2,300 \nH-2B workers would be required to supplement the Guam or CNMI workforce on military build-\nup construction projects.  Without additional H-2B workers, limited access to construction \n4 \n  \nworkers would harm our ability to relocate Marines to Guam on planned timelines.  This could \nbe a factor in meeting the commitment of the United States to return land to Japan.   \n \nPolicy of the United States on Cyberspace, Cybersecurity, and Cyberwarfare:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 1621, which would establish United States policy for \ndeterring and responding to cyber-attacks or other malicious cyber-activities against United \nStates interests.  This section would enact certain foreign policy and military determinations that \nare traditionally within the purview of the President.  Development of such policy decisions must \nnecessarily take into account changing circumstances on a more rapid timeline than the proposed \nlegislative process would allow.  In particular, section 1621(f) would require the United States to \nnotify and encourage the governments of countries whose computer networks are being used by \nmalicious cyber actors to take action themselves to eliminate the threat, to the greatest extent \npracticable. This would severely constrain the President\u2019s decision space and undermine the \nability of the Armed Forces to act rapidly and decisively, in accordance with applicable law, to \nneutralize threats and to defend United States national interests in cyberspace.   \n \nReductions to Army Networking Programs: The Administration strongly objects to the severe \n  \nfunding reductions in sections 4101and 4201, and prohibitive language in sections 112 and 234, \nwhich would affect the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, Distributed Common Ground \nSystem-Army, and Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense programs.  These limitations would \ncripple the Army\u2019s efforts to provide commanders with a unified communications network while \nworking on a solution to  fill a critical capability gap regarding on-the-move communications.  \nThese constraints also would hamper the ability to provide reliable intelligence analysis down to \nthe battalion level and to ensure that integrated sensors and weapons support current and future \nAir and Missile Defense systems.  At this stage of development, limitations of this magnitude \nwould delay delivery of critical capabilities to our soldiers by at least two years.   \n \nDevelopment of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Range Ground-Launched Missile \nSystem:  The Administration objects to section 1635, which would establish a program of record \nto develop a road-mobile, ground-launched missile system  and would prohibit any authorization \nof funds for research and development until a detailed analysis of systems is delivered to defense \ncommittees.  The Administration is currently developing an integrated diplomatic, military, and \neconomic response strategy to maximize pressure on Russia.  It is also evaluating those military \ncapabilities that are needed to protect our national security.  This provision unhelpfully ties the \nAdministration to a specific type of missile system and funding requirements, which would limit \npotential military response options.  The Administration would support broad authorization of \nresearch and development on missile systems, including those prohibited by the treaty, to \ndetermine candidate systems that could become programs of record. \n \nCounter Unmanned Aerial Systems:  The Administration is disappointed that its proposal on \nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is not included in the bill.   For multiple economic and \nnational security reasons, the Administration supports the safe and secure integration of UAS \ninto the national airspace, but that requires the development of a legal framework that protects \nthe public from  those who would misuse this technology, such as recklessly flying near major \nairports, intentionally conducting surveillance, or facilitating attacks.  Under current law, the \nGovernment is unable to fully evaluate or use essential detection, tracking, and mitigation \n5 \n  \ntechnologies to counter these rapidly advancing threats.  The proposal would provide a tailored \ngrant of authority within a framework for effective oversight and protections of privacy, civil \nliberties, and airspace safety. \nNext National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) West (N2W) Campus:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to the Committee\u2019s decision to reduce N2W by $331 million \nthrough an incremental funding approach and recommends that funding be provided at the \nPresident\u2019s FY 2018 Budget request level.  The Administration objects to this type of \nincremental funding for military construction projects because  it undermines program stability \nand cost discipline and could negatively impact other mission-critical priorities.  In the case of \nthis project, the NGA expects to obligate the full amount of the budget request in FY 2018.  \nNavy Shipbuilding:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for Navy \nshipbuilding; the Administration, however, objects to the authorization of funding for only one \nLittoral Combat Ship, one fewer than the Administration requested, as well as the authorization \nof partial funding for an additional amphibious ship LX(R).  In addition, the Administration \nstrongly objects to section 124, which provides permanent incremental funding authority for the \nprocurement of the LX(R) ship class or the amphibious transport dock ship (LPD-30) \nclass. Incremental funding undermines program stability and cost discipline.   \n \nMissile Defense:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for missile defense; \nthe Administration, however, regards section 1653 as premature given that the Ballistic Missile \nDefense Review (BMDR) is still underway.  The provision would require the Secretary of \nDefense to deploy up to 14 additional ground-based interceptors (GBIs), store up to 14 GBIs, \nand complete any required supporting construction at Fort Greely, Alaska, no later than \nDecember 31, 2021.  After the BMDR is completed, the Administration will provide \nrecommendations on how best to strengthen our Nation\u2019s missile defense. \n \nExercise on Assessing Cybersecurity Support to Election Systems of States:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 1630, which would require DOD to exercise for a mission inconsistent \nwith its statutory authority, as well as with democratic norms  on the role of the military in \nAmerican political affairs.  The Department of Homeland Security is the Federal lead for critical \ninfrastructure, including electoral infrastructure.  In addition, section 1630 would direct the \nSecretary of Defense to intrude on the authority of State Governors to determine how to use their \nown State National Guard forces to carry out a State cybersecurity mission to protect State \nelection systems. \n \nTRICARE Advantage Demonstration Program:  The Administration objects to section 701, \nwhich would require the Secretary of Defense to establish a demonstration program to contract \nwith and automatically enroll TRICARE beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage plans.  Automatic \nenrollment of beneficiaries eligible for both Medicare and TRICARE into a Medicare Advantage \nplan is undesirable and unworkable.  In addition, there is existing demonstration project authority \nunder both Medicare and TRICARE to evaluate any appropriate collaborative initiatives. \n \nForeign Military Sales:  The Administration objects to section 1283, which would require the \nDefense Security Cooperation Agency to consult with United States commercial entities before \n6 \n  \ndelivering a formal pricing and availability response to a foreign customer.  Section 1283 would \nsignificantly delay responses to a partner\u2019s request for price and availability data, and also could \nresult in the United States not being able to respond in time for an international competition.  \nMandating such procedures would be inconsistent with existing federal procurement rules, could \nnegatively affect open competition in the acquisition process,  and slow it to the point of resulting \nin loss of sales.  \n \nSpecial Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF):  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nwillingness to revise changes made to the SDAF in the FY 2017 NDAA.  The Administration \nobjects, however, to section 1281 because it would preclude using available funding in the SDAF \naccount to purchase defense articles and services other than precision guided munitions.  The \nSDAF is a revolving fund and the available funding obligational authority amount fluctuates \nthroughout the year.  By mandating that 20 percent of the available obligation authority be used \nto purchase precision guided munitions every year, the Administration will not have sufficient \nfunding available to purchase any other defense articles or services that will likely be urgently \nneeded by our friends and allies, including those participating in coalition operations that directly \nsupport our national interests.  SDAF is an important security cooperation authority, as it makes \nthe United States more responsive to the military needs of our international partners, and \nenhances readiness of our Armed Forces by reducing the need to divert assets from  them to \nsupport urgent foreign requirements. \n \nDefense Export Licensing:  The Administration supports the goals in section 867 to use flexible \ncomprehensive defense export authorizations, including for large international cooperation \ndefense programs, but emphasizes that the Secretary of State already has the authority to \nundertake this effort.  Since enactment of the Arms Exports Control Act (AECA) in 1976, the \nSecretary of State has had exclusive responsibility for defense sales and defense exports, \nincluding defense export licensing.  Over the years, the State Department has always worked \nclosely with its key partner agency, DOD, on these issues.  Therefore, no additional authority is \nneeded, and such authority could cause confusion.  Should this section be retained, the authority \nshould be vested in the Secretary of State so as to minimize overlapping, duplicative statutory \nauthorities and frameworks.  Further, the Administration objects to the mandate in subsection \n(b), since the longstanding practice is to permit industry to select which of the available licensing \nauthorizations it wishes to use, and restricting this practice would likely create unnecessary \nregulatory burdens. \nDOD Support for Corporate Activities and Charitable Organizations:  The Administration \nrecognizes the value of United States charitable organizations and notes the existing mechanisms  \nthrough which DOD supports State and United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID)-led reconstruction, development, and stabilization efforts globally, including foreign \ndisaster relief and humanitarian assistance.  The Administration has not, however, assessed \nwhether support to a particular organization, as outlined in section 1083, may be undertaken \nconsistent with any other relevant law concerning the provision of non-reimbursable assistance \nsuch as military personnel and the use of DOD facilities and other assets by such organizations.  \nThe Administration is also concerned about the implications of having a private entity receive \npreferential support from DOD in security cooperation or operational efforts.  Such preferential \ntreatment would cause confusion among existing networks of non-governmental organizations \n7 \n  \nsupported by State and USAID in these programmatic areas regarding the recognized need for \nmaintaining a distinction between military and civilian missions, actors, and activities in \nproviding humanitarian assistance.  The Administration also believes that section 1082, which \nfacilitates foreign assistance, should be subject to foreign policy direction of the Secretary of \nState, with input from  USAID.  Section 1083 also appears premature, insofar as section 1082 \ndirects the DOD to review its collaboration with charitable organizations.  Therefore, the \nAdministration objects to section 1083 pending further interagency coordination and internal \nDOD analysis. \nDefense Industrial Base: The Administration strongly objects to section 863, which would \nsunset certain procurement requirements related to sourcing goods exclusively from  the national \ntechnology and industrial base.  The existing procurement requirements act as a key guarantor of \nstrategic supply chain security.  They protect DOD\u2019s ability to reliably source goods such as \nchemical weapons antidotes and components for naval vessels, among others.   \n \nExpanding Competition:  The Administration objects to the breadth of section 811, which would \ngrant waiver authority to the Secretary of Defense in expanding competition for DOD contracts \nwhere there is only one responsible bidder.  In cases where only one bidder exists, DOD already \npossesses the necessary capabilities to ensure proper quality and quantity of procured goods, as \nwell as the reasonableness of prices.  This waiver authority, if used to override current Buy \nAmerican laws, would result in further losses of existing American capabilities and jeopardize \nAmerican jobs.  To avoid unintended consequences, the Administration urges Congress to \nnarrow the authority by authorizing its exercise only on a case-by-case basis approved by the \nSecretary and by exempting certain laws from waiver, including, at a minimum, those that \nimpose domestic source  restrictions.  \n \nSimplified Acquisition Threshold:  The Administration supports the increase in the simplified \nacquisition threshold (SAT) that would be provided by section 812, but objects to expansion of \nthe waiver to the Berry Amendment and Specialty Metals requirements whose thresholds are tied \nto the SAT and would automatically increase if the SAT is raised.  These provisions provide vital \nprotections for American manufacturing and American jobs.  For this reason, the Administration \nurges Congress to maintain the current threshold for applicability of the Berry Amendment and \nSpecialty Metals requirements.  This would enable agencies and contractors to enjoy the benefits \nof simpler and less costly transactions made possible by an increase in the SAT without erosion \nof critical domestic source protections.     \n \nWearable Electronics:  The Administration objects to section 817, which would repeal domestic \nsource restrictions related to wearable electronics.  The Berry Amendment has protected \nAmerican manufacturing and American jobs since its enactment in 1941.  Wearable electronics \nare an emerging industry in the United States, and this legislation should not hamstring \nAmerican capabilities in this young field by allowing it to be opened up for foreign bidding.  The \nsection also should provide a definition of \u201cwearable electronics.\u201d  Congress should also \nconsider whether less intrusive means, such as the availability subsection already encompassed \nin subsection (c) of the Berry Amendment, are sufficient for the acquisition of wearable \nelectronics. \n \n8 \n  \nBerry Amendment Exceptions:  The Administration objects to section 865, which would create \nexceptions to the Berry Amendment under memoranda of agreement with foreign governments. \nOpening up the end-item  market to foreign competitors could collapse upstream industries in the \nUnited States such as weaving, cloth-making, cotton growing, sheep herding, and many others.  \nIt is important to defend the Berry Amendment, which supports American jobs and protects \nAmerican supply chains. \n \nCivilian Workforce Provisions:  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee did not \ninclude the Administration\u2019s proposals to provide for key workforce flexibilities to improve, \nexpand, and harmonize the Federal Government\u2019s efforts to restructure and reshape the Federal \nworkforce.  Many of the proposals enacted in the FY 2017 NDAA, and the Administration\u2019s \nproposals seek to expand those flexibilities across the Federal Government so that the benefits \nand impacts of the flexibilities they provide can be used across the Federal civilian workforce.  \nThe proposals aim  to improve the speed and precision with which the Government can hire \ntemporary, term, and student employees; expand access to qualified talent; improve the \nattractiveness and utility of buyouts as a workforce reshaping tool; and allow for a broader \nexchange of ideas and talent between the Government and the private sector through industry \nexchange authority.  We highly encourage Congress to include the Administration\u2019s five \nproposals because all Federal agencies would greatly benefit from these workforce flexibilities as \nthey seek to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability to the American taxpayer.  \n \nProcurement Standardization:  The Administration urges inclusion of the Administration\u2019s \nproposals to expand to civilian agencies the procurement provisions applied to DOD by the last \nCongress to standardize basic acquisition procedures and flexibilities across the Federal \nGovernment.  Consistent treatment of issues, including task order protests and use of purchase \ncards, will reduce unintended costs and complications associated with bifurcated acquisition \nprocesses. \n \nConstitutional Concerns:  Certain provisions in this bill raise  constitutional concerns.  These \ninclude, for example, section 1242, which would interfere with the President\u2019s exclusive \nauthority to recognize foreign nations; section 1265 and 1653, which would interfere with the \nPresident\u2019s authority to command the armed forces; and section 1241, which would interfere \nwith the President\u2019s authorities to conduct diplomacy and command the armed forces.  Section \n901(e) would contravene the Appointments Clause by authorizing an incumbent official to serve \nin a new office without further appointment.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns. \n* * * * * * \n \n \n9 \n ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nJuly 24, 2018 \n(Senate) \nS A P  \nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nSubstitute Amendment to H.R. 6147 \u2014 Interior, Environment, Financial Services, and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Act, 2019 \n(Sen. Shelby, R-AL) \nThis Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) provides views on the Substitute Amendment to \nH.R. 6147, making appropriations for Interior, Environment, Financial Services and General \nGovernment, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, Transportation, \nHousing, and Urban Development for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2019.   \nThis legislation includes important investments in our Nation\u2019s farmers, natural resources, \nGovernment operations, national infrastructure, and financial sector.  The legislation supports \nimplementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; provides funding for infrastructure \nthrough the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, Department of Transportation \nGeneral Fund, the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act credit program, and State \nRevolving Funds; supports responsible development of our Nation\u2019s energy resources through \nthe Department of the Interior; addresses the National Park Service\u2019s maintenance backlog; and \nfully funds wildland fire management needs.  The Administration also welcomes the Senate\u2019s \ntimely consideration of appropriations legislation, and looks forward to working with the \nCongress well before the end of the fiscal year to enact individual bills that provide sufficient \nfunding to essential programs without further jeopardizing the Nation\u2019s fiscal state. \nThe Administration is concerned, however, that this combined package is nearly $38 billion \nabove the FY 2019 Budget request, includes certain objectionable policy provisions, and \nexcludes important Administration policy priorities.  Division D exceeds the Administration\u2019s \nrequest by $23.5 billion, division A exceeds the Administration\u2019s non-Defense request by \n$7.6 billion, and division C exceeds the Administration\u2019s request by $6.3 billion.  The \nAdministration recognizes that the problematic spending levels in the bills composing this \npackage stem from the non-Defense discretionary cap set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 \n(BBA), about which the Administration has repeatedly registered concern in multiple Statements \nof Administration Policy and other communications to the Congress since the BBA\u2019s enactment.  \nIn the FY 2019 Budget request, this SAP, and publicly available letters to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee expressing views on each division of this bill, the Administration has \nidentified numerous reductions and reforms that, if adopted, would bring these bills in alignment \nwith the President\u2019s policies.  The Administration hopes the Congress will consider these \nsuggestions and engage with the Administration to ensure that funding is eventually enacted for \nthe truly essential programs supported by these bills.  As the appropriations process continues, \nthe Administration would like to work with the Congress to identify a path to ultimately enacting \nnon-Defense discretionary spending for FY 2019 below the BBA cap of $597 billion.    \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nSenate Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill. \n \nDivision A \u2013 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2019  \n \nDepartment of the Interior (DOI) \n \nDOI Topline.  The Administration appreciates the support for priority DOI programs, but is \nconcerned that the bill also provides funding in excess of the FY 2019 Budget request for a \nnumber of DOI programs.  In total, the bill provides an estimated $13.1 billion for DOI, or \n$2.4 billion more than the FY 2019 Budget request. \n \nEnergy Development.  The Administration applauds the Committee\u2019s commitment to energy \ndevelopment on public lands and in offshore waters, including additional resources for the \nBureau of Land Management, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and Bureau of Safety and \nEnvironmental Enforcement.  \n \nNational Park Service (NPS) Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nstrong support for NPS construction, and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress \nto address the NPS deferred maintenance backlog. \n \nOffice of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) Closure.  The Administration is \ndisappointed that the bill does not support the FY 2019 Budget request to begin the process of \nclosing ONHIR, which is on pace to complete relocation activities that began 44 years ago.  It is \ntime to start an orderly transition, which has bipartisan support, by transferring land management \nfunctions to DOI.  \n \nDOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service \n \nWildland Fire Management.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s $4.3 billion investment in \nwildland fire operations, fully funding the 10-year average for wildland fire suppression costs for \nboth USDA\u2019s Forest Service and DOI.  The Administration also appreciates the additional \n$900 million for suppression operations, $724 million for the Forest Service and $176 million for \nDOI, to cover suppression costs above the 10-year average, which would help in the year before \nwildfire cap adjustment funds become available. \n \nFederal Land Acquisition.  The Administration opposes funding provided in the bill for land \nacquisition, which is $172 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Departments \ncurrently manage roughly 700 million acres and have a deferred maintenance infrastructure \nbacklog of over $16 billion.  Acquiring new lands, however, is a low priority. \n \nUSDA, Forest Service \n \nUSDA, Forest Service Topline.  The Administration is concerned that funding for non-fire \nprograms is nearly $900 million above the FY 2019 Budget request, with large increases for \n2 \n  facilities and roads, and for State and Private Forestry grants. \n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n \nEPA Topline.  The Administration is concerned that the bill would provide $8.8 billion for EPA, \nwhich is $2.7 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request, and includes funding for programs that \nare outside of the Agency\u2019s core responsibilities. \n \nFunding for Water Infrastructure.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s attention to \ncritical water infrastructure needs through the robust funding provided to both the State \nRevolving Funds and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act credit program.  \nCombined, this funding could support several billion dollars in total water infrastructure \ninvestment for a wide variety of needs.   \n \nSuperfund.  The Administration appreciates the $1.1 billion included in the bill for the Hazardous \nSubstance Superfund account, which would support infrastructure projects and ongoing cleanup \nof contaminated sites that are impacting the health and economic well-being of communities. \n \nEPA Geographic Programs.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides $418 million \nabove the FY 2019 Budget request for the Geographic Programs, which perform local ecosystem \nprotection activities, much of which is more appropriately funded by State and local entities. \n \nCategorical Grants.  The Administration continues to recommend reductions to Categorical \nGrants, which the bill would fund at $496 million above the FY 2019 Budget request. \nReductions to these grants would reduce Federal funding for State activities that go beyond \nstatutory mandates, and would encourage a rebalancing of environmental program funding \nbetween Federal and State resources. \n \nEPA\u2019s Science and Technology Account.  The Administration continues to advocate for \nreductions in the Science and Technology account, which is funded at $706 million or \n$283 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  This account includes programs in research \nand development that are not necessary to implement core EPA responsibilities. \n \nDiesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) Grant Program.  The bill provides $50 million, or \n$40 million above the FY 2019 Budget request for the DERA grant program.  While the \nAdministration supports limited DERA funding for targeted high-priority projects, DERA \nprojects overlap with other Federal and State programs, and have diminishing returns for older \nvehicles that would eventually be replaced regardless of DERA grant funding levels.  States may \nalso be able to use some of a $2.7 billion fund established through a settlement with Volkswagen \nto support very similar projects to those normally funded by the DERA program.  \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nNational Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and \nthe Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (Wilson Center).  The Administration is \ndisappointed that the bill does not eliminate Federal funding for NEA, NEH, and Wilson Center.  \n3 \n  The Administration recognizes the positive effects the arts and humanities have on our \ncommunities; however, the FY 2019 Budget request proposed an orderly phase-out of Federal \nfunding for these agencies, as the Administration does not consider their activities to be core \nFederal responsibilities.  \n \nDivision B \u2013 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019  \n \nDepartment of the Treasury \n \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS).  The bill provides the IRS a total of $11.3 billion, $128 million \nabove the FY 2019 Budget request.  This amount includes $77 million in dedicated funding for \ntax reform implementation.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for tax \nreform and the amounts provided in the bill fully fund the Administration\u2019s two-year proposal \nrequested in FY 2018. \n \nOffice of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).  The bill provides TFI a total of \n$159 million, equal to the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support for TFI to continue its critical work safeguarding the financial system from \nabuse and combatting other national security threats using non-kinetic economic tools. \n \nTreasury Departmental Offices.  The bill provides $209 million for Treasury\u2019s Departmental \nOffices, $7 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  These additional funds could be used to \nstrengthen review of foreign investment in the United States and address other emerging \npriorities.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to provide adequate \nresources to support anticipated increases in the caseload for review by the Committee on \nForeign Investment in the United States.  \n \nBureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP).  The bill includes a provision that would allow BEP to \nacquire land and construct a replacement for its currency production facility in the National \nCapital Region using its existing resources.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nsupport for this proposal which would allow BEP to avoid a costly renovation of its current \nfacility and ultimately lower the operating costs of producing the Nation\u2019s paper currency. \n \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The bill provides $250 million, \n$236 million above the FY 2019 Budget request, for the CDFI Fund.  The Federal Government \nshould not be allocating taxpayer funds to the mature CDFI industry, which should have ready \naccess to private capital.  The requested amount is sufficient to support ongoing CDFI Fund \nactivities, including the New Markets Tax Credit and the zero-subsidy Bond Guarantee Program. \n \nExecutive Office of the President (EOP) \n \nWhile the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for EOP, including an increase \nfor the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the bill does not adequately fund the \nInformation Technology Oversight and Reform (ITOR) account.  To maintain the OMB Office \nof the Federal Chief Information Officer\u2019s (OFCIO) ability to perform statutorily required IT \noversight, policy development, and IT security functions and the U.S. Digital Service\u2019s ability to \n4 \n  respond effectively to significant security breaches or recover failed systems, the Administration \nurges the Congress to fund ITOR at the level requested in the FY 2019 Budget and to support \nthe requested funding necessary to transition certain OFCIO activities to the GSA Office of \nGovernment-wide Policy.  The Administration shares the Committee\u2019s goal of ensuring that the \nOffice of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has sufficient resources to execute its \nduties, but is concerned that $2 million of OMB\u2019s appropriation is directed to OIRA in a way \nthat is inconsistent with OMB\u2019s staffing plan for FY 2019 and impinges on the President\u2019s \nability to prioritize the work of his staff. \n \nGeneral Services Administration (GSA) \n \nFederal Buildings Fund.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of the \nDepartment of Transportation Headquarters purchase and priority renovation projects, and \nencourages the Congress to fully fund the Federal Buildings Fund at the anticipated level of \nagency rent collections.  \n \nFederal Capital Revolving Fund.  The Administration continues to support the establishment of a \nFederal Capital Revolving Fund (FCRF), a new budgetary mechanism for large civilian real \nproperty projects.  The Administration recently transmitted legislative language and looks \nforward to working with the Congress to enact the FCRF proposal.  \n \nFederal Information Technology (IT) Modernization.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s prior attention to modernizing vulnerable and inefficient legacy IT systems with \ninitial funding provided to the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) in FY 2018, and urges \ncontinued support for the TMF in FY 2019 as a means of addressing these pressing challenges.  \nThe bill provides no funding for the TMF, which would halt the Technology Modernization \nBoard's ongoing work to tackle impactful, Government-wide IT modernization efforts.  The \nAdministration believes that any additional funding would be well-utilized and will continue \nworking with the Congress to demonstrate the taxpayer value generated by the TMF. \n \nEnvironmental Review Improvement Fund.  The Administration is pleased that the Committee \nfully funds the FY 2019 Budget request for the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering \nCouncil, allowing the Council to create a more standardized, coordinated, and predictable \npermitting process that protects public health, safety, and the environment. \n \nWorkforce Fund.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact \nauthorizing legislation to establish the President\u2019s Management Council Workforce Fund and \nurges the Congress to provide appropriations upon its enactment.  The Administration believes it \nis essential to develop and fund innovative solutions aimed at recruiting, retaining, and \nrewarding high-performing Federal employees and those with critical skills sets. \n \nFederal Civil Service \n \nPay Adjustment.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides an across-the-board pay \nincrease for Federal employees in calendar year 2019.  Across-the-board pay increases have \nlong-term fixed costs, yet fail to address existing pay disparities, or target mission critical \n5 \n  recruitment and retention goals.  As proposed in the Administration\u2019s request for a Workforce \nFund, the Administration continues to support performance-based pay that is strategically \naligned toward recruiting, retaining, and retraining high performers and those in mission-critical \nareas. \n \nSmall Business Administration (SBA) \n \nSBA Disaster Loans Program Account.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides \nno funding for SBA disaster loan administrative expenses, assuming instead that SBA will rely \non balances from appropriations provided in the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations \nfor Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-123, division B, subdivision 1).  \nThese balances are necessary to administer loans to those affected by the major hurricanes that \noccurred in 2017, and may not be sufficient to allow SBA to continue to provide loans to \ndisasters occurring in FY 2019.  The Administration believes it makes sense both fiscally and \nprogrammatically to provide funds through the regular appropriations process and ensure that \nSBA will have the necessary resources to quickly assist homeowners and businesses in disaster \nrecovery.  \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The bill provides $282 million for the CFTC, \nconsistent with the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nsupport, which would bolster the CFTC\u2019s examination and analysis capabilities and help to \naddress financial technology innovation.  The Administration also proposed legislation \nauthorizing user fees to fund certain CFTC activities, in line with nearly all other Federal \nfinancial and banking regulators.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt this proposal. \n \nDivision C \u2013Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, 2019  \n \nDepartment of Agriculture \n \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Topline.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support for select priority programs, but is concerned that the bill also provides \nfunding well in excess of the FY 2019 Budget request.  In total, the bill provides an estimated \n$20.3 billion for USDA programs funded in the bill, approximately $6.5 billion more than the \nFY 2019 Budget request.  In addition, the Administration is also disappointed that the bill \nincludes unrequested funding for the Economic Research Service, Foreign Agricultural Service, \nthe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Agricultural Marketing Service. \n \nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  The bill \nprovides $6.1 billion for WIC and includes a $400 million rescission of unobligated balances.  \nThe Administration appreciates the funding level for the WIC program.  This level is sufficient \nto serve all projected eligible participants. \n \n6 \n  Competitive Research Grants.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides \n$405 million for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s \npremier competitive research program.  \n \nNational Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides \nfunding for the transfer of facility operations from the Department of Homeland Security to \nUSDA, but requests that the special hiring authority provided in the bill include a salary cap. \n \nRural Business-Cooperative Service.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides \n$105 million for grants and loan programs for the Rural Business-Cooperative Service.  The \nFY 2019 Budget request proposes to eliminate these programs as they are duplicative of other \nFederal funding and have not been successful in improving economic outcomes in rural areas. \n \nRural Broadband Pilot Program.  Advancing broadband deployment in unserved rural areas is a \npriority of the Administration.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 recently provided \n$600 million for this purpose, and USDA is actively implementing the program in conjunction \nwith the private sector.  An additional $425 million as provided in the bill for the same purpose \nas the $600 million the Congress already provided is premature at this time. \n \nForeign Agricultural Service.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides \n$210 million in funding for the McGovern Dole International Food for Education program, \nwhich was proposed for elimination in the FY 2018 and FY 2019 Budget requests.  McGovern-\nDole has unaddressed oversight and performance monitoring challenges and is duplicative of \nU.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs. \n \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) \n \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Administration appreciates additional funding \nprovided in the bill to support the FDA\u2019s Oncology Center of Excellence, modernize the generic \ndrug development review process, and advance drug development for rare diseases as requested in \nthe FY 2019 Budget.   \n \nOther Agencies \n \nP.L. 480 Title II Food Aid (Title II).  The Administration opposes providing food aid funding \nthrough use of Title II and prefers that all food aid be provided through the International Disaster \nAssistance account within USAID.  While the United States is the world\u2019s largest donor of food \naid, taxpayers expect such aid to be provided in the most cost-effective manner possible.  \nUnfortunately, Title II is cost-inefficient, slow, and limits USAID\u2019s ability to use the most \nappropriate food aid intervention for a particular crisis. \n \nDivision D \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2019  \n \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) \n \nInfrastructure Investments.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s strong support for \n7 \n  improving the Nation\u2019s infrastructure, consistent with the Administration\u2019s infrastructure \npriorities.  The bill provides $57 billion in highway, highway safety, and transit formula funds, \nequal to the authorized fourth year of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST \nAct).  In addition, the Administration appreciates the additional $4.8 billion in General Fund \nbudget authority provided for highway, transit, and airport formula programs.  The \nAdministration urges the Congress, however, to support the principles of the Infrastructure \nInitiative, which seek a more modern approach to investing in the Nation\u2019s infrastructure, by \nstrengthening partnerships between the Federal Government and non-Federal stakeholders, \nencouraging more non-Federal leadership, and removing barriers to allow non-Federal parties to \nmove forward with projects that they deem priorities.  The Administration believes the bill could \ndo more to promote these principles and would like to work with the Congress to include \nprovisions that support these goals.  \nObjectionable Competitive Grant Spending.  The Administration opposes the excessive spending \nthe bill allocates to a number of competitive grant programs.  These programs disproportionately \nallocate funds to projects in States and regions that have the financial wherewithal to provide \nmore support to projects that benefit those areas.  Accordingly, the Administration does not \nsupport the bill\u2019s funding levels for: \nCapital Investment Grants (CIG).  The bill provides $2.6 billion, $1.6 billion above the FY 2019 \nBudget request for CIG, which proposed to wind down the CIG program by not entering into any \nadditional grant agreements.  The Administration notes that the bill does not contain any \nauthorizing language directing how projects should be evaluated as they move through the CIG \nstatutory process, and the Administration would oppose any effort to insert such language in a \nfinal bill. \nRail Grant Programs.  The bill provides $565 million for three discretionary grant programs \nadministered by the Federal Railroad Administration, which were not requested in the FY 2019 \nBudget.  The Administration does not support funding for these programs, which can be \naddressed with private sector, State, and local support.  In particular, the State of Good Repair \nprogram is unnecessary as the main beneficiary of the program\u2014the Northeast Corridor \n(NEC)\u2014runs through some of the wealthiest states in the Nation that have the resources to \ninvest in the NEC if they so choose.  \nThe Administration appreciates that the bill includes no funding for the Gateway projects, about \nwhich it continues to have significant concerns. \nEssential Air Service (EAS).  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee did not \ninclude the Administration\u2019s proposals to reform the EAS program.  The EAS program is in dire \nneed of reform, as total EAS spending has increased 600 percent since 1996, and its per-\npassenger subsidy costs are $238 on average, with a high of $778 per passenger.  The \nAdministration\u2019s reform proposals would bring spiraling costs under control while ensuring that \ntruly remote communities receive air service.  \nAmtrak.  The Administration believes that there are real opportunities to make Amtrak a more \nefficient passenger rail provider, and is encouraged by the performance of Amtrak executive \n8  leadership in identifying efficiencies.  The Administration encourages the Congress to support \nthese efforts.  The bill would continue the status quo, unfortunately, providing Amtrak funding \nequal to the FY 2018 enacted level for all its operations, including its highly inefficient long-\ndistance trains. \n \nBUILD Grants.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the National \nInfrastructure Investments (\u201cBUILD Grants\u201d) program, the Administration believes that overly \nprescriptive project selection requirements, such as the bill\u2019s requirement to award projects based \nsolely on the selection criteria from the 2016 Notice of Funding Opportunity, dilute the DOT\u2019s \nability to select the most meritorious grantees and would be particularly harmful and unfair to \nrural communities.  \n \nPipeline and Hazardous Materials. The Administration objects to language in the bill that would \nreduce the operational expenses of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration \n(PHMSA) by $100,000 per day if a certain hazardous materials regulation is not completed \nwithin 45 days of enactment.  Such a provision will degrade the ability of PHMSA to carry out \nits mission of ensuring the safety of pipelines and the transport of hazardous materials.  \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nRental Assistance Programs.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides \n$42.9 billion for HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs, which is $7.1 billion above the FY 2019 \nBudget request and does not reflect requested legislative reforms.  In April 2018, the \nAdministration released its Making Affordable Housing Work Act, which would give assisted \nfamilies a simpler and more transparent set of rent structures to reduce administrative burden, \nincentivize work, and place HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs on a more fiscally sustainable \npath. \n \nProposed Grant Eliminations.  The Administration urges the Congress to eliminate the \nCommunity Development Block Grant (CDBG), the HOME Investment Partnerships program, \nand the Choice Neighborhoods program, as proposed by the FY 2019 Budget request. The \nCDBG program is not well-targeted to the most distressed areas and has not demonstrated a \nmeasurable impact on communities.  The Administration also believes that State and local \ngovernments are better positioned to comprehensively address community revitalization needs as \nwell as the unique local market challenges and impediments that lead to housing affordability \nproblems.  In total, these eliminations would save $4.8 billion in FY 2019, which could be \ndirected to higher priority needs. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  Some provisions would contravene \nthe separation of powers between the executive branch and the Congress.  In particular, certain \nprovisions\u2014including one purporting to bar OMB from expending funds to alter the annual \nwork plan of the Army Corps of Engineers\u2014would interfere with the President\u2019s supervision of \nthe executive branch.  Others would require congressional committee approval of certain \nExecutive actions, in violation of INS v. Chadha, or could infringe on the President\u2019s \nconstitutional authority to control the disclosure of information that is subject to Executive \n9 \n  privilege.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these \nconcerns. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2019 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n10 \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nJune 27, 2017\n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 3004 \u2013 Kate\u2019s Law \n(Rep.

This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize \nregional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for \nactivities on public lands.  The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located \nmostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy \nand mineral development.  Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes \nthe rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities\u2019 interests and could \npotentially dilute their input in planning decisions. \n \nH.J.

This rule establishes \nrequirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have \nan accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student \nsuccess, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student \nprogress.  While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local \ncontrol of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas \nwhere the ESSA intended broad flexibility.

The \nAdministration, however, has concerns about the legislation\u2019s revisions to the Stafford Act, \nwhich would force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal land and other disasters \nalready covered by the Stafford Act, including hurricanes. \nWildland Fire Management Funding \nLast year, Federal wildfire suppression spending reached $2.9 billion, an amount that signals \nclearly the need for Congress to address the rising cost of fire suppression operations.  The \ndependence on \u201cfire borrowing\u201d to cover funding shortfalls in times of severe wildfire impedes \nthe missions of our land management agencies, including by taking critical funding from \nprograms that help reduce the risk of catastrophic fire, restore and maintain healthy functioning \necosystems, and yield timber production. \nThe Administration, however, has concerns with re-purposing the Stafford Act to address \nwildfires.  The purpose of the Stafford Act is to assist State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) \ngovernments that become overwhelmed when responding to and recovering from natural \ndisasters affecting their jurisdictions.  H.R. 2936 would modify the Stafford Act by creating a \nnew type of disaster declaration to address the cost of wildfire suppression on Federal land, \nthereby changing long-standing principles governing Federal support to SLTT governments.  As \nwe have seen in this year\u2019s historic Atlantic hurricane season, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (FEMA) must continue to be focused on its existing mission, and the \nStafford Act\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund must remain dedicated solely to that mission.   Instead of the approach outlined in H.R. 2936, the Administration supports a separate, annual cap \nadjustment for wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns about the sufficiency \nof funds for wildfire suppression and avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds. \nImproving Forest Management  \n \nThe Administration appreciates H.R. 2936\u2019s recognition that fixing the funding component of \nfire borrowing will not, on its own, stop the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires.  \nMeaningful forest management reforms to strengthen our ability to restore the Nation\u2019s forests \nand improve their resilience to destructive wildfires must be a part of any permanent solution.  \nH.R. 2936\u2019s provisions that expedite environmental approval for proactive forest management, \nincluding hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire timber salvage and reforestation actions, are \nimportant steps forward.  The Administration supports and will continue to work with Congress \non the details of the forest management reform proposals.  \n\u00a0\nAlthough the Administration has concerns with H.R. 2936\u2019s modifications to the Stafford Act, \nthe Administration will continue working with Congress to enact a sustainable solution to \u201cfire \nborrowing\u201d that does not adversely affect FEMA\u2019s critical disaster relief funding and that \nrecognizes the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of wildfires.  \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nDecember 6, 2017 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.J.

Frelinghuysen, R-NJ) \nThe Administration appreciates investments that H.R. 6157, making appropriations for \nthe Department of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2019, and for \nother purposes, makes in the Nation\u2019s military readiness and lethality. \nThe Administration welcomes the House\u2019s timely consideration of appropriations legislation, \nand looks forward to working with the Congress well before the end of the fiscal year to enact \nindividual bills that provide sufficient funding to essential programs without further jeopardizing \nthe Nation\u2019s fiscal state. \nThe FY 2019 Budget request, as amended, accounts for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 \n(BBA\u2019s) new Defense and non-Defense discretionary spending caps for FY 2019.  The \nAdministration strongly supports the overall Defense levels included in the BBA.  Given the \nNation\u2019s long-term fiscal constraints and the need to right-size the Federal Government, \nhowever, the Administration does not support the BBA\u2019s non-Defense cap of $597 billion, which \nis $57 billion above the FY 2019 Budget.  \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nHouse Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill. \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) \nMilitary Personnel and End Strength.  The U.S. military\u2019s greatest asset is the men and women \nwho volunteer to serve.  The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the requested 2.6 \npercent military pay raise as well as the FY 2019 Budget request to rebuild the military by \nincreasing end strength to 1,338,100 Active Component and 817,700 Reserve Component \nmembers.  \nLittoral Combat Ship.  The Administration urges the Congress to limit the funding level to $647 \nmillion in FY 2019 to procure only one Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).  There is no requirement for \nan additional two LCSs in FY 2019 at a cost of $950 million.  One LCS in FY 2019, when \ncombined with the three LCSs funded in FY 2018 and the three funded in FY 2017, would keep \nboth shipyards supplied with ample work to remain viable for the U.S. Navy Next Generation \nFrigate FFG(X) Program competition.  It is imperative that we take the lessons learned from the \nLCS program and move on to providing a more capable and survivable ship to meet the Navy\u2019s  needs, consistent with National Defense Strategy (NDS) priorities. \nJoint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Recapitalization.  The Administration \nstrongly believes the JSTARS recapitalization program does not meet the needs of the warfighter \nacross the full spectrum of conflict and investing in the Advanced Battle Management System \n(ABMS) is prudent and better postures DOD for future warfighting environments.  DOD is \nmoving away from its previous aircraft-centric approach to JSTARS recapitalization and urges \nthe Congress to support DOD\u2019s new, more survivable, net-centric approach.  The old, aircraft-\ncentric JSTARS recapitalization program will be unable to perform its mission in high-end \ncontested environments, which is counter to the NDS.  Therefore, the Administration objects to \nthe addition of $623 million to fund that program, and to making the divestment of current \nJSTARS aircraft contingent on its funding.  In order to address sensing and command-and-\ncontrol requirements across the full range of military operations, resources would be better \nutilized to invest in ABMS.    \nReductions to Operations and Maintenance Accounts.  The Administration appreciates the \nfunding the Committee provided to restore readiness in FY 2019, which supports the NDS to \nbuild a more lethal force.  The Administration strongly objects, however, to the $3 billion \nreduction to the Services\u2019 Operation and Maintenance (O&M) accounts.  These reductions \nnegate the Committee\u2019s otherwise clear intent to support defense readiness, and would directly \nand negatively impact key readiness priorities including depot maintenance, base operations \nsupport, communications, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization.  The \nreductions to Defense-wide O&M would negatively impact readiness enablers supporting the \nmilitary services and the Defense Health Program\u2019s medical services for service members and \ntheir families.  Consistent with the NDS objective to reform DOD business practices, the \nFY 2019 Budget request already contains reductions in the O&M account of over $450 million \nfor prior-year underperformance; these funds were realigned to support other NDS priorities. \nFinancial Assistance for Palau.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s ongoing \nsupport for the 2010 Palau Compact Review Agreement (CRA), which enables the United States \nto fulfill its financial commitment to the Republic of Palau in FY 2018.  Consistent with the \nCRA, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to include DOD\u2019s requested provision in \nFY 2019 that would provide the authority for DOD to offset costs associated with Palau\u2019s \nacquisition of private land for new U.S. defense sites to install critical defense assets.  \nMultiple Munitions Reductions.  The Administration appreciates the overall support for preferred \nmunitions provided in the bill, which directly supports the NDS to build a more lethal force.  \nThe Administration objects, however, to the bill\u2019s nearly $245 million in reductions to munitions \nacross multiple procurement appropriations.  The FY 2019 Budget request continues increased \nprocurement of preferred and advanced munitions, a necessity due to ongoing operations in the \nMiddle East and the need for war reserves.  DOD still has shortfalls in preferred munitions \nneeded to achieve successfully the operational plans identified in the NDS; the AIM 120 \nAdvanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Army Tactical Missile System \n(ATACMS), Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), Joint Air-to-Ground Missile \n(JAGM), and the Tomahawk missile are all significant contributors to increasing DOD\u2019s \nlethality and warfighting capability that would be detrimentally impacted by these reductions. \n2  C-135B (Open Skies Treaty Aircraft).  The Administration objects to the elimination of\n$222 million in procurement funding for the C-135B.  The Air Force requires the full funding\nlevel requested in the FY 2019 Budget to recapitalize its existing fleet of 1960s-era OC-135B\nU.S. Open Skies Treaty (OST) observation aircraft with modern, capable, and cost-effective\nreplacements.  Currently, the United States is not able to fully exercise its rights under OST\nbecause some airfields covered by OST are not accessible to the current OC-135B aircraft.\nReporting Requirements Related to Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI).  The \nacceleration of cloud technologies is critical to developing technologies such as artificial \nintelligence and machine learning.  In order to maintain our military advantage, DOD will \nresponsibly leverage foundational infrastructure and platform technologies from the commercial \nsector.  The Administration recognizes the importance of proper congressional oversight and \nappreciates the Committee\u2019s interest in and support for these efforts, but is concerned that \nlanguage in section 8130 of the bill is overly prescriptive and creates a burdensome reporting \nrequirement.  DOD is committed to continuing to work with the Congress to address \nconcerns and enable oversight while balancing the requirement to deliver new capabilities to the \nwarfighter.  \nIsraeli Cooperative Programs.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the \nFY 2019 Budget request of $500 million for Israeli Cooperative Programs, consistent with the \nU.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding.\nConstitutional Concerns \nCertain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns, including with respect to the \nPresident\u2019s authority as Commander in Chief.  The Administration looks forward to working \nwith the Congress to address these concerns. \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2019 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n* * * * * * *\n3  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\n      May 21, 2018 \n          (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nS. 2155 \u2013 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act \n(Sen. Crapo, R-ID, and 26 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration supports House passage of S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory \nRelief, and Consumer  Protection Act.  The bill is consistent with the Administration\u2019s core \nprinciples for regulating the United States financial system set forth in Executive Order 13772.  \nSpecifically, the bill would advance the principles of:  (1) fostering economic growth; (2) \nmaking regulation efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored; and (3) empowering \nAmericans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the marketplace. \nS. 2155 builds on the legislative foundation established by a series of bills passed by the House \nof Representatives with strong, bipartisan support, including H.R. 389, the Credit Union \nResidential Loan Parity Act; H.R. 1699, Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act; H.R. \n2133, the CLEARR Act; H.R. 2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act; H.R. 2255, \nthe Housing Opportunities Made Easier Act; H.R. 2683, the Protecting Veterans Credit Act; and \nH.R. 3221, Securing Access to Affordable Mortgages Act.  The bill also includes a variety of \nprovisions from bipartisan Senate bills, including S. 223, the Senior$afe Act of 2017; S. 1002, \nthe CLEAR Relief Act; S. 1139, the Main Street Regulatory Fairness Act; S. 1310, the Home \nMortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act; S. 1753, the SAFE Transitional License Act; and S. 1751, \nthe Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act.  \nS. 2155 contains commonsense reforms that will improve consumer access to credit, tailor \nregulations to better fit our diverse financial system, and provide enhanced protections to \nconsumers and veterans.  It reforms regulations governing mortgage lending to facilitate prudent \nlending by community banks and credit unions to prospective homebuyers.  It also helps \nnonprofit organizations such as Habitat for Humanity continue their missions of expanding \nhomeownership by allowing them to accept donated appraisal services.  \nS. 2155 streamlines regulations for credit unions and community and regional banks, reducing \nunnecessary regulatory costs and making it easier for them to serve their customers without \ncreating risks to the financial system.  Although the Administration prefers a risk-based approach \nto systemic risk regulation, S. 2155 provides a reasonable alternative in raising from $50 billion \nto $250 billion the threshold for the application of enhanced prudential standards to bank holding \ncompanies by the Federal Reserve.  The new threshold, along with the bill\u2019s other supervisory \nreforms, will further tailor regulation to the nature of the risks presented by different institutions \nand help allocate more regulatory resources toward the institutions that present the greatest risks \nto the financial system.  Further, these provisions are an important step in addressing the  Administration\u2019s concerns that excessive regulation provides a competitive advantage for the \nlargest institutions and fosters excessive concentration in the banking industry.  The  \nAdministration notes that Federal banking agencies retain their authority to address any risks to \nsafety and soundness that may emerge with institutions that fall below the new threshold.  The \nAdministration also notes that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has the \nauthority to increase risk-based deposit insurance premiums to address new risks, if any, arising \nfrom the threshold to ensure that there are no net costs to the FDIC.  \n  \nThe Administration is committed to consumer protection and ensuring that consumers have the \ntools needed to manage their finances in the manner that best suits their own personal needs and \nfinancial goals.  Accordingly, the Administration supports section 301 of the bill that gives \nconsumers the ability to place security freezes on their credit files with credits bureaus.  This \nprovision will empower consumers to protect their credit in the event of future data breaches or \nincidents of identity theft.  The Administration further supports the bill\u2019s enhanced protections \nfor our Nation\u2019s veterans with respect to the excluding of certain medical debt from consumer \nreport information.    \n  \nThe net impact of this legislation will be to foster economic growth by expanding prudent \nlending, reducing regulatory costs, and strengthening the ability of consumers to protect their \ncredit records, while ensuring the proper oversight and regulation of the financial system.   \n \nThe Administration is grateful to Senator Mike Crapo, Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and Congressman Jeb Hensarling, Chairman of the House \nFinancial Services Committee, for their tireless work on this legislation to improve the regulation \nof community banks and credit unions, protect our financial system, and create the conditions for \nrobust economic growth. \n  \nIf S. 2155 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend he \nsign the bill into law.  \n  \n* * * * * * *  \n   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n) \nMarch 21, 2017\n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 372 - Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017\n(Rep.

Shelby, R-AL) \nThis Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) provides views on the Substitute Amendment to \nH.R. 6157, making appropriations for the Departments of Defense (DOD), Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, \n2019. \nThis legislation includes important investments in the Nation\u2019s military readiness and lethality.  \nDivision A, which makes appropriations for DOD, fully funds the Administration\u2019s requested \n2.6 percent pay raise for United States troops.  The Administration appreciates the funding in this \nbill to support execution of the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy, as well \nas the Nuclear Posture Review, South Asia Strategy, and vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific \nregion.  The Administration also welcomes the Senate\u2019s timely consideration of appropriations \nlegislation, and looks forward to working with the Congress well before the end of the fiscal year \nto enact individual bills that provide sufficient funding to essential programs without further \njeopardizing the Nation\u2019s fiscal state. \nDivision B invests in the health, education, and job skills of the American people.  The \nAdministration appreciates the inclusion of funding for priorities such as anti-opioid programs, \ncharter schools, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, and apprenticeship grants, as well \nas the bill\u2019s support for efforts to combat improper payments and maintain program integrity.  \nHowever, the bill does not include \u2013 and in some case precludes \u2013 numerous Administration \nproposals to reduce spending and improve program effectiveness found in the FY 2019 Budget\u2019s \nMajor Savings and Reform volume.  \nThe Administration appreciates that division A is generally consistent with the FY 2019 Budget \nrequest topline level.  Division B, however, exceeds the Administration\u2019s request by \n$11.8 billion.  The Administration recognizes that the problematic spending levels in division B \nstem from the non-Defense discretionary cap set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), \nabout which the Administration has repeatedly registered concern in multiple SAPs and other \ncommunications to the Congress since the BBA\u2019s enactment.  \nIn the FY 2019 Budget request, this SAP, and publicly available letters to the Senate \nAppropriations Committee expressing views on each division of this bill, the Administration has \nidentified numerous reductions and reforms that, if adopted, would bring these bills into \nalignment with the President\u2019s policies.  The Administration hopes that the Congress will \nconsider these suggestions and engage with the Administration to ensure that funding is  eventually enacted for the truly essential programs supported by these bills.  As the \nappropriations process continues, the Administration would like to work with the Congress to \nidentify a path to ultimately enacting non-Defense discretionary spending for FY 2019 below the \nBBA cap of $597 billion.  \n \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nSenate Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill. \n \nDivision A \u2013 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019 \n \nMilitary Pay Raise.  The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the FY 2019 Budget \nrequest for a 2.6 percent military pay raise. \n \nStrategic Forces.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s robust support for the 2018 \nNuclear Posture Review and the FY 2019 Budget request for operations, sustainment, and \nrecapitalization of U.S. strategic nuclear forces.  \n \nGround Combat Investments.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s robust support of \nArmy and Marine Corps ground investments.  The bill provides $12.5 billion, including Armored \nBrigade Combat Teams and amphibious ground combat systems, which provide critical support \nin furtherance of National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy (NDS) objectives. \n \nIsraeli Cooperative Programs.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the \nFY 2019 Budget request of $500 million for Israeli Cooperative Programs, consistent with the \nU.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding.  \n  \nFinancial Assistance for Palau.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s ongoing \nsupport for the 2010 Palau Compact Review Agreement (CRA), which has enabled the United \nStates to fulfill its financial commitment to the Republic of Palau in FY 2018.  Consistent with \nthe CRA, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to include the provision requested in \nthe FY 2019 Budget that would provide the authority for DOD to offset costs associated with \nPalau\u2019s acquisition of private land for new U.S. defense sites to install critical defense assets. \n  \nLittoral Combat Ships (LCS).  The Administration strongly objects to the provision of an \nadditional $475 million above the FY 2019 Budget request for the procurement of a second LCS.  \nThe additional ship is not needed.  One LCS in FY 2019, when combined with the three funded \nin FY 2018, would keep both shipyards supplied with enough work to remain viable for the \nFrigate competition.  It is imperative that, based on lessons learned from the LCS program, a \nmore capable and survivable ship is developed to meet the Navy\u2019s needs, consistent with NDS \npriorities. \n \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle.  The Administration strongly objects to the elimination of \n$209 million in launch funding for the Space Test Program-4 mission.  The Robotic Servicing of \nGeosynchronous Satellites payload is an innovative public-private partnership to demonstrate on-\norbit repair, refueling, and other servicing capabilities.  This satellite will be available for launch \nin spring 2021, which requires the procurement of its launch vehicle in FY 2019.  Failure to do \n2 \n  so would lead to significantly increased program costs for satellite storage and program support, \nand puts at risk substantial private investment and future public-private partnerships.  \n \nAfghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF).  The Administration objects to the $532 million \nreduction to the ASFF.  With the President\u2019s South Asia Strategy at a critical juncture, this \nreduction would jeopardize the ability of the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces \nto maintain a security environment that supports upcoming parliamentary and presidential \nelections and achieve political reconciliation with the Taliban. Reduced funding specifically risks \nundermining:  1) the combat effectiveness of the Afghan National Army; 2) the ability of the \nAfghan National Police to effectively implement the Kabul Enhanced Security Zone; 3) the \ncontinued modernization of the Afghan Air Force; and 4) the continued expansion of the Afghan \nSpecial Security Forces. \n \nCounter-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria Train and Equip Fund (CTEF).  The Administration \nobjects to the FY 2019 CTEF reduction of $406 million.  This reduction would inhibit DOD\u2019s \nability to ensure a lasting and complete defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), \nexecuted as part of DOD\u2019s by, with, and through strategy.  The primary defeat mechanism in the \nfight against ISIS are U.S. partner forces in Iraq and Syria.  Fully equipping and training these \npartner forces is critical to maintain campaign momentum against ISIS and its threat \nnetworks.  If funding is reduced to the level in the bill, DOD would be significantly degraded in \nits ability to:  1) complete the materiel provisioning of the border guard forces to secure the \nwestern border of Iraq; 2) provide the necessary mobility and lethal equipment sets for local \nsecurity forces to strengthen the security of liberated provinces; 3) build the capability of \nPeshmerga to conduct wide area security; 4) support the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service with \nthe necessary modern equipment to sustain the pressure on ISIS threat networks; 5) resource \nemerging requirements to support Syrian Democratic Forces offensive operations against \nremaining ISIS forces; and 6) support building the capacity of internal security forces to stabilize \na post-ISIS Syria and prevent an ISIS reemergence. \n \nSecurity Cooperation Funding.  The Administration objects to the $150 million reduction to the \nsecurity cooperation Overseas Contingency Operations request.  Funding security cooperation at \na level below the FY 2019 Budget request would force the cancellation or delay of critical \nsecurity cooperation programs supporting the NDS line of effort to strengthen alliances and \nattract new partners. \n \nDefense Information Systems Agency\u2019s National Background Investigation System (NBIS).  The \nAdministration objects to the bill\u2019s $60 million reduction to NBIS, which would undermine the \nAdministration\u2019s efforts to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal background \ninvestigation process.  The reduction would delay NBIS\u2019s deployment from FY 2019 to \nFY 2020, and undercut DOD\u2019s efforts to assume the National Background Investigation Bureau \nmission.  The reduction would also limit DOD\u2019s ability to integrate capabilities that are critical to \nreducing the background investigation backlog, such as continuous evaluation, biometrics and \nfingerprinting, automated records checks, and case management. \n \nEnd Strength.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the request to increase end \nstrength to 1,338,100 Active Component and 817,700 Reserve Component members.  One of the \n3 \n  primary objectives of the FY 2019 Budget request, which fully aligns with the National Defense \nStrategy, is to invest in DOD\u2019s most important asset: people.  Failure to fund the necessary end \nstrength growth could impose critical delays on efforts to improve readiness by increasing \nmanning levels to reduce personnel and operational tempo, as well as to generate expanded \nability for full-spectrum training opportunities. \n \nDivision B \u2013 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 \n \nDepartment of Labor \n \nApprenticeship.  The Administration strongly supports the continued funding for the Department \nof Labor\u2019s apprenticeship grant program.  These grants would help to expand the use of \napprenticeship as a tool for cultivating a skilled workforce in businesses across the Nation.  The \nbill maintains language, however, preventing the Department from spending funds to provide a \nstreamlined, employer-driven approach to establishing high-quality apprenticeship programs. \n \nReemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments (RESEA).  The Administration strongly \nsupports the bill\u2019s funding for RESEA in accordance with the BBA.  RESEA is an evidence-\nbased intervention that reduces improper payments in the Unemployment Insurance program \nwhile getting claimants back to work more quickly and at higher wages. \n \nProtecting Union Members.  The Administration strongly objects to the lack of increased \nfunding for the Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS).  The increase is necessary to \nrestore OLMS\u2019s investigative workforce, which the previous administration allowed to fall by \none-third during the past 10 years.  The FY 2019 Budget request strengthens protections for \ntransparency for union members by supporting more audits and investigations to uncover flawed \nofficer elections, fraud, and embezzlement. \n \nInternational Labor Affairs Bureau (ILAB).  The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s \ncontinued funding for ILAB\u2019s grants, which the FY 2019 Budget request proposed to eliminate.  \nMany of ILAB\u2019s grants are awarded non-competitively and spent on activities that are of \nquestionable utility and where there is not a clear Federal role. \n \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) \n \nChild Care.  The Administration appreciates the support provided for the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant, which helps families access child care so they can work, go to school, \nor enroll in a job training program. \n \nHealth Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s continued support of program integrity in health programs and the flexibility the \nbill provides to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to focus funding on the most \nvaluable program integrity efforts and areas of greatest need. \n \nOpioid Abuse and Mental Health Funding.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides \n4 \n  funding to address opioids and mental health, most notably the $1.5 billion provided for State \ngrants to address opioid abuse. \n \nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) Consolidations.  The Administration is disappointed that the \nbill does not consolidate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Institute for \nOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \n(AHRQ), and National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research \nactivities in NIH, as requested in the FY 2019 Budget.  Further, the bill includes funding in \nexcess of the request for NIOSH, AHRQ, and NIH, totaling $4.7 billion above the FY 2019 \nBudget request.  The Administration strongly supports actions that reduce overlap in \nGovernment programs and increase efficiency, and looks forward to working with the Congress \nto achieve these goals. \n \nIndirect Cost Policy.  The Administration is disappointed by the continued inclusion of language \nin the bill (section 226), which prohibits changes to the method NIH uses to pay grantee \ninstitutions for administrative and facilities costs.  In addition, the Administration strongly \nopposes any attempts to prohibit NIH or any other Agency staff from developing strategies to \nmake Government programs more effective and efficient. \n \n21st Century Cures Act Research Policy Board.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill \ndoes not authorize the use of NIH funding to establish and operate the 21st Century Cures Act \nResearch Policy Board, as requested in the FY 2019 Budget.  Further, the indirect cost policy \nprovision noted above makes it difficult to address regulatory burden in a meaningful way.  As a \nresult, the Administration will not be able to establish the Research Policy Board as directed by \nthe Congress. \n \nHealth Professions Training Programs.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill \nprovides unrequested funds for health professions training programs.  The bill provides \n$643 million, which is $555 million more than included in the FY 2019 Budget request. \n \nTeen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program.  The Administration opposes the bill\u2019s inclusion of \n$101 million in unrequested funds for the TPP program.  The TPP program began in FY 2010 to \nprovide competitive grants to replicate successful TPP approaches, test new TPP approaches, and \nidentify the effectiveness of these interventions.  The TPP program serves less than one percent \nof teenagers in the United States.  Although the teenage pregnancy rate has declined \nsignificantly, the evidence suggests that TPP has not been a major driver in that reduction.  \n \nDepartment of Education \n \nCharter Schools.  The Administration appreciates the funding provided in the bill for the Charter \nSchools Program, which is generally consistent with the FY 2019 Budget request.  This funding \nsupports the opening, expansion, and replication of charter schools as well as helps charter \nschool operators access high-quality facilities. \n \nUnnecessary Department of Education Programs.  The Administration is concerned that the bill \nfunds 28 programs that the Administration has proposed for elimination in the FY 2019 Budget \n5 \n  request.  Eliminating these programs, which are duplicative, narrowly-focused, or unable to \ndemonstrate effectiveness, would save nearly $6 billion in FY 2019.  \n \nSchool Choice.  The Administration opposes the lack of funding for Opportunity Grants.  The \nFY 2019 Budget requested $1 billion in funding to empower more families to choose the best \nprivate or public school for their children. \n \nStudent Aid Administration.  The Administration objects to the funding level for Student Aid \nAdministration which is $93 million below the FY 2019 Budget request.  The requested increase \nis needed to service an ever increasing volume of Federal student loans, improve cybersecurity, \nand protect the data of 40 million Americans with student loans.  The Administration also \nstrongly opposes a provision in the bill under the Student Aid Administration heading that would \nconstrain the Department of Education\u2019s authority in awarding a new servicing contract.  The \nprovision would require significant change to the Next Generation Processing and Servicing \nEnvironment procurement, increasing the discretionary cost of Federal student loan servicing, \nand severely restricting the Department of Education\u2019s ability to provide a consistent and \nimproved borrower experience.  \n \nExpansion of Public Service Loan Forgiveness.  The Administration opposes the wasteful \n$350 million funding level for a temporary benefit in the Federal Direct Student Loan program \nthat expands Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility.  In contrast, the Administration \nproposes to eliminate the PSLF program, which unfairly favors certain career choices over \nothers, and instead focuses assistance on undergraduate student borrowers from all professions \nthrough a single income-based repayment plan. \n \nSocial Security Administration (SSA) \n \nLimitation on Administrative Expenses.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nsupport for SSA, including its full funding of program integrity activities to ensure that only \neligible individuals receive Social Security benefits.  \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  The Administration opposes the $274 million funding \nlevel for the NLRB, which is substantially more than the President\u2019s FY 2019 Budget request.  \nNLRB caseload and activities have declined markedly over recent decades, while funding levels \nhave increased.  The NLRB can fulfill its important mission of protecting workers\u2019 statutory \nrights to join, or refrain from joining, labor organizations at lower funding levels.  The \nAdministration requests transferring at least $6 million from NLRB to OLMS within the \nDepartment of Labor, an office that also protects workers\u2019 associational rights and whose \ninadequate funding levels impair its ability to perform its mission.   \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  Such provisions would contravene \nthe separation of powers between the executive branch and the Congress.  In particular, these \n6 \n  provisions would require congressional committee approval of certain executive actions, in \nviolation of INS v. Chadha.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to \naddress these concerns.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2019 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n7 \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\n      May 21, 2018 \n      (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nS. 204 \u2013 Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina \nRight to Try Act of 2017 \n(Sen.

The Administration \nbelieves that these patients and their families should be able to seek access to potentially life-\nsaving therapies while those treatments are still under review by the FDA.   \nSince the late 1980s, FDA has facilitated access to investigational drugs, devices, and biological \nproducts for the treatment of seriously ill patients.  Families in these situations have sometimes \nfound this process challenging, and FDA is constantly striving to make improvements to its \nexpanded access program.  Some patients and their families, however, still have challenges \naccessing investigational treatments.

Frelinghuysen, R-NJ) \nThis Statement of Administration Policy provides views on the House amendment to Senate \namendments to H.R. 244, which contains the text of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n2017. \nThe Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s provision of much-needed funding for our \nmilitary, including approximately $21 billion of the requested $30 billion additional in \nappropriations that the President submitted to the Congress in March 2017.  These funds \nwould accelerate the President\u2019s campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, as \nwell as support ongoing efforts to rebuild and modernize the U.S. Armed Forces.  By \nproviding these funds without a corresponding increase in lower priority non-defense \nfunding, this bill rejects the \u201cparity\u201d construct that for years has jeopardized critical \nincreases in defense spending. \nIn total, the bill represents a $25.7 billion increase in Department of Defense funding over \nfiscal year (FY) 2016 levels. The bill increases end strength by adding 24,000 active-duty \nforces and 12,000 selected reserve forces above the previous Administration's request for \nFY 2017.  It also invests in both near and long-term readiness, provides direct support to \nour warfighters through new and improved equipment, and increases pay for our troops.  In \nFY 2018, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to increase \noverall defense funding by fully eliminating defense sequestration in a fiscally responsible \nmanner. \nWhile the Administration will continue to push for additional funding to stop human and \ndrug trafficking, interdict violent gangs and cartels, and support other enforcement \npriorities, the bill is a good first step, and does make available an additional $1.5 billion for \nthe Department of Homeland Security. Further, the total funding provided for U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement is $18.5 \nbillion, an increase of $1.4 billion over FY 2016. \nThe Administration is also concerned that the Congress did not exercise fiscal restraint, as it \nfailed to include responsible reductions to non-defense discretionary spending to offset \nhigher spending elsewhere. \nThe Administration is also disappointed that this bill provides almost $300 million for \nPuerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid program without underlying reforms to Puerto Rico\u2019s struggling \nhealthcare system, which, like so many aspects of the United States healthcare system, has \nbeen badly damaged by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  The \nAdministration believes that any sustainable solution to Puerto Rico\u2019s dire fiscal situation \nmust include the enactment of pro-growth policies for the island. \n  The Administration strongly supports the inclusion of the District of Columbia Scholarships \nfor Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Reauthorization Act, which delivers on the \nPresident\u2019s promise to provide school choice. The Administration also supports the various \nprovisions in the bill that continue protections for the sanctity of life and the Second \nAmendment. \nMore generally, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to return to \nregular order for the FY 2018 appropriations process, and to enacting legislation that \nreflects the President\u2019s priorities to keep our Nation safe and create jobs and prosperity for \nAmerican workers. \nIf the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 were presented to the President in its current  \nform, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.  \n* * * * * * *   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nSeptember 12, 2017 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 3697 \u2013 Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act \n(Rep.

The bill disapproves a rule that would establish onerous \nrequirements for coal mining operations, and impose significant compliance burdens on \nAmerica\u2019s coal production.  The disapproved rule also duplicates existing protections in the \nClean Water Act and is unnecessary given the other Federal and State regulations already in \nplace.

The bill disapproves an expensive rule that would \nrequire oil and gas producers to reduce natural gas waste and emissions, regardless of whether or \nnot it is economically viable to do so.  The majority of affected oil and gas operators are small \nbusinesses, and productive wells could be unnecessarily shut in to meet the requirements of this \nrule.

In some \ncases, the rule would require companies to disclose information that the host nation of their \nproject prohibits from disclosure or is commercially sensitive.

Schedule A would \nconsist of substances that are analogues of certain substances already controlled by Schedules I \nthrough V of the CSA.

This bipartisan package of healthcare reforms would increase \nthe ability of Americans to use and benefit from health savings accounts (HSAs).  When paired \nwith high-deductible health plans, HSAs are a proven tool to lower healthcare spending by \nincentivizing consumers to obtain higher value healthcare.

Res. 2 \u2013 Proposing a Balanced Budget Amendment to the  \nConstitution of the United States \n(Rep. Goodlatte, R-VA, and 61 cosponsors) \nThe Administration supports passage of H.J. Res. 2, referring to the States for ratification a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  The amendment would \nrequire that Federal Government outlays not exceed receipts in any year unless authorized by \nlegislation passed by three-fifths of the House and Senate.  The amendment would impose \nsimilar supermajority requirements for legislation increasing the limit on Government debt held \nby the public, and would require any legislation increasing revenues to be approved by majority \nroll-call votes.  Finally, the bill recognizes the importance of exceptions for spending in times of \nmilitary conflict.  \nIn his Fiscal Year 2018 and 2019 budget proposals, President Donald J. Trump has proposed \ntrillions of dollars in spending reductions to non-defense programs that would reduce our deficits \nand debt, while ensuring that our military has the resources it needs to keep our Nation safe.  \nThese reductions eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse, and abolish numerous programs that have \nfailed to deliver promised outcomes to the American people. \nWhile President Trump recently signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Omnibus), \ninto law in order to secure a much-needed historic investment in our military and other priorities, \nsuch as rebuilding our infrastructure and combatting the opioid crisis, the Administration \nstrongly believes that the non-defense discretionary spending in the Omnibus demanded by some \nmembers of Congress is a threat to the fiscal stability of our Nation.  Instead of raising taxes on \nthe American people to pay for more Government spending, the Administration believes we \nshould put in place long-term constraints on the growth of Government. \nIn addition to supporting H.J.

Frelinghuysen, R-NJ) \nThe Administration appreciates the investments made to the Nation\u2019s military and infrastructure, \nas well as support for veterans, in H.R. 5895, a bill making appropriations for energy and water \ndevelopment, the Legislative Branch, military construction, Veterans Affairs, and related \nagencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes. \nThe Administration welcomes the House\u2019s timely consideration of appropriations legislation, \nand looks forward to working with the Congress well in advance of the end of the fiscal year to \nenact individual bills that provide sufficient funding to essential programs without further \njeopardizing the Nation\u2019s fiscal state. \nThe FY 2019 Budget request, as amended, accounts for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 \n(BBA\u2019s) new Defense and non-Defense discretionary spending caps for FY 2019.  The \nAdministration strongly supports the overall Defense levels included in the BBA.  However, \ngiven the Nation\u2019s long-term fiscal constraints and the need to right-size the Federal \nGovernment, the Administration does not support the BBA\u2019s non-Defense cap of $597 billion, \n$57 billion above the FY 2019 Budget. \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill. \nDivision A \u2013 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n2019 \nCorps of Engineers \nAgency Topline.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s investments in the Nation\u2019s water \nresources through the Corps of Engineers civil works program.  However, the Administration \nalso believes the bill should encourage a more modern approach to investing in the Nation\u2019s \ninfrastructure that would strike an appropriate balance in incentivizing and facilitating greater \nnon-Federal participation in water resources projects while maintaining robust support for \ninfrastructure where Federal investment is most warranted and needed. \nDepartment of Energy \nNuclear Posture Review (NPR).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support \nfor modernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, recapitalization of the associated  infrastructure, strengthening nuclear nonproliferation and nuclear counterterrorism efforts, and \nthe Naval Nuclear Propulsion program.  The bill funds the foundational aspects of the NPR\u2019s \ncritical programs and activities at requested levels. \n \nPlutonium Infrastructure.  The Administration objects to the establishment of a new construction \nproject at Los Alamos National Laboratory for capital improvements and equipment installations \nbeyond ongoing work in Plutonium Facility 4.  Designating this program scope as a new line \nitem is not in accordance with department orders on project and program management, would \nadd cost and time to execute, and would greatly increase risk to meeting the 30 pit per year goal \nby 2026. \n \nOffice of Science.  The Administration supports funding basic research and development (R&D).  \nHowever, the bill provides $6.6 billion for the Office of Science, $1.2 billion more than the \nFY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration urges restraint in funding these programs. \n \nApplied Energy Programs.  The Administration believes the bill provides excessive funding for \nthe Department\u2019s applied energy programs.  The bill provides $4.2 billion for these programs, \n$2.4 billion more than the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration encourages the \nCongress to restrain funding levels in these programs and focus resources on early-stage R&D \nacross the applied energy technology spectrum rather than late stage or near commercial ready \ntechnology.  \n \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration believes that the \ncontinued funding of ARPA-E makes little strategic sense given the existence of applied energy \nresearch elsewhere within the Department.  The Congress is urged to eliminate ARPA-E and \nincorporate its more successful elements, such as coordination with industry and cross-cutting \nresearch, into the Department\u2019s applied energy programs. \n \nLoan and Loan Guarantee Programs.  The bill maintains the Title XVII Innovative Technology \nLoan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, and \nthe Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program.  In the FY 2019 Budget request, the Administration \nproposed eliminating these programs and funding only the minimum administrative expenses \nnecessary to monitor the existing portfolio.  The Congress is encouraged to adopt the elimination \nproposals to recognize the private sector\u2019s primary role in taking risks to finance projects in the \nenergy and automobile manufacturing sectors. \n \nDepartment of the Interior \n \nBureau of Reclamation.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s investments in the Nation\u2019s \nwater resources through the Bureau of Reclamation.  However, the Administration also believes \nthe bill should encourage a more modern approach to investing in the Nation\u2019s infrastructure that \nwould strike an appropriate balance in incentivizing and facilitating greater non-Federal \nparticipation in water resources projects while maintaining robust support for infrastructure \nwhere Federal investment is most warranted and needed.  \n \n \n2 \n  Division B \u2013 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2019 \n \nHouse and Joint Items.  The Administration recognizes that the Legislative Branch needs \nadequate funding to maintain operations and ensure the safety and security of Members of \nCongress, their staff, and visitors.  However, the bill provides $328 million above the level \nassumed in the FY 2019 Budget.  \n \nDivision C \u2013 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct, 2019 \n \nDepartment of Defense \n \nUnrequested Reprioritization of Military Construction Funding.  The Administration objects to \nthe bill\u2019s realignment of requested military construction funding from priority projects to other \nunrequested projects.  Contrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible full funding policy, \nthe bill instead proposes to incrementally fund 12 military construction projects, effectively \npassing the required $900 million amount needed to fully fund the projects to future year \nbudgets.  Further, the bill diverts almost $1 billion from the projects requested for full funding, \nor from rescissions of prior year funds, to other unrequested projects.  Many of these unrequested \nprojects are not ready for construction due to the lack of planning and design and are not \nincluded in the Department of Defense\u2019s Future Years Defense Program.  By incrementally \nfunding military construction projects to fund unrequested projects, the bill delays critical \nresources to complete high-priority projects that would be initiated in FY 2019 and puts the \nburden on future budgets to make up the difference. \n \nDetention Facilities at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.  The Administration appreciates the \nbill\u2019s support for military construction of a high-value detention facility at Naval Station \nGuantanamo Bay. \n \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs \n \nVeterans Affairs (VA) Funding.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided \n$85.3 billion in discretionary funding, $3.9 billion above the FY 2018 enacted and equal to the \nFY 2019 Budget request. \n \nVeterans Community Care Programs.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee \nhas not accepted the Administration\u2019s proposal to fully fund Veterans Community Care resource \nrequests with discretionary funding, subject to annual appropriations.  Although the FY 2019 \nBudget requested $1.9 billion in discretionary funding to continue the Choice program that this \nAppropriations Act does not provide, the Administration acknowledges that the MISSION Act \nprovided that funding in mandatory resources.  Furthermore, since the Administration expected \nthe MISSION Act to be in place by the beginning of FY 2018, the delay in enacting the \nMISSION Act\u2019s new community care program increases the requirements to continue VA\u2019s \ncurrent, traditional community care program by an additional $1.6 billion in FY 2019. The \nAdministration looks forward to working with Congress to secure this funding within the \nexisting non-defense discretionary cap.  \n3 \n   \nVA Electronic Health Record.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for the \n$1.2 billion requested in the FY 2019 Budget to continue the implementation of VA\u2019s new \nelectronic health record (EHR).  Having veterans\u2019 complete and accurate health information in a \nsingle common EHR system is critical to patient care and safety.  This new EHR system would \nenable VA to easily adopt improvements in health information technology and cyber security \nthat the current system, VistA, is unable to incorporate. \n \nVA Capital Infrastructure Programs.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for a \ncombined total of $4.9 billion for three VA capital programs (major construction, minor \nconstruction, and non-recurring maintenance), roughly $1.5 billion above FY 2018 enacted, and \n$1.9 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request. \n \nMedical Accounts Merger.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not merge, as \noutlined in the FY 2019 Budget request, the Medical Community Care and Medical Services \naccounts within the Veterans Health Administration.  The separate appropriation for community \ncare has restricted VA\u2019s ability to efficiently manage its budget at the local level and make \ndecisions about whether care is provided in VA\u2019s own facilities or is purchased from community \nproviders or Federal partners.  Healthcare delivery is a dynamic situation, and merging the two \naccounts would maximize VA\u2019s ability to focus its resources on the services veterans need most, \nwhile providing the Congress the transparency desired to monitor spending. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, certain sections would \ninterfere with the President\u2019s constitutional authority and duty to protect national security, as \nwell as his authority as Commander in Chief.  Certain other provisions would contravene the \nseparation of powers.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to \naddress these concerns. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2019 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n4 \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\n     November 15, 2018 \n (Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nS.J.Res. 65 - Relating to the disapproval of the proposed export to the Government of \nthe Kingdom of Bahrain of certain defense articles and services \n(Sen.

This system is intended for the territorial defense of Bahrain, which \nis home to U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, forward-deployed U.S. \nMarine Central Command, and the Combined Maritime Force.  The utilization of this ground-based \nsystem  would  enhance  Bahrain\u2019s  ability  to  protect  itself  against  threats  to  territorial  sovereignty, \nparticularly from Iran.

State medical liability rules often \nallow for unlimited non-economic damages.  This encourages providers to practice \ndefensive medicine, increases the cost of healthcare, and imposes a significant burden on \nhealthcare providers. \nH.R. 1215 would limit non-economic damages to $250,000 and limit the fees lawyers may \ncharge in a healthcare lawsuit.  The bill would also impose a three-year statute of \nlimitations on such lawsuits.  H.R. 1215 would apply to healthcare lawsuits where coverage \nwas provided through a Federal program, subsidy, or tax benefit.  The bill reflects a reform \nproposed in President Trump\u2019s Fiscal Year 2018 budget. \nIn addition to the provisions in H.R. 1215, the President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget proposal would \nalso modify the collateral source rule to allow evidence of a claimant\u2019s income from other \nsources to be introduced at trial.  The proposal would provide a safe harbor for providers \nbased on defined clinical standards; authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto provide guidance to States to create expert panels and administrative healthcare tribunals; \nand exclude provider expressions of regret or apology from evidence in a healthcare \nlawsuit.

The rule applies the privacy requirements of the Communications Act \nof 1934 to broadband Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and other telecommunications \ncarriers.  In particular, the rule requires ISPs to obtain affirmative \"opt-in\" consent from \nconsumers to use and share certain information, including app usage and web browsing \nhistory.  It also allows ISPs to use and share other information, including e-mail addresses \nand service tier information, unless a customer \"opts-out.\"  In doing so, the rule departs from \nthe technology-neutral framework for online privacy administered by the Federal Trade \nCommission.  This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the \nidentity of the online actor. \nIf S.J.Res. 34 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign \nthe bill into law.\n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\n July 23, 2018  \n (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 6311 \u2013 Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and \nExpanding Health Savings Accounts Act of 2018 \n(Rep. Roskam, R-IL, and one cosponsor) \nThe Administration supports H.R. 6311, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and \nExpanding Health Savings Accounts Act of 2018.  This commonsense package of healthcare \nreforms would give Americans greater ability and incentive to save for healthcare expenses.  It \nwould allow them more control over how to spend their resources to best improve their \nhealthcare and health and it would lower insurance premiums for millions of Americans.   \nCombined with a qualifying health plan, health savings accounts (HSAs) are proven tools to \nreduce health care costs by better engaging consumers in their health care decisions.  H.R. 6311 \nwould allow more Americans to obtain greater benefit from HSAs, by raising contribution limits, \nallowing working seniors enrolled in Medicare Part A to contribute to an HSA, and permitting \nHSAs to be paired with Obamacare bronze and catastrophic plans.  This bill would also allow \npeople to roll over a greater amount of Flexible Spending Account contributions, reducing \nwasteful end-of-year healthcare spending. \nInsurance options have dwindled and premiums have soared as a result of Obamacare.  H.R. \n6311 also would take concrete steps to lower health insurance premiums by providing relief from \nObamacare\u2019s tax on health insurance plans and increasing access to lower-cost plans.  The bill is \nconsistent with this Administration\u2019s commitment to give back greater control over healthcare \nchoices to American patients and families. \nIf H.R. 6311 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he sign the bill into law. \n** * * * * * ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\n\t\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\n\t\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503\n\t\nJanuary 29, 2018        \n(House Rules) \nS O A P  \nTATEMENT  F  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nHouse Amendment to H.R. 695 \u2014 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018  \n(Rep. Frelinghuysen,  R-NJ) \nThe Administration supports the House amendment to the Senate-passed H.R. 695, making \nappropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, \n2018, and for other purposes. This legislation provides  the resources the military needs to keep \nthe Nation safe, and is consistent with the President\u2019s pledge to undo the looming defense \nspending reductions that are harmful to America\u2019s national security and military readiness. \nThis bill includes a total of $659 billion  for the Department of Defense (DOD), including $584 \nbillion in base spending and $75 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.  The bill \nsupports a total funding level for DOD similar to that authorized by the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for FY 2018, which was signed into law by the President. \nThe U.S. military\u2019s greatest asset is the men and women who volunteer to serve.  This bill \nkeeps faith with service members by providing a 2.4 percent military pay raise.  It increases end \nstrength across the military services for active duty, reserve, and National Guard personnel, and \nincludes funding for training and maintenance to ensure that United States troops are properly \nequipped and ready to fight. \nThe Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of the remaining $1.2 billion of \nthe request in H.R. 695, to support increased troop levels in Afghanistan, special operations \nforces capabilities, and other urgent needs.  This amount is consistent with the budget \namendment that the Administration submitted to the Congress on November 6, 2017. \nIn addition to supporting H.R. 695, the Administration will continue to support a responsible \ntwo-year budget agreement that ensures critical defense funding without holding it hostage to \narbitrary demands for lower-priority domestic programs. \nIf H.R. 695 were presented  to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he sign the bill into law. \nConstitutional Concerns \nCertain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns. The Administration looks forward \nto working with Congress to address these concerns. \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2018 \nappropriations process moves forward. \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\n\t\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\n\t\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503\n\t\nMay  22, 2018 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION   OLICY \nH.R. 5515 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 \n(Rep. Thornberry, R-TX, and Rep. Smith, D-WA)  \nThe Administration appreciates the continued work of the House Armed Services Committee \n(Committee) on behalf of our national defense. The annual National Defense Authorization Act  \n(NDAA) is an essential  step in securing the Nation, and the  Administration supports  ultimate  \npassage of an NDAA for the 57th consecutive year.  \nThe  Administration  appreciates  the  bill\u2019s  provisions  that enable  implementation of the  \nNational Security Strategy and the  National Defense Strategy, both of which focus on a return \nto principled realism  in an era of great power competition. The bill\u2019s overall authorizations of  \nbase national defense funding and Overseas Contingency Operations funding are  consistent  \nwith the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the FY 2019 President\u2019s Budget request.  \nFurther, the  bill  authorizes funding and supports  our efforts to destroy the remaining forces of  \nthe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), rebuild readiness, execute  the Administration\u2019s  \nSouth Asia  Strategy, deter potential  adversaries, and bolster  our allies. The bill also supports  \nthe Administration\u2019s requested  pay raise, military end-strength levels, and many of the Nuclear  \nPosture Review initiatives. It also  includes  important reforms to Department of  Defense  \n(DOD)  management and business practices.   \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress  to address its  concerns, a  \nnumber of which are outlined below. The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the  \nclassified annex  to the  committee report and working with Congress to address any concerns  \nabout classified programs.  \nRoles of Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy (USD(P)) and Under Secretary of Defense for  \nIntelligence (USD(I)).  The  Administration strongly objects to section 904(b), which would \ntransfer  certain technology protection functions related to export controls  from the USD(P) to \nthe  USD(I).  The  USD(P)  plays the lead role within DoD on ensuring that defense cooperation \nwith foreign partners protects sensitive United States  technologies  and aligns  with National  \nDefense Strategy priorities.  Technology security and export  control  activities directly support \npolitical-military relationships, security cooperation efforts, and  multilateral non-proliferation  \nexport control activities.  Technology security arrangements  negotiated and implemented by  \nthe Defense Technology Security Agency  in support of defense cooperation activities are  \nworked in close coordination with the Department of State and other departments and agencies  \nin the interagency.  The  USD(P) is the principal representative of  DoD in the interagency and  \nto the State Department.  \n1 \n   \n \nDetention Facilities at Naval Station  Guantanamo Bay. The Administration strongly objects to \nthe absence  of the authorization for  military construction of  a High-Value Detention  Facility at \nNaval Station Guantanamo Bay.  The President  has ordered continued detention operations at  \nNaval Station Guantanamo Bay.  The current facility for high value detainees is experiencing  \nstructural and system failures that, if  unaddressed, could in the future pose life and safety risks  to \nour guard forces and the  detainees being held there; it also does not meet the requirements of the  \naging detainee population.  \nRepeal of Certain Determinations Required for Grants of Exceptions to  Cost or Pricing Data  \nCertification Requirements and Waivers of Cost Accounting Standards.   The Administration  \nstrongly objects  to section 877, which would permit the waiver of the requirement to submit  \ncertified cost and pricing data without first establishing that the data cannot be obtained from  \nthe contractor when needed at the contracting officers\u2019 request to support  a price  \nreasonableness determination.  Section 877 would place contracting officers at  a significant  \ndisadvantage in negotiating fair and  reasonable prices,  resulting in increased cost  to the \ntaxpayers and the Department.  \nAdvisory Boards Regarding Military Commissaries and Exchanges. The Administration strongly \nobjects to section 624, which would establish an advisory board consisting of  military service  \norganization or veteran service organization representatives at each installation with either a  \ncommissary or exchange. This provision is duplicative of established advisory and feedback \nchannels.  The Department estimates this provision would establish approximately 255 new  \nadvisory boards and increase costs to DOD by at least $145 million annually.  In addition, many \nremote and overseas  locations do not have appropriate military service organizations  or veteran  \nservice organizations, or represent  the primary customers at these locations.  \nBackground investigation and security clearance-related provisions.  The Administration  \nstrongly objects  to section 1626, which would prohibit  the obligation or  expenditure of FY 2019 \nfunds to transfer the background investigation mission from the National  Background \nInvestigations Bureau to DOD  before December 31, 2019.  The Administration is committed to  \nachieving an efficient, fiscally viable, and secure  background investigations operation, and looks  \nforward to discussing its  plan to  reform this critical mission with the Congress.   The  \nAdministration also objects to sections 541, 1622, 1623, 3111, and 3112, which pertain to the  \nprocesses for conducting, reviewing, and adjudicating the security clearances of dual citizens and \nof personnel convicted of certain offenses. These provisions interfere with the governance  \nstructure for policy and oversight of the government\u2019s security clearance  programs, duplicate  \nexisting policy, and would likely limit clearance  reciprocity.  \nAdditional  Requirements for Negotiations for Noncommercial Computer Software. The  \nAdministration supports the general  preference for negotiating specialized software licenses.   \nHowever, the Administration strongly objects to section 871, which would prohibit DOD from  \nrequiring minimum license rights that are necessary to protect  critical DOD operational and  \nmission needs, including emergency repair activity, utilizing Modular  Open Systems  Approaches  \nin the Development of Weapon Systems (required by 10 U.S.C. 2446a), and mitigating \n  2 \n  cybersecurity vulnerabilities or other  supply chain risks.  \nLimitation Pending Certification on the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System  \n(JSTARS) Recapitalization Program.   The Administration objects  to section 214, which would \nrestrict the obligation of funds for the Advanced Battle-Management System (ABMS) and \nreduce DOD\u2019s  proposed divestment of legacy E-8C aircraft until the Secretary of the  Air Force  \ncertifies that the JSTARS  recapitalization program is proceeding unhindered with the  plan in the  \nPresident\u2019s  2018 Budget request.  The JSTARS recapitalization  program will be  unable to \nperform its mission in high-end contested environments, which is counter to the National  \nDefense Strategy.   As such, the Administration strongly believes the JSTARS  recapitalization  \nprogram does not meet the needs of the  warfighter across the  full spectrum of conflict and that \ninvesting in ABMS is prudent and better postures DOD  for the future warfighting environments.  \nOpen Skies Treaty.   The Administration objects to the elimination of the  $222.2 million FY 2019 \nfunding request in section 4101 for the C-135B as \u201cahead of need.\u201d The Air Force expects to be in  \na position to execute  this procurement and requires the FY 2019 funding to replace the existing \nfleet of 1960s-era OC-135B U.S. Open Skies Treaty (OST) observation aircraft with modern, \ncapable, and  cost-effective aircraft.   At present,  the United States  is not able to fully  exercise its  \nrights under  the OST as some Open Skies airfields are not  accessible to  the  current  OC-135B  \naircraft.   The Administration also objects to section 1232, which would tie U.S. votes on Treaty \ndecisions at  the Open Skies Consultative Commission (OSCC) to the completion of an unrelated  \ncertification.    \nUnfunded Navy Ships.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for increasing \nthe size of the fleet and  shares the Committee\u2019s desire to increase our submarine and carrier force.   \nHowever, the Administration objects to specific  provisions  which may inadvertently restrict the  \nability to  invest in our fleet in a  responsible  and sustainable manner.  For instance, section 130 \nprohibits the Navy from  fully exercising the FY 2019 Virginia-class submarine (SSN) five-year  \nmulti-year procurement authority until the Navy  certifies it will procure two  more SSNs than are  \ncurrently in the  budget.  In addition, section 122(b) provides incremental funding authority over  \nan indefinite period for  CVN-81 as well as CVN-80, which is inconsistent with acquisition best  \npractices.  Additionally,  section 121 increases the requirement for operational aircraft carriers \nfrom 11 to 12, which may not be sustainable within the Navy\u2019s current topline.  The  \nAdministration looks forward to working with Congress to determine the  most cost-effective and  \nfiscally responsible path forward to deliver the Navy the Nation  needs.  \nMissile Defense. The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for enhancing the  \nNation\u2019s missile defense system.  However, the  Administration has concerns with sections 1661 \nand 1662 as  currently written.  The Administration believes it  is premature to mandate specific \nsolutions while the Department continues to evaluate the best technical and fiscal approaches.   \nThe Administration will work with Congress to  ensure that the Nation is provided with an  \nenhanced, layered missile defense that  is  appropriate, affordable, and sustainable, consistent with \nthe forthcoming Missile Defense Review.  \nLimitation on Availability of Funds for Army Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor.   The  \nAdministration objects to section 1668.  The inability to obligate fifty percent of Army Lower  \nTier Air and Missile Defense Sensor program funding will limit the Army\u2019s ability to  meet the \ndesired  accelerated initial operating capability  (IOC) timeline.   The Administration also objects to  \n  3 \n  the requirement in section  1668 to submit a report that contains a funding profile and  schedule to \nensure that such sensor  would achieve IOC by December 31, 2023.  \nPrincipal Advisor on Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction.   The Administration objects to \nsection 1072, which would require the Secretary  of Defense to designate a Principal  Advisor on  \nCountering  Weapons of  Mass Destruction  (CWMD) with responsibility  to  supervise activities  \nacross the Department.   On April 9, 2018, the Deputy Secretary directed the establishment of a  \nCWMD  Unity of Effort Council.  The Council will expeditiously address issues that affect the \nCWMD mission.  \nSanctions  Relating to Russia.  The Administration has taken numerous actions against Russia as \nwell as Russian corporations and individuals, in response to their wide  range of  malign activities, \nincluding  continuing to occupy Crimea and instigate violence  in eastern Ukraine, supplying the  \nAssad regime in Syria with material  and weaponry as they bomb their own citizens, attempting to \nsubvert Western democracies,  and malicious cyber activities. Even as these actions are enforced,  \nthe Administration appreciates that section 1236 would provide some additional flexibility in \ngranting waiver relief from certain Russian-related sanctions  under the Countering America\u2019s  \nAdversaries  Through Sanctions Act, which are  required for persons engaging in significant  \ntransactions with Russian defense and intelligence sectors and which could ensnare key  United \nStates  partners and allies should they so engage  to support  their defense  requirements.   As  \nexpressed  in the joint letter from Secretary Mattis and Secretary Pompeo to the key House \ncommittees and leadership on May 8th, the Administration seeks adequate flexibility to avoid \ninadvertent  damage to our efforts to build and sustain key relationships with allies and partners. As \nUnited States  allies and partners support  United States  national  security activities  while they  \ntransition to non-Russian systems, it is important that waiver relief for this purpose be  included in \nthis legislation.  \nMinimum Confinement  Period for Convictions of Certain Sex-related Offenses Committed by  \nMembers of  the Armed Forces.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s continued focus  \non DOD\u2019s efforts to eliminate harassment and sexual assault.   However,  the  Administration objects  \nto section 531 because it  is contrary  to established  Federal practice and, given the broad scope of  \nsex-related  offenses in the military justice system,  would likely adversely impact the interests of  \njustice, including those of crime victims.   This change discourages offers to plead guilty and takes  \naway flexibility from a General Court-Martial Convening Authority and prosecutors.   \nAuthorities and Responsibilities of the Chief Management Officer  (CMO) of the Department of  \nDefense.   The Administration objects to  expanding the CMO\u2019s authority, direction, and control  \nwith respect  to all the Defense Agencies and DOD Field Activities.   Section 911 would create  \ncontradictory and conflicting authorities  and relationships between the CMO and Office of the  \nSecretary of Defense (OSD) Principal Staff Assistants.   While the Department  appreciates the \ncongressional intent,  the CMO has all of the necessary authorities required to oversee efficiency  \nand effectiveness related to the business aspect  of covered activities.   \nTransition of Certain Defense Agencies and Department of Defense Field  Activities.   The  \nAdministration objects to  directing  the Department to transfer all information technology  \ncontracting, acquisition, and senior  leader communication services of the  Defense Information \nSystems Agency (DISA) to other DOD elements.  This action would increase the cost of  \nacquiring information technology, weaken the Department\u2019s  ability to secure its cyber  \n  4 \n  networks, and inhibit DISA\u2019s  mission to provide  seamless communication to warfighters and \nsenior  leaders.  The Administration also urges Congress to include the  Washington \nHeadquarters Services in the review  of all the Defense Agencies and DOD Field Activities \ndirected in  section  913(c)  instead of eliminating it as section 913(b)  directs.   \nImprovements to Acquisition System, Personnel, and Organization of Space Forces.   The  \nAdministration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s continued focus and attention as it  executes its \noversight responsibilities of our nation\u2019s military space capabilities and forces.   However, the  \nAdministration believes that section 1601 is premature.   The Department currently is  \nconducting a review of  its space organizational and management structure as required by \nsection 1601 of the FY 2018 NDAA.   Once complete,  the Administration  will review these \nfindings  and  deliver the required report  and consult with Congress.  \nCloud Services.   The acceleration of cloud technologies  is critical to developing technologies such  \nas artificial  intelligence and  machine  learning.  In order to maintain our military advantage, the  \nAdministration will responsibly leverage foundational  infrastructure and platform technologies  \nfrom the  commercial  sector.  The Administration looks forward to providing the  information \nrequested in section 1053 to both enable proper congressional oversight and prevent delays  in the  \ndelivery of new capabilities to  the warfighter.  \nPlan for Elimination or Transfer of the Strategic  Capabilities  Office (SCO) of the Department of  \nDefense.   The Administration objects to section 218, which would require DOD to develop a  \nplan to eliminate or transfer the SCO.   The Administration views the SCO\u2019s work as critical to  \nmaintaining our advantage over our  strategic competitors and is concerned that  its  elimination \nand transfer  of functions would place  our operating forces at  risk.  \nDefending United States Government Communications.   The Administration  supports the  \ngeneral approach of  section 880.  However, we are concerned about the  unintended \nconsequences of  such a broad prohibition.  The Administration looks forward to working with \nCongress to ensure the scope of the  provision both protects our national security and maintains  \nour ability to execute our mission.  \nTransition of Administration by Defense Health  Agency (DHA) of Military Medical  Treatment  \nFacilities (MTFs).   The Administration supports language  in section 711,  which would permit  \nphasing the transfer of the administration and management of MTFs from the Services to DHA  \nover a two-year period.  However, the Administration objects to language that would prohibit the  \nSecretary of Defense from closing any MTFs, limit the health  services provided by an  MTF, or  \ntake any action to begin such a closure or limitation until  after the  transition.  The Administration  \nalso  objects to  section 721, which would create a TriService Dental Research Program at the \nUniformed  Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), since a TriService Center of Oral  \nHealth Studies already exists at USUHS and the center could broaden its research role.    \nPer Diem Allowance Policies.   The Administration objects to section 605, which would prevent  \nthe Secretaries of the military departments from implementing a reduced per diem for uniformed \nService members and civilian employees who travel to one  location for more than 30 days. This  \nprovision  is unnecessary because DOD has already implemented a policy allowing the Services to  \npay travelers\u2019 actual expenses up to  the full per diem rate when the reduced flat rate for meals and  \nincidental  expenses is insufficient for the assignment.   \n  5 \n  Military Housing Privatization  Initiative (MHPI).   The Administration objects  to section 604, \nwhich would require the Secretary to pay lessors  of covered housing five  percent  of the basic \nallowance for  housing (BAH) amount.  While the section\u2019s  intent is to ensure that  MHPI  project \nentities are able to sustain and recapitalize privatized family housing, the  United States  \ngovernment does not have the authority to mandate how  these  entities manage increased  \npayments.  Section 604 also would effectively provide financial support  to MHPI project entities  \nthat  is not afforded to other private entities that have service member tenants, creating different  \nhousing standards for military families living in  private housing on an installation compared to \nthose  living off-installation.  This provision would  cost as much $200 million in FY 2019 and \nmore than $1 billion over the next 5 years  to subsidize privatized family housing, which would \ndivert resources critical  to build a more lethal, resilient, agile, and ready Joint Force.  Finally,  it is  \nnot  possible for  DOD  to  make monthly payments, except  in arrears, because of the time and  \ncomplication involved in establishing the amount owed under the provision.  \nUnrequested Re-prioritization of Military Construction Funding.   The Administration objects to the  \nbill\u2019s realignment of requested military construction funding from priority  projects to  other \nunrequested projects.  Contrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible full funding policy, the  \nbill  instead proposes to incrementally fund 12 military construction projects, effectively passing \nthe required $900 million amount needed to fully fund the projects to future year budgets. Further, \nthe bill diverts almost one billion dollars from the projects requested for full funding, or from  \nrescissions of prior year funds, to other unrequested projects.   Many of these unrequested projects  \nare not  ready for construction due  to the lack of planning and design and are not  included in \nDOD\u2019s Future Years Defense Program.   By incrementally funding military construction projects to \nfund unrequested projects, the bill delays critical resources to  complete high-priority projects  \ninitiated in FY 2019 and puts the burden on future budgets  to make up the difference.   \nImprovements to Research and Development and Acquisition  Processes of Missile Defense  \nAgency (MDA).   The Administration objects to section 1663(c), which would require  MDA  to \npublicly release the quarter and fiscal year execution of planned  missile defense flight  tests.  \nDue to the need to safeguard critical  defense information, DOD no longer  discloses the dates \nand times of missile defense flight tests prior to  the required  safety notifications.  The  \nAdministration also objects to section  1663(b), which  imposes  a 180-day waiting period to \nimplement improvements to non-standard acquisition processes  and restricts changes to  \nrequirements generation processes.  \nProvision of Space Situational Awareness Services and Information.  The Administration  \nobjects to section 1603, which would terminate  DOD\u2019s authority to provide space situational  \nawareness data to commercial and foreign entities on January 1, 2024, and require the  \nSecretary of Defense to enter  into a contract with a federally funded research and development  \ncenter to assess which department or  departments should assume these authorities.   This  \nwould interfere with ongoing Executive Branch efforts, including efforts led by the Vice \nPresident as Chair of the National Space Council.   As noted by the Vice President during his  \nspeech at the Space Symposium on April, 16, 2018, the National Space  Council  staff is  \ncoordinating  a space traffic management policy for the President\u2019s approval which already \naddresses roles and responsibilities for space situational awareness data and space traffic \nmanagement services.   The policy  establishes a partnership between the Departments of  \nDefense and Commerce with Defense maintaining the authoritative catalog and Commerce \nserving as the civil agency public  interface.    \n  6 \n  Limitation on Availability of Funds for Joint Space Operations Center Mission System.   The  \nAdministration objects to section 1609, which would restrict all funding for the Joint Space  \nOperations  Center Mission System, and funding for the Enterprise Space  Battle  Management  \nCommand and Control program to 75 percent of the funds made available  for FY 2019 until  the  \nDeputy Secretary of Defense certifies to the congressional defense committees that  the Secretary of  \nthe Air Force has entered into a contract  to provide existing best-in-breed commercial space \nsituational awareness processing software.  This  provision will add additional cost and schedule  to \nboth programs and delay delivery of a critical space situational awareness capability  to the \nwarfighter.  \nDesignation of Navy Commanders.   The Administration objects to section 905, which would \nrequire the Secretary of the Navy to designate a single commander within the Department of the  \nNavy responsible for ensuring Navy forces are available for tasking and deployment, including \nthose forces  that may be operating from a forward deployed location.   This section would also \ndesignate a single commander to oversee all shipyards, including those overseas.  These provisions \nwould intrude on the authority and the prerogative of the Secretary of the Navy to manage the  \norganization to provide the best support  to  the Secretary of Defense and the President.   \nSurface Warfare Officers (SWOs) Career Paths.   The Administration objects to section 502, \nwhich would establish a specialized  career path for SWOs.  Separating SWOs into two career  \npaths would  limit mastery  of core skillsets that are fundamental in developing a warfighter  to \nlead, fight, and operate complex U.S. Navy warships.  Pursuant to critical  lessons-learned from  \nthe 2017 Strategic Readiness Review and Comprehensive Review, the introduction of new  \nclassroom courses, enhanced simulator training, and frequent career milestone evaluations  \nstrengthen the core skillsets required for every SWO, and optimizes the development,  \nassessment, and sustainment of proficiency across the SWO  career path.   \nPurchase of Vessels Using Funds in National Defense Sealift Fund. The Administration \nappreciates the Committee\u2019s support in section 1022 of the Department\u2019s efforts to recapitalize  \nthe Ready Reserve Force and the U.S. Navy\u2019s Military Sealift Command (MSC) surge fleet by \nincreasing the amount of used foreign-built vessels authorized for purchase.  However, the  \nAdministration objects to withholding 25 percent  of MSC\u2019s funds in FY 2019 as restrictions  \non funding will limit MSC\u2019s ability  to support worldwide sealift and other ongoing operations  \n(replenishment of U.S. Navy vessels at sea, oceanographic survey and surveillance, \nexpeditionary sea bases for SOF,  mine counter measures,  and special mission support).  \nNational Guard Promotion Accountability.   The Administration objects to section 513.   By  \nmandating an effective date of promotion after Federal Recognition based upon the actions of a  \nGovernor of a  State, the  provision infringes on the authority of the President and Secretaries of  \nmilitary departments to  appoint officers in the National Guard of the United States, which is part  \nof the military\u2019s Reserve Component.  This provision would result  in inequitable treatment  \namong National Guard officers and similarly situated Regular Army, Regular Air Force, United \nStates Army  Reserve, and United States Air Force Reserve officers who are also  subject to  \nreview before their appointment is tendered.  \nUnjustified Reductions  to Operational and Personnel Accounts.   The Administration objects to \nreducing certain operation & maintenance  and military pay accounts by $2.6 billion based on prior-\nyear under-execution in those accounts.   If enacted, these reductions would be applied to critical  \n  7 \n  programs, such as Military Services\u2019 readiness, depot maintenance, base operations support, and \nmilitary pay  and allowances for Service members.   Reducing these programs  would directly impact  \nthe lethality and readiness of DOD, undermining the National Defense Strategy.  \nDual Status  Military Technicians.   The Administration objects to section 506, which would \nguarantee Title 5 employment to any dual status  technician (National Guard or Reserve) who \nloses their position \u201cfor  any reason other  than disqualification.\u201d   The Administration is  \nconcerned that this section, as currently worded, would create an unlimited obligation to provide  \nTitle 5 positions to military technicians who simply abandon their military  memberships, retire  \nmilitarily, or are released from  military service due to force-shaping measures or administrative \ndischarges.   \nLimitations on Authority to Revoke  Certain Military Decorations Awarded to Members of the  \nArmed Forces.   The Administration objects to section 571 because it infringes on the  Service  \nSecretaries' authority to  revoke certain military decorations awarded to Service members in order \nto preserve  the prestige and integrity of  these  awards.  This provision would also be inconsistent  \nwith sections 3744, 6249, and 8744 of title 10, United States  Code, which prohibit  an award to a \nmember  whose service has not been honorable.   \nAccelerating Payments.   The Administration strongly supports improved cash flow to small  \nbusinesses and small business subcontractors, but  has concerns regarding the extent to  which the \naccelerated  payment actions required by section  852 will achieve tangible benefits for small \nbusiness subcontractors.   Because payment practices are industry specific, the benefits of an  \nacross-the-board acceleration of payment by the government to large business prime contractors  is  \nunlikely to produce in-kind benefits for small business subcontractors, but  will create new costs for  \nthe Department to monitor and enforce, and could create other unintended consequences for the  \nDepartment in ensuring payment integrity.      \nTransition Assistance Program.   The  Administration objects to  section 552, which would replace  \nthe current requirement for all Transitioning service members  to participate in the Department of  \nLabor Employment  Workshop (DOLEW) by limiting required instruction related to employment to \nonly one day, instead of the three days in the current Transition Assistance Program (TAP).   Such \nprescriptive  legislation is premature and would restrict the Administration\u2019s flexibility to shape  \nTAP based on the needs of the participants  and findings of ongoing analysis and evaluation.  \nCoast Guard Contracting. The Administration objects to section 3523, which would create a  \nwholly new contract requirement that applies only to the Coast Guard and is outside of general  \ngovernment requirements under the  FAR by requiring Coast Guard contracting officers to include  \nnew clauses  in future contracts to prepare for potential terminations.  This section  is unnecessary  \nand duplicative.  \nWorkforce Issues for Military Realignments in the Pacific.   The Administration appreciates the \nimportant authorities enacted last year in the FY 2018 NDAA, which authorize  admission before  \nOctober 1, 2023 of H-2B workers in  the region  to  perform certain military-related work  \nnecessary for the relocation of Marines to Guam  on planned timelines.   Section 1043 extends  \nexemption from the nation-wide cap on H-1B and H-2B workers for Guam and the  \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  and adds health care workers as exempt from H\u00ad\n2B requirements that the  work be temporary in nature.   The Administration urges the Congress to  \n  8 \n  focus on the Administration\u2019s 2018 requested authorities and fully adopt them to address  \nspecified needs in both Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.  \nProcurement of Ammonium Perchlorate and Other Chemicals for Use in Solid Rocket \nMotors.   The Administration  is concerned by the fragile state of the defense industrial  base for  \nmany specialty chemicals that  are required for, sensitive technologies.   The Administration \nsupports efforts to  ensure that  the materials and  chemicals needed for weapon systems are secure \nand reliable.   The Administration therefore strongly supports Section 1682, which directs the  \nSecretary of the Army to explore  the  possibility of using a government-owned, contractor-operated \nmodel to securely supply specialty chemicals to the Department of Defense for warfighter needs.   \n \nProhibition on Acquisition of Sensitive Materials from Non-Allied Foreign Countries.   The  \nAdministration strongly supports section 873, which directs the Secretary of Defense  to purchase, \nto  the maximum extent possible, rare earth permanent magnets and certain tungsten, tantalum, \nand molybdenum products from sources other  than China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.  The  \nglobal markets for rare earths and tungsten are currently dominated by China, which has pursued \nan aggressive strategy  to control the  supply of these critical materials, resulting  in the loss of  \nAmerican jobs and technology.  This section demonstrates that the United  States will seek  \nalternate sources of supply when foreign nations seek to unfairly disrupt a  marketplace in pursuit  \nof economic and military advantages at variance with  the  strategic interests  of the United States.  \n \n* * * * * * *  \n \n  9 \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nJanuary 29, 2018 \nSenate\nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 2311 - Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act \n(Sen.

This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize \nregional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for \nactivities on public lands.  The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located \nmostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy \nand mineral development.

H.R. \n4909 would help school personnel and law enforcement personnel identify and prevent violence \nin schools.  The bill authorizes $500 million for State-based grants, administered by the \nDepartment of Justice, to support evidence-based violence-prevention programs in every middle \nand high school across the country.  These grants would support a range of pro-active strategies \nfor identifying and preventing school-targeted violence, including evidence-based training, \nanonymous reporting systems, threat assessments, intervention teams, and increased \ncoordination between schools and local law enforcement.  The programs that these grants \nsupport will provide significant improvements to school security. \nThe President\u2019s top priority is to keep the American people safe from those who wish to do \nthem harm or to inflict terror upon them.

Conaway, R-TX) \nThe Administration supports H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, and appreciates \nthe work of House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-TX) and Members of \nthe House Agriculture Committee to pass a farm bill in a manner that provides certainty to our \nNation\u2019s farmers, ranchers, and foresters and enacts common-sense work requirements as part of \nthe overall requirements for eligibility for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \nbenefits.  The Administration believes that work reforms like those in H.R. 2 are a critical \ncomponent of any multi-year farm bill reauthorization. \nSince taking office, President Trump has made modernization of our Nation\u2019s antiquated welfare \nsystem a priority.  Through the Executive Order entitled \u201cReducing Poverty in America by \nPromoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility,\u201d issued on April 10, 2018, the President has \nplaced an emphasis on ending dependency and promoting work\u2014goals that will ultimately \nbenefit millions of Americans.  To that end, by including strong work requirements for able-\nbodied participants in SNAP, H.R. 2 takes a major step toward the President\u2019s vision of welfare \nreform.  These reforms would require adult SNAP participants who are able to work to do so.  It \nwould also provide services that help individuals find work and encourage self-sufficiency.  In \ncontrast to previous farm bills that have contained minimal reforms to SNAP work requirements, \nH.R. 2 is clearly a step toward meaningful welfare reform.  \nThe Administration also appreciates that the bill contains many of the SNAP recommendations \nfrom the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2019 Budget, including fixing SNAP eligibility loopholes that \nallow individuals with assets or incomes above the intended limits to participate.  We look \nforward to continued discussion about ensuring that increases to earned income deductions do \nnot expand eligibility to households that are not already eligible. \nAdditionally, the Administration appreciates that the bill reduces overly generous payments for \nparticipating in the Conservation Reserve Program, eliminates the Conservation Stewardship \nProgram, and pursues management and regulatory reforms on public lands. \nThe Administration would like to highlight several concerns with H.R. 2.  The Administration \nbelieves the bill should not increase spending over the five-year authorization or the ten-year \nbaseline of the bill.  The Administration is also concerned that the bill does not include \nadditional reforms to improve the cost-effectiveness of farm and conservation programs that \nwere proposed in the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2019 Budget.  The Administration would support a \nreform of the Title II food aid program through the farm bill that would maximize resources in \nresponding to global food crises and promoting food security.    The Administration supports a multi-year farm bill that provides long-term certainty to rural \nAmerica and promotes regulatory and spending reforms across farm and nutrition programs. \nOverall, H.R. 2 is a positive step in that direction.  \nIf H.R. 2 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that \nhe sign the bill into law. \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n) \nMarch 22, 2017 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1628 \u2013 American Health Care Act of 2017 \n(Rep.

Thornberry, R-TX, and Rep. Smith, D-WA) \nThe Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s (Committee) continued \nwork on behalf of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in H.R. 2810, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. \nThe bill supports key Administration priorities, including ending the defense sequester, \nrebuilding our military readiness,  and modernizing our force for the future.  It authorizes funding \nfor our ongoing efforts to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), to deter potential \nadversaries, and to bolster our allies.  The bill also includes important reforms to Department of \nDefense (DOD) management and business practices, and the Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Committee to continue finding efficiencies at DOD.  \nThe bill authorizes $18.5 billion above the President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget request for base national \ndefense spending, as well as an additional $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations \n(OCO) funding. The previous Administration enacted harmful cuts to defense spending, and this \nAdministration strongly supports eliminating them.  To ensure that our military is not rebuilt on \nthe backs of future generations of Americans, however, the Administration strongly supports \nreductions to spending elsewhere in the Federal budget, as outlined in the President\u2019s FY 2018 \nBudget request. \nWhile the bill contains many promising reforms, it fails to authorize a new Base Realignment \nand Closure (BRAC) round, which would result in substantial recurring savings and allow DOD \nto align infrastructure with force structure.  The Administration is in the midst of conducting \nseveral strategic reviews  that affect multiple provisions in this bill, such as those addressing \nspace organization and management and naval ship force structure.  Once these reviews are \ncomplete, the Administration will be prepared to suggest modifications to these provisions.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address its concerns, a number of \nwhich are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the \nclassified annex and working with Congress to address any concerns about classified programs. \nProhibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure Round:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges Congress to provide BRAC \nauthorization as requested so that DOD can ensure it is not wasting scarce resources on unneeded \ninfrastructure.  The Department estimates that a new BRAC round in 2021 would save it an \n1 \n additional $2 billion annually\u2014resources it could apply to higher priorities such as readiness and \nmodernization. \n \nEstablishment of Space Corps in the Department of the Air Force:  The Administration \nappreciates the Committee\u2019s concerns with the organization and management of DOD\u2019s space \ncapabilities as reflected in section 1601, which calls for the establishment of a separate Space \nCorps within the Department of the Air Force.  As the Secretary of Defense has testified, the \nAdministration recognizes the criticality of our access to and use of space, and we understand the \nincreasing threats posed  to our continued use of space capabilities.  As directed by the FY 2017 \nNDAA, the Administration is assessing a wide range of organizational options, including a \nSpace Corps.  The creation of a separate Space Corps, however, is premature at this time.  Upon \ncompletion of these analyses, the Administration looks forward to working with Congress to \nimplement military space organizational changes (while considering the budget implications) in \na practical timeframe to best posture the Nation\u2019s joint forces to meet the challenges of the 21st \nCentury. \n \nExtension and Modification of Authority to Provide Assistance to Counter the Islamic State of \nIraq and Syria:  The Administration appreciates the increased funding authority included in \nsection 1222, but notes its concern that the provision does not contain additional requested \nauthority for small-scale construction of temporary facilities that are necessary to meet \noperational needs and force protection requirements in both Iraq and Syria.  As the campaign to \ndefeat ISIS transitions beyond the liberation of Mosul and Raqqa, operational commanders will \nneed the requested authority to build temporary intermediate staging facilities, ammunition \nsupply points, and tactical assembly areas that have adequate force protection.  These facilities, \nsupply points, and assembly areas will enable the pursuit of ISIS into the Euphrates River Valley \nand help improve the security of Iraq\u2019s borders.  Current authorities, limited only to repair and \nrenovation of existing Iraqi facilities, severely limit the coalition\u2019s maneuverability and its ability \nto respond quickly to changing operational conditions.  \n \nExtension and Modification of Authority to Support Operations and Activities of the Office of \nSecurity Cooperation in Iraq: The Administration appreciates the continuation of existing \nauthority, but is disappointed by the lack of authority in section 1223 to expand the list of \neligible recipients to include the \u201cmilitary and other security forces of or associated with the \nGovernment of Iraq with a national security mission.\u201d  The expanded authority would help \naddress capability gaps, professionalization efforts, and defense institution building across the \nbreadth of the Government of Iraq\u2019s (GoI\u2019s) national security institutions.  By aiding the \ndevelopment of the GoI\u2019s most critical missions\u2014counterterrorism, border security, and the \nprotection of critical infrastructure\u2014the expanded authority proposed by the Administration \nwould help Iraqis prevent the emergence of a successor to ISIS, safeguard their nation\u2019s hard-\nfought gains, and guide their recovery from  combat operations toward a more secure and stable \nnation.  \n \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Modernization and Sustainment of Assured \nAccess to Space:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1615, which would restrict \ndevelopment of new space launch systems, including those whose development is significantly \nfunded by industry, in exclusive favor of rocket engines and modifications to existing launch \n2 \n vehicles.  The provision limits domestic competition, which will increase taxpayer costs by \nseveral billions of dollars through FY 2027 and stifle innovation.  It also ignores key \nrecommendations of the Committee\u2019s independent panel of experts, who proposed broad funding \nat the launch-system level.  The Administration\u2019s innovative, agile approach has already saved \ntaxpayers $300 million and is the quickest path to delivering modern, domestic, cost-effective \nlaunch capabilities that will support national security requirements for decades to come.  This \nprovision would make the Administration\u2019s strategy impossible to execute, causing delays in \ntransitioning from  Russian engines and increased risks to continued assured access to space.   \n \nIndustrial Base for Large Solid Rocket Motors and Related Technologies:  The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 1699, which would require the Secretary of Defense to pursue \nmultiple sources for the  various components of modern solid rocket missile systems.  The large \nsolid rocket motor industrial base has many single sources for components and materials.  In \nmany cases, the quantities of systems, subsystems, or components or materials acquired by DOD \nare not sufficient to support multiple suppliers.  In addition, if a second source for these materials \nis required, it would trigger requalification on not only the rocket motor, but also the entire \nmissile.  This would be cost prohibitive to DOD, totaling nearly $1 billion. \n \nNotification Requirements for Sensitive Military Cyber Operations and Cyber Weapons:  The \nAdministration objects to section 1651, which would require the Secretary of Defense to notify \nthe congressional defense committees within 48 hours about the conduct of sensitive military \ncyber operations and the  results of any legal review by a military department of a cyber \ncapability that is intended to be used as a weapon. DOD already regularly briefs the House and \nSenate Committees on Armed Services on major cyber operations. This provision would risk \nexposure, and potentially restrict use, of cyber capabilities; jeopardize foreign partnership \ncooperation; and impose additional, unwarranted administrative requirements on DOD. \n \nMisuse of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Funds:  The Administration is concerned by \nthe use of OCO funds for items not related to contingency operations, including an additional \n$558 million for Israel missile defense funding.  The bill also proposes using OCO to fund \nadditional end strength, ships, and homeland defense.  Funding these enduring requirements in \nOCO would complicate the funding stability for associated outyear costs and runs contrary to the \npurpose of OCO. \n \nDevelopment of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Range Ground-Launched Missile \nSystem:  The Administration objects to sections 1244 and 1245, which would establish a \nprogram of record to develop a road-mobile, ground-launched cruise missile system  and would \npurport to abrogate Article VI of the INF treaty.  The Administration is currently developing an \nintegrated diplomatic, military, and economic response strategy that maximizes pressure on \nRussia.  It is also evaluating those military capabilities that are needed to protect our national \nsecurity. This provision unhelpfully ties the Administration to a specific missile system, which \nwould limit potential military response options.  Section 1245(d) would also raise concerns \namong NATO allies and could deprive the Administration of the flexibility to make judgments \nabout the timing and nature of invoking our legal remedies under the treaty.  The Administration \nwould support broad authorization of research and development on missile systems, including \n3 \n those prohibited by the treaty, to determine candidate systems  that could become programs of \nrecord.  \n \nLimitation on Availability of Funds Relating to Implementation of the Open Skies Treaty:  The \nAdministration objects to section 1235(b), which would prohibit the expenditure of funds for \nprocurement for the Digital Visual Imaging System  to modify the United States sensors and \naircraft.  This section will prevent the United States from keeping pace with Russian Open Skies \naircraft sensor upgrades, fully implementing the Open Skies Treaty, and increasing the value of \nthe treaty to United States national security.  Cancellation of the project at this late date, after \nsignificant resources have already been expended, would further put the United States in breach \nof contract, thus incurring cancellation fees.  The provision would result in limited or no cost \nsavings and possibly a cost increase, which would be an unacceptable waste of taxpayer dollars.  \n \nForeign Commercial Satellite Services: Cybersecurity Threats and Launches:  The \nAdministration strongly objects to section 1612, which would limit the Department\u2019s ability to \nprocure satellite services from foreign entities.  It also would prohibit entering into a contract for \nsatellite services with any entity if such services will be provided using satellites launched from,  \nor designed or manufactured in, a covered foreign country or by an entity controlled by the \ngovernment of a covered foreign country, regardless of the location of the launch.  For satellite \ncommunications services, three-quarters of services acquired  today are from  foreign-\nincorporated companies that make widespread use of international launch vehicles.  \n \nCompensation Reform:  The Administration objects to section 601, which would place \nrestrictions on the President\u2019s authority to set an alternative pay adjustment for members of the \nuniformed services.  The President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget request provides the funding necessary to \nensure servicemembers continue to receive an appropriate package of pay and benefits.  The \nAdministration, however, must balance this requirement against other investments critical to \nreadiness, equipment, and modernization to ensure the military is the most capable warfighting \nforce in the world.  The Administration strongly encourages members of Congress to support its \nbasic pay raise, TRICARE modernization, and pharmacy co-pay proposals, which would save \n$600 million in FY 2018 and $7.1 billion through FY 2022.  Similarly, the Administration \nobjects to section 604, which would prevent the Secretaries of the military departments from  \nimplementing a reduced per diem for uniformed servicemembers and civilian employees who \ntravel to one location for more than 30 days.  This provision is unnecessary because DOD has \nalready implemented a policy allowing the services to pay travelers\u2019 actual expenses up to the \nfull per diem rate when the reduced flat rate for meals and incidental expenses is insufficient for \nthe assignment.  If adopted, this section would add $56 million or more annually to DOD\u2019s travel \ncosts. \n \nTRICARE Reform:  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee did not include the \nAdministration\u2019s proposals to strengthen and improve the TRICARE benefit.  The current \nsystem creates confusion and increases administrative costs because it provides separate benefits \nfor members and retirees based on their dates of initial entry into military service.  Vulnerable \npopulations, including medically-retired members and their families, and survivors of those who \ndied on active duty, also would be the first to pay increased costs under the new system.  In \naddition, the Administration is concerned that the Committee did not include reasonable \n4 \n pharmacy co-pays.  The Administration believes strongly that the President\u2019s FY 2018 Military \nHealth System benefit reform package represents a reasonable and financially sound proposal for \nour beneficiaries.  It protects vulnerable populations, eliminates a confusing and costly two-\nbenefit program, and institutes reasonable pharmacy co-pays  that will ensure TRICARE remains \na generous, yet sustainable, health benefits program.   \n \nLimitation on Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) Modification Authority for Members of the \nUniformed Services Residing in Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) Housing:  The \nAdministration objects to section 602, which would temporarily prohibit the Secretary of \nDefense from further reducing BAH below the current level for servicemembers residing in \nMHPI housing until 2019.  This would create two classes of uniformed members: those who \nreside in privatized housing and receive a higher housing allowance and those who reside within \nthe local community and receive a lower housing allowance.  This is neither fair nor equitable \nsince the opportunity to live in privatized housing on post is not always available.  Administering \nthis section would require an additional set of rates for members in privatized housing, \nnecessitating challenging and costly modifications to military pay systems. \n \nClarification of Roles of Commanders of Military  Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and \nSurgeons General: Section 711 would designate each MTF commander as the individual \nresponsible for the operation of the MTF they supervise.  The Administration is concerned that \nthis section would establish a potentially confusing organizational paradigm, as the Defense \nHealth Agency (DHA) is also responsible for the management and administration of MTFs.  The \nSecretary of Defense should be allowed to determine the most effective management structure \nfor the Military Health System.   \n \nUnobligated Balances Reductions:  The Administration objects to the $1.3 billion reduction for \nunobligated balances across multiple appropriations.  The reductions would only be applied to \nthose programs funded in sections 4301, 4401, and 4501, which include military pay and \nallowances, military health care, readiness training, depot maintenance, base operations support, \nand facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions would \ndelay the DOD\u2019s full-spectrum  readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of \nmaintenance at the services\u2019 depot facilities. \n \nPerformance of Incurred Cost Audits:  The Administration objects to multiple provisions in \nsection 802.  Mandating the acceptance of the claimed costs in their entirety if audit findings are \nnot issued within one year of proposal receipt, restricting the  use of multi-year audits, mandating \nthat an arbitrary 25 percent of incurred costs be audited by qualified private auditors in lieu of a \ndata-driven process, and mandating materiality thresholds will result in significant inefficiencies \nin the DOD audit process and result in significant unallowable costs being paid to contractors.  \nFurther, the materiality thresholds are significantly more prescriptive and detailed than defined in \ncommercial or Government audit standards and are not risk-based. \n \nMissile Defense Programs:  The Administration objects to section 1686, which would require the \nSecretary of Defense to ensure that anti-air warfare capabilities are deployed at the Aegis Ashore \nsite in Romania by no later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, and at the Aegis \nAshore site in Poland no later than one year after the declaration of operational status at that site.  \n5 \n The accelerated timeline would require DOD to field an unproven defensive system without full \nknowledge of its combat effectiveness or the unintended consequences of operating a high-\npowered radar and weapon system  in a populated area surrounding Deveselu, Romania.  The \ndiplomatic requirements to coordinate these issues with other nations are significant, even after \nproving the system  and understanding the consequences of the system on local populations.  In \naddition, the Administration strongly objects to section 1685, which would mandate a flight test \nof the SM-3 Block IIA missile against an ICBM class threat within 270 days of enactment. \n \nReinstatement of Requirement to Preserve Certain C-5 Aircraft:  The Administration strongly \nobjects to section 143, which would require the Air Force to maintain at least 25 C-5A Avionics \nModernization Program (AMP)-modified aircraft in flyable storage.  The Air Force currently has \n52 C-5Ms within its total strategic aircraft inventory.  Requiring the maintenance of an additional \n25 C-5As in flyable condition would  eliminate the relief provided in the FY 2017 NDAA from \nthe FY 2013 NDAA requirement to keep retired C-5As in flyable storage.  The total estimated \ncost to regenerate 25 C-5A AMP aircraft into flyable condition would exceed $5.6 billion, not \nincluding aircrew and maintenance training costs, and would take an estimated nine years to \ncomplete.  \n \nLimitation on Expenditure of Funds for Emergency and Extraordinary Expenses for Intelligence  \nand Counterintelligence Activities and Representation Allowances:  While the Administration \nunderstands the Committee\u2019s concern with the use of these funds and will thoroughly examine \nthis practice, the Administration objects to section 1031, which would prohibit using Emergency \nand Extraordinary Expenses authority for recurring expenses and lower the congressional \nnotification threshold for intelligence and counterintelligence activities.  These changes would \nseverely impede DOD\u2019s ability to conduct intelligence and counterintelligence operations and \nnegatively affect ongoing counterterrorism  and other critical DOD operations. \n \nOpen Discovery Rule:  The Administration shares Congress\u2019 goal of preventing sexual assault in \nthe military and holding accountable those who commit the offense.  Although the \nAdministration is sympathetic to the motivation behind section 524, affording victim\u2019s counsel \nwith open file discovery may have the unintended consequence of impairing the successful \nprosecution of cases by creating additional opportunities for the defense to challenge the victim\u2019s \ntestimony.  In addition, the Administration encourages Congress to consider whether the \ninformation required by section 528 is already provided in annual Family Advocacy Program  \nreports. \n \nModernization of Army Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS): The \nAdministration objects to section 1683, which would direct the Secretary of the Army to issue an \nacquisition strategy no later than April 15, 2018, for a 360-degree lower tier air and missile \ndefense sensor that achieves initial operational capability by January 1, 2022, and completes \nfielding to all Army units by January 1, 2026.  The requirements and timelines in this provision \nare not feasible.  They would prevent the Army from developing LTAMDS integrally as part of \nits phased modernization approach for integrated air and missile defense based on Army and \nJoint Staff validated requirements.  Additionally, the Administration opposes the provision\u2019s \ndirection to transfer the acquisition responsibility of the sensor to the Missile Defense Agency \nshould the Army not issue the strategy in time. \n6 \n  \nIssues for Relocation of Marines to Guam:  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of \nsection 1062, which would authorize the admission before October 1, 2020, of H-2B workers \ncoming to Guam  to perform  certain military-related work or as health care workers under \nmodified admission requirements.  The Administration strongly urges Congress to adopt the \nAdministration\u2019s request, which would, among other things, extend the authority through \nDecember 31, 2023, and address specified needs in both Guam and the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Mariana Islands (the CNMI).  The Department of the Navy\u2019s current workload \nprojections indicate that approximately 2,300 H-2B workers would be required to supplement the \nGuam or CNMI workforce on military build-up construction projects.  Without additional H-2B \nworkers, limited access to construction workers would harm our ability to relocate Marines to \nGuam on planned timelines.  This could be a factor in meeting the commitment of the United \nStates to return land to Japan. \nIn addition, the Administration objects to section 2822, which provides for the land conveyance \nof the Naval Ship Repair Facility, Guam.  The property is not excess to the needs of the \nDepartment of the Navy, as Military Sealift Command awarded a contract for ship repair that \nwill require use of this property.  Opening this property to commercial use also would pose \nsecurity concerns to nearby berthed Navy vessels, including the Department of the Navy losing \ncontrol of whether the commercial entity can perform work on foreign vessels. \nPalau: The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s efforts in section 1265 to fund the 2010 \nUnited States-Palau Compact Review Agreement (CRA), but is disappointed that the Committee \ndid not include the provision requested provision that would approve the 2010 CRA.  As a \nsovereign and freely associated state in the western Pacific, the Republic of Palau carries \nsignificant foreign policy and national security significance for the United States.  Congressional \napproval is required for the United States to enter into the CRA and modify the CRA\u2019s funding \nschedule as necessary for the United States to  meet its international commitments.  Failure to \napprove the CRA could imperil ongoing national security initiatives with the Republic of Palau \nand destabilize United States access and influence in a region that is increasingly contested by \nChina. \n \nMixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility: The Administration strongly objects to section \n3119 directing construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility.  The \nAdministration appreciates the flexibility provided to the Secretary of Energy to waive that \nrequirement and terminate the MOX project.  The MOX project is unaffordable and risky, with \n$12 billion in remaining construction costs, based on the most recent estimate prepared in \ncollaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy.  The project \nwould bring total construction costs to $17 billion, when including $5 billion in sunk-costs to \ndate.  In addition, the projected operating costs are between $800 million and $1 billion per year \nfor nearly two decades.  The Administration supports the Committee\u2019s recommendation to \nauthorize funds for the Savannah River Site\u2019s (SRS) dilute and dispose capability to remove \nfrom South Carolina, and dispose of, surplus plutonium stored at SRS.  Dilute and dispose is a \nproven approach with significantly less risk and expense, and it can be implemented decades \nsooner than the MOX approach. \n \n7 \n Incremental Funding for National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2019s (NGA) New Campus West \n(N2W):  The Administration appreciates the support for NGA\u2019s N2W  facility, but objects to the \nproposed incremental funding approach.  The authorized level in the bill could lead to higher \ntotal project costs, delay the delivery of the campus, and negatively impact other mission-critical \npriorities. \n \nConstitutional Concerns:  Certain provisions in this bill raise  constitutional concerns.  These \ninclude, for example, sections 1232 and 921(b).  Section 1232 would interfere with the \nPresident\u2019s exclusive authority to recognize foreign nations, and section 921(b) would \ncontravene the Appointments Clause by authorizing incumbent officials to serve in new offices \nwithout further appointments.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other \nconcerns as this legislation advances. \n \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n8 \n ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n July 23, 2018  \n (House Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 184 \u2013 Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2017  \n(Rep. Paulsen, R-MN, and 277 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration supports H.R. 184, the  Protect Medical  Innovation Act of 2017, which \nwould permanently repeal  Obamacare\u2019s  tax on medical devices.  Repealing this tax would lower  \nhealthcare costs, save American jobs, and promote a patient-centered healthcare system.   \nThe medical device tax, one of several  harmful  taxes enacted  in  Obamacare, has been delayed  \nseveral times due to bipartisan recognition that, if  imposed, it would raise healthcare costs for  \nmillions of Americans and penalize companies that are investing in medical device research and  \ntechnology.  This tax is an obstacle for patients seeking  access to  medical advances, and \nthreatens to undermine  the position  of the United States  as the global leader in healthcare \ninvestment and innovation.  This tax also reduces the number of high-skilled, highly  \ncompensated American jobs.  Consistent with President Trump\u2019s promise to provide relief to \nAmericans suffering  from the failures of Obamacare,  the Administration calls on the Congress to \nrepeal permanently the unnecessary and  economically harmful medical device  tax.  \nIf H.R. 184 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he sign the bill into law.  \n** * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n) \nSeptember 5, 2017 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3354 \u2014 Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, 2018 \n(Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ) \nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3354, making appropriations for the interior \nand environment, agriculture and rural development, commerce, justice, science, financial \nservices and general government, homeland security, labor, health and human services, \neducation, state and foreign operations, and transportation, housing and urban development for \nthe fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes.\nThe Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s commitment to incorporate the text of \nH.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018, which is a strong step toward \nfulfilling the President\u2019s promise to put the safety of the American people first.  As noted in a \nsupportive Statement of Administration Policy issued on July 24, 2017, H.R. 3219 provides \ncritical funding to rebuild our military and includes the President\u2019s $1.6 billion border wall \nproposal. \nIf H.R. 3354 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he sign the bill into law.\nThe Administration strongly supports the House of Representatives\u2019 efforts to protect the right \nto life, cut down on needless and overly burdensome regulations, and strengthen border and \nimmigration enforcement.  The Administration also appreciates the House of Representatives\u2019 \nwork to rebuild our military and restrain overall non-defense discretionary spending, but notes \nthat current spending levels as reflected in H.R. 3354 and H.R. 3219 would result in a \nsequestration of $72.4 billion in the defense category.  To help avoid a sequestration, the \nAdministration urges both the House and Senate to enact the $57.3 billion in savings included in \nthe Major Savings and Reforms volume of the FY 2018 Budget request while also making the \nnecessary changes to the discretionary caps. \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill.\nDivision A \u2013 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2018\nDepartment of the Interior (DOI)\nFederal Land Acquisition.  The Administration objects to the increase in funding provided by \nthe bill for land acquisition, which is $50 million above the FY 2018 Budget request.  The \nDepartment currently manages roughly 500 million acres and has a deferred infrastructure \nmaintenance backlog of approximately $15 billion.  Limited resources should be focused on \nongoing operations and maintenance. DOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service \n \nWildland Fire Funding.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s investment in wildland fire \noperations at $3.4 billion as requested in the FY 2018 Budget, including fully funding \nsuppression at the 10-year average for both the Forest Service and DOI.  The Administration also \nappreciates the Committee\u2019s acceptance of the FY 2018 Budget proposal to move funding for the \nfirst eight hours of work per day out of fire suppression and into preparedness.  The \u201cbase 8\u201d \nshift moves the Forest Service to a more accurate and accountable budget approach that is \nconsistent with DOI, with salaries for all firefighters planned for in full. \n \nUSDA \n \nForest Service Land Acquisition.  The Administration objects to the increase in funding provided \nin the bill to increase land acquisition by $18 million over the FY 2018 Budget request.  The \nForest Service currently manages 193 million acres, has a deferred infrastructure maintenance \nbacklog of over $5 billion, and would be better served if its scarce resources were focused on \nimproved management of existing assets and lands. \n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n \nState Revolving Funds (SRFs).  While the Administration appreciates the attention paid to critical \nwater infrastructure needs through the funding provided to the Water Infrastructure and Finance \nInnovation Act credit program, the Administration is disappointed in the reduction to the Clean \nWater SRF.  Infrastructure investment is a priority for the Administration and the bill level of \n$1.1 billion for the SRF, which is $250 million lower than the FY 2018 Budget request, would \nresult in less funding going to States to finance critical wastewater and storm water infrastructure \ninvestments.  \n \nOther Independent Agencies  \n \nSmithsonian Institution (Institution).  The Administration urges the Congress to fund the \nSmithsonian Facilities Capital account at the $228 million requested in the FY 2018 Budget.  \nThe National Air and Space Museum (NASM) is in critical need of repair, and funding the \nNASM project within the level provided by the bill would force the Institution to divert funding \nfrom its Facilities Capital budget, leaving the Institution with insufficient funding for the many \nother important safety, security, and critical infrastructure projects planned for FY 2018.  \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 403, 409, and \nother provisions raise separation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of \nfunds upon approval by committees of the Congress. \n \n \n \n \n2 \n  Division B \u2013 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, 2018 \n \nRural Economic Infrastructure Grant Program.  The Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s \nsupport for rural America through the establishment of the Rural Economic Infrastructure Grant \nProgram, for which the bill provides $123 million, with a $60 million set-aside for projects in \nAppalachia. \n \nRural Broadband Loan Program.  The Administration welcomes the bill\u2019s support of high-speed \ninternet in rural America through the $27 million in loans made available under the Rural \nBroadband Loan Program.  \n \nFood Safety.  The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the FY 2018 Budget \nrequest for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which would help ensure that all meat, \npoultry, and egg products are safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. \n \nCredit for Farmers.  The Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s support for farmers through \nthe bill\u2019s $7 billion for Farm Service Agency direct and guaranteed farm ownership and \noperating loans. \n \nRural Development Programs.  The Administration is concerned that the bill misses an \nopportunity to reduce duplicative spending by funding Rural Business-Cooperative Service \nprograms, the direct loan and grant program for water and wastewater, as well as single family \nhousing direct loans.  The Small Business Administration\u2019s loan program, EPA\u2019s State \nRevolving Funds, Federal housing loan guarantees, and the private sector can effectively meet \nthe demands for these programs.  \n \nMcGovern-Dole International Food for Education Program (McGovern-Dole).  The \nAdministration is concerned that the bill provides $202 million in funding for McGovern-Dole, \nwhich the FY 2018 Budget proposes for elimination.  McGovern-Dole is duplicative of U.S. \nAgency for International Development (USAID) programs, is being ineffectively implemented, \nand has unaddressed oversight and performance monitoring challenges. \n \nP.L. 480 Title II Food Aid (Title II).  The Administration opposes providing food aid funding \nthrough use of Title II and prefers that all food aid be provided through the International Disaster \nAssistance account in USAID.  While the United States is the world\u2019s largest donor of food aid, \ntaxpayers expect such aid to be provided in the most cost-effective manner possible.  \nUnfortunately, Title II is cost-inefficient, slow, and limits the ability of USAID to use the most \nappropriate food aid intervention for a particular crisis. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, section 716 would \nviolate the Recommendation Clause; sections 702, 706, 717, 727, and other provisions raise \nseparation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of funds upon approval \nby committees of the Congress; and section 719 would interfere with the President\u2019s Take Care \n3 \n  authority to supervise the Executive Branch. \nDivision C \u2013 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 \nDepartment of Commerce \nCensus Bureau.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s strong support of the 2020 Decennial \nCensus and other periodic programs.  The Administration continues to assess the progress of \nplanning and preparing for a modern and improved 2020 Census and looks forward to working \nclosely with the Congress in order to deliver an accurate and on-time decennial census while \nefficiently using taxpayer resources.  \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Polar Follow On (PFO) Program.  \nThe Administration is concerned that the bill only provides $50 million of the $180 million \nrequested for NOAA\u2019s PFO weather satellite.  Insufficient funding for this program could \nincrease both the cost of procurement in future years and the risk that critical weather forecasting \ndata would be unavailable after the current generation of satellites reach the end of their \noperational lives.  \nNOAA Fisheries Disaster Assistance.  The Administration opposes the bill\u2019s $20 million in \nunrequested funds for commercial fisheries that received disaster declarations in FY 2017.  \nBusinesses affected by these fishery disasters have access to assistance through other \nGovernment programs, such as the Small Business Administration\u2019s disaster loan program. \nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) \nImmigration Judge Teams (IJ Teams).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided in \nthe bill for the Executive Office for Immigration Review to hire an additional 65 IJ Teams that \nwould support efforts to efficiently and effectively adjudicate cases, including reducing the \ncurrent case backlog.  \nState and Local Grants.  The Administration appreciates the overall support provided by the bill \nto DOJ\u2019s State and local law enforcement assistance grants.  The Administration urges the \nCongress, however, to restore stand-alone funding for the Community Oriented Policing \nServices Hiring Program, currently provided for under the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant \nprogram, and eliminate funding for the unrequested and unauthorized State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program.  \nState and Local Information Sharing.  The Administration has previously stated its support for \nH.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and urges the Congress to also include section \n219 of the FY 2018 Budget request in the appropriations bill.  The amendments proposed by \nsection 219 would prevent State and local government officials from prohibiting or restricting \nany law enforcement entity or official from complying with a lawful civil immigration detainer \nrequest, and would authorize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and DOJ to make \nFederal grant awards subject to State and local cooperation with immigration enforcement \nactivities and requests. \n4  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) \nOverall NASA Funding.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for \nNASA.  Extending the Nation\u2019s leadership in space is important and the NASA programs funded \nby this bill would help the Nation meet future challenges.  \nScience.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for NASA Science, but is \nconcerned that funding additional flagship missions in FY 2018 would place significant \npressure on the Science budget in future years as these missions ramp up and compete with \nother priorities.  The FY 2018 Budget request for NASA Science reflects a balanced portfolio \nthat is consistent with direction from the Decadal Survey for each discipline.\nNational Space Council (NSpC) \nNSpC Funding. The Administration has revived the National Space Council, which is tasked \nwith advising and assisting the President regarding national space policy and strategy.  The \nAdministration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to provide funding for the \nSpace Council as a separate office within the Executive Office of the President.  \nNational Science Foundation (NSF) \nNSF Funding.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides $7.3 billion for NSF, which \nis $687 million above the FY 2018 Budget request.  The request focuses funding on NSF\u2019s core \nresearch programs and undoes some of the large increases to programs that occurred during the \nprevious administration. \nConstitutional Concerns \nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 518 and 529 \nwould intrude upon the President\u2019s constitutional authority to negotiate international agreements \nand conduct international diplomacy. \nDivision D \u2013 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2018 \nDepartment of the Treasury \nTerrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) Funding.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support for TFI.  The Department of the Treasury programs that freeze the accounts \nof terrorists and proliferators, implement sanctions on rogue nations, and link law enforcement \nagencies with financial institutions are critical to the continued safety and financial stability of \nthe Nation.  Further, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure \nsupport for the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC), a key outcome from the President\u2019s \nsummit in Saudi Arabia.  The TFTC would enhance cooperation with Gulf countries in the fight \nagainst terrorism, and counter Iran\u2019s malign influence.  \n5  General Services Administration (GSA) \nOverall GSA Funding.  The FY 2018 Budget request for GSA includes a number of new funding \nmechanisms to facilitate Government streamlining and modernization.  The Administration urges \nthe Congress to support these initiatives, which either have been recently authorized by the \nCongress or are being actively pursued legislatively. \nTechnology Modernization Fund (TMF).  The bill does not include $228 million requested for \nthe TMF to retire and replace antiquated legacy information technology (IT) systems.  The TMF \nis an important step in changing the way the Federal Government manages its IT portfolio by \nestablishing a central mechanism designed to improve management and oversight with resources \ndedicated to IT modernization, moving agencies to more secure and efficient IT systems, and \ninfrastructure.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to provide the \nnecessary funding for the TMF as the authorizing legislation moves forward. \nFederal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC).  The bill does not include $9 million \nfor FPISC to execute its statutory mission outlined under Title 41 of the Fixing America\u2019s \nSurface Transportation Act.  Ensuring that the Federal environmental review and permitting \nprocess for infrastructure projects is coordinated, predictable, and transparent is a top priority of \nthe Administration. \nAsset Management and Space Proceeds Fund (AMSPF).  The Administration appreciates that the \nCommittee has provided resources to stand up the Public Buildings Reform Board authorized \nunder the Federal Asset Sales and Transfer Act.  The Administration, however, urges the \nCongress to fund the AMSPF at the requested level of $40 million, which would help carry out \nthe recommendations of the Board to dispose of unneeded Federal property and improve \nefficiency.  \nFederal Buildings Fund (FBF) Capital Program.  The Administration objects to the diversion of \nmore than $2 billion in FBF rent proceeds from investment in the capital program.  The bill \neliminates all funding for the construction and major renovation programs, and significantly \nunderfunds both the minor repair and maintenance and special emphasis programs. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) \nOPM IT Modernization.  The Administration welcomes the $18 million in funding provided in \nthe bill to fund important IT modernization improvements at OPM.  At the same time, the \nAdministration urges the Congress to fully fund the $37 million included in the FY 2018 Budget \nrequest for this purpose.  It is vital that OPM has the resources necessary to fund modernization \nof its IT systems, including its financial and retirement servicing systems.  These resources are \nnecessary to defend against increasingly advanced cyber threats.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to ensure OPM is capable of meeting these needs.  \n6  Other \n \nFinancial Regulatory Reform.  The Administration commends the Committee for moving \nfinancial reform legislation through the Congress.  The Administration is committed to \nreforming the Nation\u2019s financial system, as demonstrated by Executive Order 13772, Core \nPrinciples for Regulating the United States Financial System, and the Department of the \nTreasury\u2019s ensuing review.  The bill reflects the Administration\u2019s Core Principles in several key \nrespects.  In particular, the bill would provide regulatory relief to community financial \ninstitutions and rein in the unchecked authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  \nHowever, the Administration is concerned with section 632 of the bill, which would impede the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission\u2019s ability to investigate and uncover securities fraud by \ninhibiting its access to the content of electronic communications from internet service providers.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact legislation that supports \nthe Core Principles. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 101, 118, 119, \n122, 123, 201, 302, 511, 520, 608, 609, 717, 729, 738, 803, 815, and other provisions raise \nseparation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of funds upon approval \nby committees of the Congress; and provisions in title II under the heading \u201cOffice of \nManagement and Budget\u2014Salaries and Expenses\u201d would interfere with the President\u2019s \nconstitutional authority to supervise and direct the Executive Branch. \n \nDivision E \u2013 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 \n \nBorder Wall.  The Administration greatly appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the fully \nfunded border wall proposal, which is a critical element of the Administration\u2019s strategy to \nsecure the borders.  Physical barriers are vital for border security because they deter, prevent, and \ndeny potential illegal border crossings for illegal alien movement generally, and for human \nsmuggling and drug smuggling specifically.  The $1.6 billion provided by H.R. 3219, which is \nexpected to be incorporated into the bill, is for physical barrier construction along the southwest \nborder in the areas with the highest current risk and the greatest current operational need, \nincluding $784 million for 32 miles of new border fencing in Rio Grande Valley (RGV), Texas, \n$498 million for 28 miles of new levee wall in RGV, and $251 million for 14 miles of secondary \nfencing in San Diego, California. \n \nStrengthening Immigration Enforcement.  The Administration greatly appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support for the FY 2018 Budget request to strengthen immigration enforcement, \nincluding by hiring immigration law enforcement officers and agents and by increasing \nimmigration detention capacity.  Additional resources for these efforts would help to ensure \nincreased border security, the apprehension, detention, and removal of dangerous aliens from the \nNation\u2019s streets, and the disruption and dismantling of human smuggling and trafficking \nactivities conducted by transnational criminal organizations.  \n \n \n7 \n  State and Local Information Sharing.  The Administration has previously stated its support for \nH.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and urges the Congress to also include section \n523 of the FY 2018 Budget request in the appropriations bill.  The amendments proposed by \nsection 523 would prevent State and local government officials from prohibiting or restricting \nany law enforcement entity or official from complying with a lawful civil immigration detainer \nrequest, and would authorize DHS and DOJ to make Federal grant awards subject to State and \nlocal cooperation with immigration enforcement activities and requests.  The Administration is \ncommitted to strengthening enforcement of the Nation\u2019s immigration laws in order to improve \nnational security and public safety.  This proposal is critical to these efforts. \n \nStatute of Limitations for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance \nRecoveries.  The Administration objects to section 540 of the bill, which changes the three-year \nstatute of limitations for recovery of FEMA disaster assistance grants provided to State or local \ngovernments.  Section 540 of the bill would amend the recovery action timeline to begin when \nan individual project is completed, instead of when a recipient (or sub-recipient) has completed \nall work for a disaster or emergency.  The Administration understands that State and local \nrecovery efforts are important; but it is also important for FEMA to have adequate time to \nproperly review recovery expenditures and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately. \n \nU.S. Secret Service Staffing.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for Secret \nService hiring.  The bill fully supports the FY 2018 Budget request to increase Secret Service \nstaffing by over 300 agents, officers, and professional staff, which would enable the agency to \naddress chronic staffing shortfalls and reach a sustainable staffing level. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nSection 509 of the bill raises separation of powers concerns because it purports to condition the \nuse of appropriated funds upon approval by committees of the Congress. \n \nDivision F \u2013 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 \n \nDepartment of Labor \n \nApprenticeship.  The Administration strongly opposes the elimination of funding for \napprenticeship grants.  Apprenticeships equip workers with the skills needed to compete and \nallow workers to earn while they learn.  Terminating the apprenticeships initiative would hinder \nefforts to allow more workers and employers to benefit from this proven model that closes the \nskills gap.  \n \nOffice of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS).  The bill does not provide OLMS with the \nresources necessary to protect union members from corruption.  The previous administration \nallowed employment in OLMS to fall by one-third, severely impeding the Agency\u2019s ability to \ninvestigate and prosecute financial misconduct in labor organizations.  The Administration \nbelieves the $47 million requested in the FY 2018 Budget would provide better protection for \nAmerica\u2019s workers. \n8 \n  Department of Health and Human Services \n \nIndirect Cost Restriction.  The Administration is disappointed by language included in section \n228 of the bill, which prohibits changes to the method the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \nuses to pay grantee institutions for administrative and facilities costs.  Further, the \nAdministration is strongly opposed to any attempts to prohibit NIH or any other Agency staff \nfrom developing strategies to make Government programs more effective and efficient.   \n \nDepartment of Education \n \nTitle I and Public School Choice Grants.  The Administration opposes the omission of increased \nfunding for Title I, which would provide supplemental awards to school districts that decide to \nprovide more educational options to students.  This would allow students to benefit from Federal, \nState, and local funds to attend the public school of their choice.  The FY 2018 Budget request \nincludes $1 billion to support a public school choice proposal for all students and give \ndisadvantaged students from low-income areas the opportunity to attend a quality K-12 school.  \n \nEducation, Innovation and Research (EIR) and School Choice.  The Administration opposes the \nlack of funding for the EIR program, including the $250 million requested to expand and \nevaluate the effectiveness and opportunities provided through private school choice programs \nacross the Nation.  EIR supports the expansion of innovative and proven approaches to improve \nAmerica\u2019s education system, address persistent challenges in education, and build institutional \nknowledge of what is working. \n \nSupporting Effective Instruction State Grants.  The Administration supports the elimination of \nSupporting Effective Instruction State Grants, as proposed in the FY 2018 Budget request and as \nreflected in the bill.  These grants are poorly targeted and funds are spread too thinly to have a \nmeaningful impact on student outcomes. There are better ways to use funding to effectively \nassist students and to support those who need it most. \n \nSocial Security Administration (SSA) \n \nSSA Limitation on Administrative Expenses.  The Administration supports the funding level \nprovided for SSA\u2019s administrative budget.  The bill funds dedicated program integrity activities \nat $1.7 billion, including funding the fully authorized cap adjustment level of $1.5 billion.  \nProgram integrity activities are crucial to ensuring only eligible individuals receive social \nsecurity benefits. \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nInstitute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).  The Administration opposes funding of the \nIMLS.  The bill provides $231 million for IMLS, whereas the FY 2018 Budget requested \n$23 million to close down IMLS.  IMLS\u2019s funding supplements State, local, and private funds, \nwhich provide the vast majority of funding to museums and libraries.  In addition, authorization \nof appropriations for this Agency expired in FY 2016.  \n \n9 \n  Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).  The Administration objects to the FY 2020 funding \nlevel provided for CPB through the two-year advance appropriation.  The FY 2018 Budget \nrequest proposes eliminating Federal funding for CPB by FY 2019 and proposes rescinding all but \n$30 million of the FY 2018 appropriation.  CPB grants represent a small share of the total funding \nfor the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio and the Administration believes \nprivate donations would be sufficient to fund these operations.  \n \nDivision G \u2013 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs \nAppropriations Act, 2018 \n \nDepartment of State and Other International Programs \n \nOverseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Administration commends the Committee for \nsupporting the proposal in the FY 2018 Budget to begin reining in the excessive expansion of \nOCO for the Department of State and USAID (State/USAID), and would oppose an OCO \nfunding level higher than $12 billion.  OCO funding for State/USAID began as a tool to provide \nfor the temporary and extraordinary costs related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but has \nbeen distorted to serve as a back-door means of circumventing the cap on non-defense \ndiscretionary spending.  \n \nDepartment of the Treasury Contributions to Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs).  The \nAdministration strongly opposes the over $600 million reduction to the FY 2018 Budget request \nfor the Department\u2019s contributions to the MDBs.  The decreases in the bill to the World Bank\u2019s \nInternational Development Association and the African Development Fund are particularly \nproblematic, as the requested funding level would support development in some of the world\u2019s \npoorest countries by leveraging funding from other donors.  This major reduction would upset \nthe delicate balance needed to maintain United States leadership at these institutions while \nensuring that other donors pay their fair share.  \n \nEliminations and Reductions.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee adopted some \nof the reductions proposed in the FY 2018 Budget, including eliminating funding for the East-\nWest Center, the International Organizations and Programs, and the Complex Crises Fund \naccounts, and for contributions to the Green Climate Fund and the Global Agriculture and Food \nSecurity Program.  Furthermore, funding could be restored for Treasury International Programs \nby supporting the other eliminations and reductions requested in the FY 2018 Budget.  The \nprograms proposed for termination are not critical to the conduct of United States foreign policy \nand often duplicate the efforts of other Federal programs or the non-profit and private sectors.  \n \nForeign Military Financing (FMF).  The Administration appreciates that the Committee supports \nFMF programs including assistance to Israel, but is concerned that the bill does not provide the \nrequested authority to provide FMF loans.  FMF loans offer the opportunity to further support \nthe United States industrial base while promoting burden sharing via direct loans rather than \ngrants to foreign partners. \n \nExport-Import Bank (Bank) Board Quorum Waiver.  The Administration opposes the inclusion \nof language that would effectively waive the requirement that the Export-Import Bank have at \n10 \n  least three board members to constitute a quorum.  The Administration urges the Congress to act \non the Administration\u2019s pending nominees to the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors and restore the \nBank\u2019s full operating authority, rather than circumvent the confirmation process.  \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, a proviso in title I under \nthe heading \u201cDepartment of State\u2014International Organizations\u2014Contributions for International \nPeacekeeping Activities\u201d would infringe upon the President\u2019s authority as Commander-in-Chief \nand over the conduct of diplomacy; although the Administration shares the policy views in \nsection 7070, that provision would interfere with the President\u2019s authority to recognize foreign \ngovernments and conduct diplomacy; and numerous provisions, including provisions in sections \n7013, 7025, 7029, 7031, 7037, 7041, 7042, 7043, and 7071 would infringe upon the President\u2019s \nauthority to conduct diplomacy and receive foreign diplomats. \n \nDivision H \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2018 \n \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) \n \nInfrastructure Investment.  The FY 2018 Budget supports a new vision for infrastructure \ninvestment in the Nation with a focused role for the Federal Government\u2014streamlining \nburdensome approval processes and incentivizing more investment by rewarding States and \nlocalities that support infrastructure projects and maintain them over the long term.  The bill, \nhowever, includes unrequested funding for Capital Investment Grants, Essential Air Service, and \nAmtrak contrary to reforms proposed in the FY 2018 Budget.  These reforms would respectively, \nlimit funding for local transit projects that should be funded by States and localities that benefit \nfrom their use, eliminate discretionary funding and focus on remote airports that are most in need \nof subsidized commercial air service, and terminate Federal support for long-distance train \nservices that serve a small percentage of the population and generate significant operating losses. \n \nTIGER Grants.  The Administration appreciates that the bill supports the FY 2018 Budget \nrequest to eliminate funding for TIGER Grants, given that Federal funding should not be directed \nto projects with localized benefits that often do not rise to the level of national or regional \nsignificance. \n \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n \nRental Assistance.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of HUD rental \nassistance to low-income families.  However, the bill funds rental assistance programs at \n$38.5 billion, which is $3.3 billion above the FY 2018 Budget request, ignoring reforms to put \nrental assistance on a more sustainable fiscal path while also continuing to assist current \nresidents, encouraging work, and promoting self-sufficiency.  \n \nHUD IT.  The Administration is concerned that HUD would be unable to maintain IT current \nservices or invest in needed IT improvements, as the bill provides $150 million for IT\u2014\n11 \n  $100 million below the FY 2018 Budget request. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 221, 230, 287, \n406 would raise separation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of \nfunds upon approval by committees of the Congress. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2018 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n12 \n  ", "     \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT   \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \n \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n \n \nFebruary 7, 2017 \n(House) \n \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.J.

The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the \nCongressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on \nStates, local communities, and institutions of higher education. \n \nH.J.

Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department \nof Labor.  The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by \nStates when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested.  The rule  imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct \na drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-\n96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.   \n \nH.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. \nReg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land \nManagement (BLM).  This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize \nregional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for \nactivities on public lands.  The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located \nmostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy \nand mineral development.  Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes \nthe rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities\u2019 interests and could \npotentially dilute their input in planning decisions. \n \nH.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as \nAmended by the Every Student Succeeds Act \u2013 Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed.

This rule establishes \nrequirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have \nan accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student \nsuccess, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student \nprogress.  While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local \ncontrol of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas \nwhere the ESSA intended broad flexibility.  The Administration looks forward to working with \nthe Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they \nimplement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \n \nH.J. Res. 58 would nullify the final rule related to the Teacher Preparation Program \nAccountability System, 81 Fed. Reg. 75494 (Oct. 31, 2016), promulgated by the Department of \nEducation.  This rule establishes annual State reporting to measure the performance and quality \nof teacher preparation programs and tie them to program eligibility for participation in the \nTeacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program.

Roberts, R-Kansas) \nThe Administration appreciates the work of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \nCommittee to reauthorize the farm bill in a timely manner to provide support to our Nation\u2019s \nfarm and rural communities.   \nIn particular, the Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s adoption of some of the reforms \nproposed in the President\u2019s Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget for the United States Department of \nAgriculture (USDA).  The bill moves in the right direction to tighten existing income limits for \neligibility for some farm subsidies from $900,000 to $700,000, but the Administration urges the \nSenate to go further in reducing the income limit.  The bill would also adopt market-based \ninterest rates for electric and telecommunication loan borrowers, thus removing unnecessary \nsubsidies.  \nThe Administration encourages the Senate to include more farm safety net reforms from the FY \n2019 Budget for USDA that would better target payments to farmers who need them most. \nThe bill misses key opportunities to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \n(SNAP).  Most notably, the bill does not strengthen work requirements for able-bodied working \nage adults.  The bill also fails to close eligibility loopholes and target benefits to the neediest \nhouseholds as proposed in the President\u2019s Budgets for FY 2018 and FY 2019.  It also fails to \nbetter align SNAP Employment and Training with other Federal workforce programs.  \nThe bill lacks meaningful regulatory reform, and the Administration opposes dozens of \nadditional burdensome requirements for new reports, studies, and pilots.  \nThe Administration is concerned that the bill does not incorporate any of the conservation \nprogram changes proposed in the FY 2019 Budget that prioritized funding for programs that \nhave shown positive outcomes while eliminating funding for those programs with limited \noutcomes.  Unfortunately, the bill would also reverse streamlining improvements that were made \nin the conservation title of the 2014 farm bill and instead expand conservation programs through \nincreased Conservation Reserve Program acreage caps and the introduction of multiple new \nprograms.   The Administration would support a reform of P.L. 480 Title II food aid that maximizes \nresources in responding to global food crises while promoting food security.  The current bill \ndoes not include meaningful reforms. \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry Committee to address these and other issues with the farm bill as the process moves \nforward.  \n* * * * * * * ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nMay 15, 2018 \n(House) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nS. 2372\u2014John S. McCain III, Daniel K. Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining \nInternal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Networks Act of 2018, \n or the VA MISSION Act of 2018 \n(Rep. Roe, R-TN, and 21 cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of S. 2372, the VA MISSION Act of 2018. \nThis legislation would fundamentally transform elements of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) healthcare system, fulfill the President\u2019s commitment to provide veterans with more choice \nin their healthcare providers and prevent a funding shortfall in the current Veterans Choice \nProgram (Choice Program).  The bill is the product of months of work between the legislative \nand executive branches, and reflects an agreement reached between the Administration and key \nleaders in the House and Senate. \nThe VA MISSION Act would consolidate VA\u2019s community care programs into a new Veterans \nCommunity Care Program.  This new program would strengthen the VA by merging the \nDepartment\u2019s tangled web of competing and confusing community care programs, including the \nChoice Program, into one system that is easier to navigate for veterans, VA employees, and \ncommunity partners.  It will help to ensure that veterans choose the VA by getting them the right \ncare at the right time with the right provider.  Additionally, unifying funding for the new VA \ncommunity care program by using discretionary resources will increase transparency and \naccountability. \nThe Administration estimates that funding for the current Choice Program could be exhausted as \nearly as May 31, 2018.  This bill provides $5.2 billion in mandatory funding for the Choice \nProgram, which the Administration expects to be sufficient for the program to continue to \nprovide care to veterans until the new, consolidated Veterans Community Care Program is \noperational\u2014approximately one year after enactment of this bill.  If this bill were enacted, the \nChoice Program should not require any additional mandatory funding. \nS. 2372 would expand eligibility for the VA\u2019s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family \nCaregivers, which promotes and enhances veteran wellbeing through the provision of \nunprecedented services and support to caregivers of veterans who require the care and assistance \nof another.  Post-9/11 veterans have benefitted greatly from this program.  The bill would end a \ndisparity in veterans\u2019 benefits by expanding the program to include eligible veterans from all eras \nof service.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that \nadequate funding is provided for this expansion. \nThe VA\u2019s ability to effectively and efficiently manage its real property portfolio is a critical \ncomponent of operating a high-performing and integrated healthcare system.  The asset and   \n \ninfrastructure review process in S. 2372 would provide the VA with the necessary flexibility to \nalign its infrastructure footprint with the needs of our Nation\u2019s veterans.  The VA will also \nbenefit greatly from the provisions that strengthen its ability to recruit and retain quality \nhealthcare professionals.  \n \nPresident Trump has been\u2014and will continue to be\u2014a champion for America\u2019s veterans.  The \nAdministration is proud of the steps that it already has taken to improve accountability and \ntransparency at the VA.  Enacting the VA MISSION Act will strengthen the VA\u2019s ability to \ndeliver timely, high-quality healthcare in its own facilities, while ensuring seamless integration \nwith community care providers.  This will result in a 21st century system that offers our veterans \nthe highest level of care in both VA facilities and the community.  \nThe Administration urges the House and Senate to pass this critical legislation by Memorial Day \nto ensure that veterans can continue to receive care through the Choice Program without \ndisruption. \nIf the VA MISSION Act of 2018 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors \nwould recommend that he sign it into law. \n \n* * * * * * \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n) \nMarch 13, 2017\n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.J.

Frelinghuysen, R-NJ) \nThe Administration appreciates investments that H.R. 6147, making appropriations for interior, \nenvironment, financial services and general government for the fiscal year (FY) ending \nSeptember 30, 2019, and for other purposes, makes in the Nation\u2019s natural resources, financial \ninfrastructure, and Government operations. \nThe Administration welcomes the House\u2019s timely consideration of appropriations legislation, \nand looks forward to working with the Congress well before the end of the fiscal year to enact \nindividual bills that provide sufficient funding to essential programs without further jeopardizing \nthe Nation\u2019s fiscal state. \nDivision A of H.R. 6147 provides funding for programs requested in the FY 2019 Budget, such \nas energy development, National Park Service construction, and wildland fire response.  The \nAdministration appreciates the support for these and other priorities, such as critical water \ninfrastructure needs funded through both the State Revolving Funds and the Water Infrastructure \nFinance and Innovation Act credit program.  However, division A funds numerous programs at \nlevels well above the FY 2019 Budget request, and does not include major recommended \nreductions.  Division A is $7 billion\u2014approximately 25 percent\u2014above the FY 2019 request, \nand the EPA alone is funded at almost $2 billion above the Administration\u2019s requested level. \nThe Administration greatly appreciates the efforts made in division B to reduce Federal spending \nbelow the non-Defense discretionary cap level set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA).  \nThe Fund for America\u2019s Kids and Grandkids, which reserves funds until the Federal budget \ndeficit is erased, is a novel and commendable effort towards fiscal responsibility.  Given the \nNation\u2019s long-term fiscal constraints and the need to right-size the Federal Government, the \nAdministration encourages the Congress to continue identifying ways to reduce spending below \nthe BBA non-Defense discretionary cap.  Division B also supports the Administration\u2019s priorities \nincluding countering terrorist financing, implementing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, \nprotecting life and religious liberty in Washington, D.C., and fundamentally reforming the \nBureau of Consumer Financial Protection. \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nHouse Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill.  Division A \u2013 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2019 \n \nDepartment of the Interior (DOI) \n \nDOI Topline.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for priority DOI programs, \nhowever, it also provides increased funding in excess of the FY 2019 Budget request for a \nnumber of DOI programs.  In total, the bill provides an estimated $13.1 billion for DOI, $2.4 \nbillion more than the FY 2019 Budget request. \n \nEnergy Development.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s commitment to energy \ndevelopment on public lands and in offshore waters, including additional resources above the \nFY 2019 Budget request in the Bureaus of Land Management, Ocean Energy Management, and \nSafety and Environmental Enforcement. \n \nNational Park Service (NPS) Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s \nstrong support for NPS construction, and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress \nto address the NPS deferred maintenance backlog. \n \nDOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service \n \nWildland Fire Management.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s $3.9 billion investment in \nwildland fire operations, fully funding the 10-year average for wildland fire suppression costs for \nboth the Forest Service and DOI.  The Administration also appreciates the additional funds \nprovided in the bill to cover suppression costs above the 10-year average, which would help in \nthe year before wildfire cap adjustment funds become available. \n \nFederal Land Acquisition.  The Administration opposes funding provided in the bill for land \nacquisition, which is $124 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Departments \ncurrently manage roughly 700 million acres and have a deferred maintenance infrastructure \nbacklog of over $16 billion.  Acquiring new lands, however, is a low priority. \n \nUSDA, Forest Service \n \nUSDA, Forest Service Topline.  The Administration is concerned that funding for non-fire \nprograms is $960 million above the FY 2019 Budget request, with large increases for facilities \nand roads, and for State and Private Forestry grants. \n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n \nEPA Topline.  The Administration is concerned that the bill would provide $8.3 billion for EPA, \nwhich is $2.2 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request, and includes funding for programs that \nare outside of the Agency\u2019s core responsibilities. \n \nFunding for Water Infrastructure.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s attention to \ncritical water infrastructure needs through the robust funding provided to both the State \n2 \n  Revolving Funds and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act credit program.  \nCombined, this funding could support several billion dollars in total water infrastructure \ninvestment for a wide variety of needs.   \n \nSuperfund.  The Administration appreciates the $1.2 billion included in the bill for the Hazardous \nSubstance Superfund account, which would support infrastructure projects and ongoing cleanup \nof contaminated sites that are impacting the health and economic well-being of communities. \n \nEPA Geographic Programs.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides $398 million \nabove the FY 2019 Budget request for the Geographic Programs, which perform local ecosystem \nprotection activities, much of which is more appropriately funded by State and local entities. \n \nCategorical Grants.  The Administration continues to recommend reductions to Categorical \nGrants, which the bill would fund at $469 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  \nReductions to these grants would reduce Federal funding for State activities that go beyond \nstatutory mandates, and would encourage a rebalancing of environmental program funding \nbetween Federal and State resources. \n \nEPA\u2019s Science and Technology Account.  The Administration continues to advocate for \nreductions in the Science and Technology account, which is funded at $644 million or \n$220 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  This account includes programs in research \nand development that are not necessary to implement core EPA responsibilities. \n \nDiesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) Grant Program.  The bill provides $100 million, or $90 \nmillion above the FY 2019 Budget request for the DERA grant program.  While the \nAdministration supports limited DERA funding for targeted high-priority projects, DERA \nprojects overlap with other Federal and State programs, and have diminishing returns for older \nvehicles that would eventually be replaced regardless of DERA grant funding levels.  States may \nalso be able to use some of a $2.7 billion fund established through a settlement with Volkswagen \nto support very similar projects to those normally funded by the DERA program. \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nNational Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and \nthe Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (Wilson Center).  The Administration is \ndisappointed that the bill does not eliminate Federal funding for NEA, NEH, and Wilson Center.  \nThe Administration recognizes the positive effects the arts and humanities have on our \ncommunities; however the FY 2019 Budget request proposed an orderly phase-out of Federal \nfunding for these agencies, as the Administration does not consider their activities to be core \nFederal responsibilities. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns by contravening the separation of \npowers between the Executive Branch and the Congress.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking with the Congress to address these concerns. \n3 \n   \nDivision B \u2013 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019 \n \nDepartment of the Treasury \n \nThe Fund for America\u2019s Kids and Grandkids (Fund).  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s inclusion of the Fund in the bill.  The Fund is an example of how the Congress can \nsafeguard funds for future generations and spend below the discretionary caps in a time of \nexcessive deficits. \n \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS).  The bill provides the IRS a total of $11.6 billion, $482 million \nabove the FY 2019 Budget request.  This amount includes $77 million in dedicated funding for \ntax reform implementation and base funding for tax enforcement that is $232 million above the \nFY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for tax \nreform and the amounts provided in the bill fully fund the Administration\u2019s two-year proposal \nrequested in FY 2018.  While the Administration supports additional investment in tax \nenforcement and the resulting deficit savings, the program integrity cap adjustment proposed in \nthe FY 2019 Budget would be a more appropriate way to fund these activities. \n \nOffice of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).  The bill provides TFI a total of \n$161 million, $2 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support for TFI to continue its critical work safeguarding the financial system from \nabuse and combatting other national security threats using non-kinetic economic tools. \n \nTreasury Departmental Offices.  The bill provides $209 million for Treasury\u2019s Departmental \nOffices, $7 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  These additional funds could be used to \nstrengthen review of foreign investment in the United States and address other emerging \npriorities.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to provide adequate \nresources to support anticipated increases in the caseload for review by the Committee on \nForeign Investment in the United States. \n \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The bill provides $216 million, \n$202 million above the FY 2019 Budget request, for the CDFI Fund.  The requested amount is \nsufficient to support ongoing CDFI Fund activities, including the New Markets Tax Credit and \nthe zero-subsidy Bond Guarantee Program. \n \nBureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP).  The Administration encourages the Congress to \ninclude language in the final FY 2019 bill that would allow BEP to purchase land and construct a \nnew currency production facility in the National Capital Region.  This authority would save the \nFederal Government approximately $600 million and would lower the operating costs associated \nwith printing of our Nation\u2019s currency. \n \nExecutive Office of the President (EOP) \n \nInformation Technology Oversight and Reform (ITOR).  While the Administration appreciates \nthe Committee\u2019s support for the EOP, including a funding increase for the Office of \n4 \n  Management and Budget (OMB), the bill does not adequately fund the ITOR account.  To \nmaintain the ability of the OMB Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) to \nperform statutorily required IT oversight, policy development, and IT security functions and the \nU.S. Digital Service\u2019s ability to respond effectively to significant security breaches or recover \nfailed systems, the Administration urges the Congress to fund ITOR at the level requested in the \nFY 2019 Budget and to support the requested funding necessary to transition certain OFCIO \nactivities to the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy.  \n \nGeneral Services Administration (GSA) \n \nFederal Information Technology (IT) Modernization.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s attention to modernizing vulnerable and inefficient legacy IT systems and \nwelcomes the $150 million in continued support for the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) \nas a means of addressing these pressing challenges.  The Administration believes that any \nadditional funding would be well-utilized and will continue working with the Committee to \ndemonstrate the taxpayer value generated by the TMF. \n \nFederal Buildings Fund (FBF) Capital Program.  The Administration is concerned that the bill \ndiverts more than $1.5 billion in FBF rent receipts from investment in the capital program.  The \nbill eliminates essential funding for priority construction, acquisition, and repair and alteration \nprojects such as the purchase of the Department of Transportation headquarters. \n \nFederal Capital Revolving Fund.  The Administration continues to support the establishment of a \nFederal Capital Revolving Fund (FCRF), a new budgetary mechanism for large civilian real \nproperty projects.  The Administration recently transmitted legislative language and looks \nforward to working with the Congress to enact the FCRF proposal. \n \nEnvironmental Review Improvement Fund.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee \nfully funds the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council at the level requested in the \nFY 2019 Budget, allowing the Council to create a more standardized, coordinated, and \npredictable permitting process that protects public health, safety, and the environment. \n \nWorkforce Fund.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact \nauthorizing legislation to establish the President\u2019s Management Council Workforce Fund and \nurges the Congress to provide appropriations upon its enactment.  The Administration believes it \nis essential to develop and fund innovative solutions aimed at recruiting, retaining, and \nrewarding high-performing Federal employees and those with critical skills sets. \n \nSmall Business Administration (SBA) \n \nDisaster Loans Program Account.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides \ninsufficient funding for SBA disaster loan administrative expenses, assuming instead that SBA \nwill rely on balances from appropriations provided in the Further Additional Supplemental \nAppropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-123, division B, \nsubdivision 1).  These balances are necessary to administer loans to those affected by the major \nhurricanes that occurred in 2017, and may not be sufficient to allow SBA to continue to provide \n5 \n  loans to disasters occurring in 2019.  The Administration believes it makes sense both fiscally \nand programmatically to provide funds through the regular appropriations process in order to \nensure that SBA has the necessary resources to quickly assist homeowners and businesses in \ndisaster recovery. \n \nOther Independent Agencies \n \nBureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau).  The Administration is encouraged by the \nCommittee\u2019s inclusion of language that would subject the Bureau to the normal appropriations \nprocess beginning in FY 2020, create a dedicated Inspector General, and authorize further \ncongressional review of the Bureau\u2019s rulemaking procedures.   \n \nDistrict of Columbia.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for provisions \nincluded in the FY 2019 Budget that protect life and religious liberty in Washington, D.C. \n \nOther Provisions \n \nFinancial Regulation.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s efforts to build on \nenactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (Public \nLaw 115-174) by proposing additional pro-growth provisions that would promote lending and \naccess to capital markets for American businesses, homeowners, and consumers.  The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to address several technical changes \nto facilitate enactment of these provisions, which support the core principles for regulating the \nUnited States financial system as set forth in Executive Order 13772. \n \nCriminal Warrant Requirement for Electronic Communications.  The Administration is \nconcerned with section 1002 of the bill, which would require Government entities to obtain a \ncriminal warrant when they seek the content of subscriber emails and other electronic \ncommunications from internet service providers.  This statutory change would have operational \nimpacts on civil law enforcement agencies that lack criminal authority, such as the Securities and \nExchange Commission, and would impede investigations. \n \nConstitutional Concerns \n \nCertain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  One provision would violate the \nAppointments Clause, and a number of others would contravene the separation of powers \nbetween the Executive Branch and the Congress.  In particular, certain provisions\u2014including \none purporting to bar OMB from expending funds to alter the annual work plan of the Army \nCorps of Engineers\u2014would interfere with the President\u2019s supervision of the Executive Branch.  \nOthers would require congressional committee approval of certain executive actions, in violation \nof INS v. Chadha, or could infringe on the President\u2019s constitutional authority to control the \ndisclosure of information that is subject to executive privilege.  The Administration looks \nforward to working with the Congress to address these concerns. \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2019 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n6 \n   \n* * * * * * * \n7 \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\n September 12, 2018 \n (House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 3798 \u2013 Save American Workers Act of 2018 \n(Rep. Walorski, R-IN, and 77 cosponsors) \nThe Administration supports H.R. 3798, the Save American Workers Act of 2018, which would \nrepeal, delay, or replace several harmful provisions of Obamacare.  Protecting American families \nfrom the prescriptive requirements and burdensome taxes imposed by Obamacare has been an \nAdministration priority from day one, and this bill would make substantial progress toward \nfulfilling President Donald J. Trump\u2019s promise to the American people.  The Administration \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare in a fiscally \nresponsible way that protects consumers, expands access to affordable, quality healthcare, and \nputs patients and doctors at the center of healthcare decisions.   \nWith premiums rising and insurance options dwindling across much of the country, health \ninsurance mandates impose heavy burdens on American families and businesses.  Earlier this \nyear, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, landmark tax reform that eliminated tax \npenalties on individuals for failing to carry health insurance.  As yet another positive outcome of \nthis change, H.R. 3798 would end the needless and wasteful requirement that companies send \nout annual certifications of insurance coverage to their employees.   \nH.R. 3798 also would continue this progress by delaying the employer mandate, which unfairly \npenalizes certain companies and costs countless American jobs.  The bill would further protect \nemployees by codifying the common understanding that full-time employment is 40 hours per \nweek.  The irresponsible and illogical 30-hour threshold set under Obamacare created a costly \ndilemma for employers faced with skyrocketing health insurance premiums, and caused many \nAmericans to have their hours cut.    \nIn addition, this bill would delay the so-called Cadillac Tax on high-cost health insurance \nplans.  Like several other Obamacare taxes, the Cadillac Tax has been delayed several times with \nbipartisan support.  Finally, H.R. 3798 would repeal Obamacare\u2019s excise tax on indoor tanning \nservices, yet another unnecessary and onerous tax unfairly targeting a specific industry and \nharming American consumers.  \nThe Save American Workers Act of 2018 would protect American jobs and businesses, put \nmoney back into the pockets of American taxpayers, and suspend taxes against certain health \ninsurance plans and businesses.  If H.R. 3798 were presented to the President in its current form, \nhis advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.  \n** * * * * * ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT\nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503\nJuly 12, 2017 \n(House)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 2430 \u2013 FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 \n(Rep. Walden, R-OR, and three cosponsors) \nThe Administration is committed to expanding access to safe and affordable drugs and medical \ndevices through timely reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the Medical Device \nUser Fee Amendments, the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments, and the Biosimilar User Fee Act.  \nH.R. 2430 would reauthorize these four Food and Drug Administration (FDA) user fee programs, \nunder which companies that develop drugs and medical devices partially pay for FDA's premarket \nreview of their products.  H.R. 2430 also includes a number of provisions to improve FDA's drug \nreview process, including greater use of real-world evidence and enhancing drug development tools \nsuch as biomarker development.  FDA's review activities are critical to promoting rapid access to \ninnovative therapies and driving competition toward better healthcare results and lower prices for \nAmerican consumers.  Improvements in FDA's premarket review process, funded by these user fee \nprograms, have encouraged drug and device makers to expand research and development, leading to \nadvances in medical technology that have saved and improved countless lives.  \nThe President's Budget promotes faster economic growth by lowering taxes and strategically \ndevoting resources to urgent priorities.  To better support FDA's lifesaving mission while carefully \nspending taxpayer dollars, the President's Budget asks companies that benefit directly from FDA's \npremarket review of medical products to finance 100 percent of FDA's premarket review.  In its \ncurrent form, H.R. 2430 would require significant investment of taxpayer resources in FDA's medical \nproduct review programs.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide for 100 percent user fee \nfunding within the reauthorized programs.  In an era of renewed fiscal restraint, industries that \nbenefit directly from FDA's work should pay for it.  \nThe Administration is also concerned with certain other provisions in the bill, such as those \nproviding additional market exclusivity to manufacturers, which could make exclusivity \nunpredictable and decrease competition.  The Administration is committed to promoting the \navailability of generics in an efficient and effective manner that avoids unintended, adverse \nconsequences.  In addition, there are a number of important technical changes that the Administration \nseeks to make to the bill, including adjusting the foreign drug facility inspection fee. \nThe Administration supports the goals of H.R. 2430 and looks forward to working with the Congress \nto expand access to affordable, lifesaving drugs and medical devices in a thoughtful manner that \nprotects taxpayer resources, promotes competition, improves healthcare outcomes, and stimulates \nscientific innovation and medical advances.  \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n) \nJuly 24, 2017 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3219 \u2014 Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018 \n(Rep.

The bill ensures our security abroad by funding operations to defeat the \nIslamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), rebuilding our military after years of neglect, and \nimproving our missile defense capabilities to defend against threats from North Korea and other \nadversaries.  It protects us at home by providing for construction of the border wall.  It also \nkeeps faith with those who defend us by generously funding care for our veterans.  In addition, \nthe bill makes major investments in our military and civilian infrastructure, supporting our \neconomy while improving our security.\nThe Administration strongly supports the Committee\u2019s commitment to include the President\u2019s \nborder wall proposal, which is a critical element of the President\u2019s strategy to secure the borders.  \nThis proposal provides $1.6 billion for physical barrier construction along the southwest border, \nincluding $784 million for 32 miles of new border fencing in Rio Grande Valley (RGV), Texas, \n$498 million for 28 miles of new levee wall in RGV, $251 million for 14 miles of secondary \nfencing in San Diego, California, and $38 million for program planning and management.  \nPhysical barriers are vital for border security because they deter, prevent, and deny potential \nillegal border crossings, for illegal alien movement generally and for human smuggling and drug \nsmuggling specifically.  The funding provided in the bill would allow Customs and Border \nProtection to make critical investments in the areas of the border with the highest current risk \nand the greatest current operational need.  The Administration strongly supports these efforts.\nThe bill provides $667.7 billion for the Department of Defense, including $74.6 billion for \nOverseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The previous administration signed into law harmful \ncuts to defense spending.  This Administration strongly supports restoring America\u2019s investment \nin defense.  To ensure that our military is not rebuilt on the backs of future generations of \nAmericans, however, the Administration strongly supports fiscally responsible reductions to \nspending elsewhere in the Federal Budget, as outlined in the FY 2018 Budget request.\nVeterans\u2019 access to timely, high-quality healthcare and services is a top priority, and the \nAdministration appreciates the bill\u2019s provision of $78.3 billion in discretionary funding for \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a $3.9 billion increase above FY 2017.  This funding \nsupports care for our veterans as well as crucial reforms to the VA to reduce the disability \nclaims backlog and provide greater oversight and accountability. If H.R. 3219 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend \nthat he sign the bill into law.  \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the \nCommittee\u2019s version of the bill.  The Administration may also provide more detail regarding its \nviews in the future, including constitutional concerns, on other provisions. \nDivision A \u2013 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018 \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) \nBase Realignment and Closure (BRAC).  The Administration strongly objects to section 8113, \nwhich prohibits the use of appropriated funds for proposing, planning, or executing a new BRAC \nround.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as \nrequested so that DOD can ensure it is not wasting resources on unneeded infrastructure.  The \nDepartment estimates that a new BRAC round in 2021 would save an additional $2 billion or \nmore annually\u2014resources it could apply to higher priorities such as readiness and \nmodernization.   \nPalau Compact Funding.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to include the \n$124 million requested to fulfill the entire remaining United States financial commitment to the \nRepublic of Palau under the 2010 Compact Review Agreement (CRA).  The CRA requires \npayment of United States commitments in full to enact the Agreement.  Failure to fund the CRA \ncould imperil ongoing national security initiatives with the Republic of Palau and jeopardize \nUnited States access and influence in a region that is increasingly contested by China.   \nMissile Defense Programs.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $308 million to \nUnited States Ballistic Missile Defense programs during a period of escalating threats from \nNorth Korea to the homeland and allies of the United States.     \nCounter-ISIL Train and Equip Fund (CTEF).  The Administration objects to the $112.5 million \nin rescissions to CTEF.  These reductions would limit DOD\u2019s ability to quickly and effectively \nprovide assistance to partners fighting ISIS, undermining the Administration\u2019s \u201cby, with, and \nthrough\u201d strategy to degrade, dismantle, and ultimately defeat ISIS. \nCoalition Support Fund (CSF).  The Administration objects to the $450 million in reductions, \nwhich includes a rescission to CSF.  These reductions would limit DOD\u2019s ability to reimburse \nkey partners in the fight against ISIS and other extremist groups in the region.  The rescission, \nnotably, would reduce funds available for programs that are already underway.  Furthermore, the \nrescission would inhibit the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to conduct foreign policy, limit the \nSecretary of Defense\u2019s ability to act in the national security interest of the United States, and \nunnecessarily complicate relationships with key partners.  \nInnovation and Enhancing Combat Capability.  The Administration objects to the reduction of \n$170 million to the Strategic Capabilities Office FY 2018 Budget request.  Specifically, the \nAdministration is concerned that this reduction would add considerable risk to the timely \n2  demonstration and transition of critical warfighter capabilities. \nDivision C \u2013 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct, 2018 \nDepartment of Defense \nNext National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency West (N2W) Campus.  The Administration objects \nto the Committee\u2019s decision to reduce N2W by $181 million through an incremental funding \napproach and recommends that funding be provided at the FY 2018 Budget request level.  The \nAdministration is opposed to such use of incremental funding for military construction projects \nbecause it undermines program stability and cost discipline and could negatively impact other \nmission-critical priorities.  In the case of this project, the National Geospatial-Intelligence \nAgency expects to obligate the full amount of the Budget request in FY 2018.  \nDivision D \u2013 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n2018 \nCorps of Engineers \nAgency Topline.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s investments in the Nation\u2019s water \nresources through the Corps of Engineers civil works program, but believes that funding should \nbe limited to the amounts requested in the FY 2018 Budget.  The Budget focused on investments \nto maintain the performance of the key features of existing water resources infrastructure that the \nCorps owns and operates and the navigation channels that serve the Nation\u2019s largest coastal \nports.  It also supports the construction of projects that would provide a high economic or \nenvironmental return to the Nation or that would address a significant risk to public safety. \nDepartment of Energy \nMixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility Termination.  The Administration strongly \nobjects to continued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility as \ndirected in the bill.  The project is unaffordable and risky.  The most recent estimates, conducted \nby the Department of Energy and the Corps of Engineers, project $12 billion in remaining \nconstruction costs, and total construction costs of $17 billion when including $5 billion in sunk \ncosts to date.  In addition, the projected operating costs are between $800 million and $1 billion \nper year for nearly two decades.  The alternative\u2014dilute and dispose\u2014is a proven approach with \nsignificantly less risk and expense, and can be implemented decades sooner than the MOX \napproach. \nExcess Facilities.  The Administration strongly opposes the $150 million reduction to the request \nto dispose of excess facilities at the Department of Energy sites that are not in the Environmental \nManagement program.  These resources are critical to addressing the increasing risks these \nfacilities pose.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested $225 million to \nprotect the health and safety of workers and the public, and support modernization of the nuclear \nsecurity enterprise.  \n3  Nuclear Waste Management (Interim Storage and Yucca Mountain Licensing).  While the \nAdministration supports the inclusion of $120 million for nuclear waste management activities, \nthe Administration strongly opposes the prohibition on using funds appropriated from the \nNuclear Waste Fund for interim storage activities. \nApplied Energy Programs.  The Administration commends the Committee for beginning to shift \nthe focus of applied energy research and development to earlier-stage activities where the \nFederal role is strongest, but strongly encourages the Congress to accelerate this shift and further \nreduce funding for costly later-stage development, commercialization, and deployment activities, \nsome of which are unauthorized.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2018 appropriations \nprocess moves forward. \n* * * * * * * \n4  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND \nBUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nFebruary 8, 2018 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nSenate Amendment to H.R. 1892\u2014Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 \n(Sen.

This amendment raises the defense spending caps for fiscal \nyear (FY) 2018 and FY 2019, a key step toward fulfilling the President\u2019s promise to rebuild \nAmerica\u2019s military and ensure funding would be provided to support the enacted National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (NDAA). \nAfter years of dangerous spending reductions and an unpredictable budgetary environment \nperpetuated by numerous continuing resolutions, the Bipartisan Budget Act lays the \ngroundwork for full funding of America\u2019s national defense, within the framework of the \nAdministration\u2019s National Security and Defense Strategies and the NDAA. Passage of this \nlegislation would ensure America is prepared to deter and, if necessary, defeat the full \nspectrum of threats from rival powers, rogue states, and terrorist organizations like the Islamic \nState of Iraq and Syria. \nThe Bipartisan Budget Act lays the groundwork for higher investments in several \nAdministration priorities, including infrastructure and combating the opioid epidemic, and the \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to reflect the Administration\u2019s \ndetailed funding priorities for the remainder of FY 2018 and for FY 2019 for both defense and \nnon-defense needs. \nAt the same time, it is critical that the Congress work to decrease non-defense spending in \nother areas to reduce America\u2019s growing national debt.  The Bipartisan Budget Act provides \nnon- defense discretionary spending levels higher than the Administration deems necessary. \nAdditionally, although the Bipartisan Budget Act does include some spending reductions, \nthe  Administration has proposed hundreds of billions of dollars in additional spending \nreductions that the Congress should also enact without delay in order to improve our fiscal \nstate. \nFurther, the Administration recognizes the Congress\u2019s desire to provide significant funding \nfor victims of the recent hurricanes and wildfires, as provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act \nand previously in the House-passed supplemental bill (H.R. 4667).  The Administration \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that adequate oversight is exercised \nover disaster-related funds to ensure that these funds reach the communities devastated by \nnatural disasters and are not misapplied.  The Administration supports other components of the Bipartisan Budget Act, including \ngreater certainty for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, an extension of funding for \nCommunity Health Centers, and repeal of Obamacare\u2019s Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard (IPAB).  The IPAB authority allows an unelected, unaccountable board to undertake \nmajor changes to the Medicare program.  The repeal of IPAB furthers the President\u2019s goal \nof repealing and replacing  Obamacare.  \nThe Administration also supports suspending the debt limit until March 2019 to provide the \ncertainty to markets around the world that the United States will honor its obligations. \nFurthermore, the Administration is concerned with future extensions of special interest tax \ndeductions and benefits in the wake of tax cuts and reforms that were enacted in \nDecember 2017. \nThe President\u2019s top priority is to keep the Nation safe from those who wish to harm it, both at \nhome and abroad. To do so, the United States military needs the resources provided in the \nBipartisan Budget Act, which have previously been supported on a bipartisan basis in the \nNDAA and in multiple bills passed by the House. \nIf the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 were presented to the President in its current form, his \nadvisors would recommend that he sign it into law. \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20503 \n) \nNovember 13, 2017 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nSubstitute Amendment to H.R. 2874 \u2013 21st Century Flood Reform Act\n(Rep.

This legislation ensures timely reauthorization of the National Flood \nInsurance Program (NFIP) and takes important steps towards common-sense reform.   \nThe Administration endorses provisions of the bill that amend the National Flood Insurance Act \nof 1968 and the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 to expand the private flood insurance \nmarket by removing barriers that prevent policyholders from switching between private and \nFederal flood insurance, and by allowing private flood insurance companies to sell both Federal \nand private flood insurance.  Additionally, the bill would strengthen the financial outlook of the \nNFIP by authorizing the program to build up its reserves to pay for future catastrophic flooding \nevents.  H.R. 2874 would require the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make \ncertain flood risk and claims data publicly available, while protecting personally identifiable \ninformation.  Finally, the bill would require property owners to disclose a property\u2019s history of \nflooding as part of a real estate transaction.  \nThe Administration appreciates the intent behind H.R. 2874, which is to encourage better risk \nmanagement by the NFIP through the incremental phase-out of certain subsidized policies.  The \nAdministration continues to support more immediate accounting for past repeated flood claims as \nwell as additional measures to expand the private flood insurance market, such as by phasing out \nthe availability of Federal flood insurance for newly constructed buildings and commercial \nbuildings, and by encouraging private risk pooling through reforms to existing law.

This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize \nregional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for \nactivities on public lands.  The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located \nmostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy \nand mineral development.

In  the  \n2020  election, more  than 150  million  Americans  of  every  age,  of every  race, of every  \nbackground  exercised their right to vote.  \nThis  historic level  of participation in  the  face  of  a once-in-a-century  pandemic  should have  \nbeen celebrated by everyone.   Instead, some have  sought to delegitimize the election and \nmake it  harder to vote, in many  cases by targeting  the methods of voting that made it  \npossible for many  voters  to participate.  These  efforts violate  the most basic ideals of \nAmerica.  \nMeanwhile, yet another wave of discriminatory action is upon us,  as we enter a new  \nlegislative redistricting  cycle.

This bipartisan legislation will  lead to the  \ndevelopment of Federal standards to ensure that health care  and social service  employers develop \nand implement plans to protect their staff, prevent and improve the response to workplace  \nviolence, and address existing barriers to reporting. \nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, incidents of violence against health care  and social \nservice workers  have been  on the rise.  A 2016 Government Accountability  Office  study reported \nthat rates of violence against health care  workers are up to 12 times higher than rates for the  \noverall workforce.  In 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that health care  and social \nservice workers were nearly five times as likely to suffer a serious workplace violence injury  \nthan workers in other sectors, and that healthcare  workers accounted for 73 percent of such \ninjuries.   In 2017, state  government health care  and social service  workers were  almost nine  \ntimes more likely to be injured by  an assault than private-sector health care workers.  \nFront line employees in these settings interact with a range of patients, clients, and their families, \noften with little training  or direction for how to handle interactions that may  become violent.  \nWorkplace violence  often causes both physical and emotional harm.  Victims of these incidents \noften suffer post-traumatic  stress that undermines  their ability to continue their employment in \nthat sector.  This burdens  a  stretched health care workforce  that has been severely impacted by  \nthe COVID-19 pandemic.   There is currently no Occupational Safety  and Health Administration \n(OSHA)  standard that requires employers to implement violence prevention plans that  would \nhelp reduce workplace violence injuries among health care  and social service workers.  \nUnder the  Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act,  \nOSHA  must  issue an interim final standard in one  year and a final standard within 42 months \nrequiring employers in the health care  and social service sectors to develop and implement a  \nworkplace violence prevention plan.   Under such a  standard, employers would need to ensure  \nthat health care and social service workers are directly involved in the development, \nimplementation,  and assessment of these plans.   This will include identifying risks, specifying  \nsolutions, and requiring  training, reporting, and incident investigations.  It would also provide \nprotections from retaliation for reporting violent incidents.   Additionally, this legislation will   protect health care  and social service workers in the public sector in 24 states where  those  \nemployees are  not covered by OSHA protections.  \nThe Administration commends the bipartisan support for the  Workplace Violence Prevention for \nHealth Care  and Social Service Workers Act  and urges swift passage of this legislation.

This action would ensure that this rule, which eliminated pollution  standards for methane  \nemissions from the oil and gas sector and eliminated all emission standards for the transmission \nand storage segments of that sector, will have no force or effect and reinstate the pollution \nreduction requirements established under the Clean Air Act in 2012 and 2016.  \nAddressing methane leaks through detection and repair by using  already cost-effective  \ntechnologies  can spur the creation of  good-paying  jobs fixing leaking equipment and pipelines \u2013  \nall while minimizing waste and reducing this powerful source of pollution.  Today, the oil and \ngas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions  \u2013  a potent climate-disrupting  \ngreenhouse  gas  that is  responsible for approximately one-third of the  global warming and the \nresulting climate disruption we are already experiencing from climate change.  In order to \neffectively mitigate climate change, addressing methane pollution from this and other sectors is  \nan urgent and essential step.  \nEvery American has a fundamental right to  breathe clean air and drink clean water.  These  \nmethane emissions \u2013  leaking during oil and gas production, transmission, and distribution \nactivities \u2013  also contribute to the formation of smog, or ground-level ozone, which is harmful to \nboth human health and agriculture.  Oil and gas production is also a significant emitter of \ncarcinogenic and smog-forming volatile organic compounds into frontline communities.  These  \ncommunities, as well as children, the elderly, outdoor workers, and individuals with respiratory  \nconditions, are at higher risk of experiencing harmful health outcomes due to exposure to such \npollution.  Oil and gas pollution can also be carried by the wind and intensify  air pollution \nproblems in communities along that path, including across state boundaries.  \nThe Clean Air Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA)  to protect Americans \nfrom dangerous air pollution, including methane  and volatile organic compounds.  Nonetheless, \nthe rule that this  resolution disapproves  of  took four harmful actions that increased  the amount of  harmful pollution to which Americans are exposed:  (1) the elimination of pollution standards for \nmethane emissions from the oil and gas sector; (2) the elimination of all air pollution standards \nfor the transmission and storage segments of the oil and gas sector; (3)  removal of the predicate \nthat establishes EPA\u2019s obligation to address the  extensive methane pollution emitted by existing  \nsources; and (4) establishment of a new, non-statutory  requirement that EPA make an additional, \npollutant-specific finding of significant contribution to endangerment before addressing harmful \nair pollution from a sector already regulated under the Clean Air Act.  All four of these actions \nwould be reversed by the passage and signature of the resolution.  \nS.J. Res. 14 will restore robust Clean Air Act pollution standards for this sector, protecting  \nAmerican communities.  The resolution will also clear the pathway for  EPA to evaluate  \nopportunities to promulgate even stronger standards under section 111 of the Clean Air Act to \naddress dangerous methane and other pollution from both new and existing sources across the oil \nand gas sector.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to restore  these \ncritically important pollution standards.  \n \n* * * * * * *   \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND  BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nMarch  15, 2022  \n(House  Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT  OF   DMINISTRATION   OLICY \nH.R. 2116 \u2013  Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair \n(CROWN)  Act of 2022  \n(Rep.

Over the course of our Nation\u2019s history, society has used hair texture and hairstyle  \n\u2014  along  with  race, national origin and skin color\u2014  to discriminate  against individuals.   \nPernicious forms of systemic racism  persist when dress and grooming  codes, for  example, \nprohibit hair texture or hairstyle that is commonly associated with a particular race or national \norigin.  Such discrimination has imposed significant economic costs, learning disruption, and \ndenial of economic opportunities  for people of  color.   Black women, for example, experience  \ndiscrimination in hiring because of natural hair styles, and  Black girls experience  \ndisproportionate rates of school discipline, sometimes  for discriminatory hair violations.  \nSince the President took office,  the Administration has  worked to  advance  equity  and address \nentrenched disparities that hold people back.

The  President also signed Executive Order 14020 Establishing  the White House  \nGender Policy Council,  and mandating the release  of the first-ever U.S. government strategy to \naddress gender equity and equality.  This strategy  lays out  a vision for  addressing the impact of \nintersectional discrimination and bias on the basis of gender, race, and other factors, including  \nthose faced by women and girls of color.  In signing these orders, the President recognized  that \npreventing  discrimination in employment,  education, housing, and other programs that receive \nFederal financial assistance  would bolster  the strength of our  economy and advance equal \nopportunity for  all Americans.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact this legislation and \nensure  that it is effectively  implemented.    \n \n* * * * * * *  \n  2   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nMay  11, 2021  \n(House Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT  OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 2547 \u2013  Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act  \n(Rep.

Pregnant workers  are too often unable to access simple changes to their working  \nconditions that would allow them to keep doing their jobs and do so safely.   This can create risks \nto their health as well as economic consequences.  No worker should be forced to choose  \nbetween a paycheck and a healthy pregnancy.   \nThe Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would provide basic, long overdue protections to ensure that \npregnant workers and job applicants are not fired or otherwise discriminated against, or denied \nreasonable  accommodations  that allow them to work.  Such protections  promote  family  \neconomic security  by helping women stay in the workforce, including for  those, often women of  \ncolor, who are  the sole or primary breadwinners  in their families.  Approximately two million \nwomen have left the workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic, eroding more than 30 years of  \nprogress in women\u2019s labor force participation, and this Administration is committed  to ensuring  \nthat women can both care for and support themselves and their families.  \nH.R. 1065 is a bipartisan bill that requires certain employers to make reasonable \naccommodations for qualified employees and job applicants with known limitations related to  \npregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.  These accommodations might include \nsimple modifications, such as modifying a no-food-or-drink policy, providing additional break \ntime to use the bathroom, or helping avoid the lifting of heavy objects, depending on the \ncircumstances.  The bill would require employers to provide reasonable accommodations for \nqualified pregnant workers unless doing so would pose an undue hardship to the employer.  It \nwould also provide for an interactive process, where necessary, between employers and pregnant \nworkers to determine appropriate and effective reasonable accommodations, and would protect \npregnant workers from being denied employment opportunities, or from retaliation or \ninterference, because they request or use an accommodation.  \nThe Administration encourages the House to pass this bipartisan, commonsense legislation and \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to protect pregnant workers across the country.

We have  seen the consequences of this broad \ndisinvestment in our lack of preparedness to effectively respond to a  global  pandemic.  We see it  \nin global competitors that are catching up or even surpassing the  United States in research and \ndevelopment.  In addition, we see it in longstanding inequities that have been deepened by  \nchronic underinvestment in programs that are drivers of opportunity, such as Head Start and K-12 \neducation.

The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s funding  in the bill for the  \nexpansion of Registered Apprenticeship and efforts to increase access to the model for historically  \nunderrepresented groups.   \nUnemployment Insurance  (UI) Administration.  The Administration appreciates the funding  \nprovided in the bill to expand State grants for  UI  administration, accommodating workload \nincreases and allowing the Department to fully modernize the funding formula for the first time in  \ndecades.   Further, the Administration appreciates the critical support for UI  National Activities,  \nwhich would help modernize information technology and support States in administering the UI  \nprogram.   \nDepartment of  Health and Human Services  (HHS)  \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).   The Administration appreciates that \nthe bill provides initial funding to establish ARPA-H so it can begin its important and \ntransformative work  to improve human health.  However, the  Administration is disappointed that \nthe bill provides  significantly  less than the  level  requested in the FY 2022 Budget and that the  \nfunding is contingent on future congressional  action.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking  with the Congress to ensure that ARPA-H is funded at  levels commensurate with its bold \nmission.   It is critical that ARPA-H is established and operational in FY 2022 so the agency  can \nrapidly undertake  its life-saving work in such critical areas as  cancer, infectious diseases, and  \nAlzheimer\u2019s  for the benefit  of all Americans.  \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Topline.   The  Administration appreciates that \nthe bill fully  funds the FY 2022 Budget request for CDC.  This funding would help restore  \ncapacity  at the world\u2019s preeminent public health agency, address health disparities, support  \ncommunity violence prevention, and promote health equity among other critical public health \nneeds.  Building on the investments in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, this funding would \nhelp CDC support core public health capacity improvements in States and Territories, modernize  \npublic health data collection nationwide, train new epidemiologists and other public health \nexperts, and build international capacity to detect, prepare for, and respond to emerging  global  \nthreats and the current COVID-19 pandemic.  \n2 Ending the Opioid Epidemic.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides robust  \nfunding to address the opioid overdose  epidemic, which has worsened in the COVID-19 \npandemic.  CDC preliminary data  estimates there  were over 93,000 deaths  related to drug  \noverdoses in 2020, of which nearly 70,000 were  related to opioid use, and the funding requested \nin the FY 2022 Budget request would increase access to prevention, treatment, and creates  a new  \n10 percent set aside in the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment  Block Grant for recovery  \nsupport services.  \nEnding the HIV Epidemic.  The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the  FY 2022 \nBudget request for Ending the HIV Epidemic.  This funding would help aggressively  reduce new  \nHIV cases while increasing access to  treatment, expanding the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis, \nalso known as PrEP, and promoting equitable  access to services and support.   \nCommunity Mental Health Services Block Grant.   The Administration appreciates that the bill \nfully funds the  FY 2022 Budget request for the Community Mental Health Services  Block Grant.   \nThis historic investment would help address the strains on the Nation\u2019s mental healthcare system, \nwhich have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nStrategic National Stockpile (SNS).  The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the  \nFY 2022 Budget request  for the SNS.  The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an extraordinary  \nstrain on the SNS and this funding would allow  for the replenishment of  critical materiel and \npreparation for the next public health emergency.   \nSyringe Services Program.   The Administration appreciates that the bill does not place any  \nrestrictions on the use of  Federal funds for syringe services programs  and sterile syringes.  These \nproven and effective community-based prevention programs provide  a range of services, \nincluding linkage to infectious disease care  and substance use treatment.   \nChild Welfare Funding and Equity Grants.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s strong  \nfunding for child welfare and child abuse prevention programs, especially the inclusion of  \n$100 million to create a new competitive grant program to advance equity  and reduce racial  \ndisproportionalities in the child welfare system.  This funding would help State and local child \nwelfare agencies partner  with education, health, and early childhood agencies and with \ncommunity stakeholders to engage in a  continuous improvement cycle to advance  equity while  \nsafely reducing the number of children who enter foster care by re-orienting child welfare systems  \nto a prevention-first model.  \nEarly Childhood Education.  The Administration appreciates the funding included for the Child \nCare and Development  Block Grant, Head Start, and Preschool Development Grants, which total  \nover $20 billion and represent a $3.1 billion increase over the FY 2021 enacted level.  These  \ninvestments would expand access to high-quality,  affordable child care and  early learning  \nprograms for children from low-income households that would foster healthy  development and \nimprove outcomes later in life.  \nFamily Violence.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s full support of the  \nAdministration\u2019s FY 2022 Budget request for increased funding  for the  Family  Violence  \n3 Prevention and Services program and National Domestic Violence Hotline, as well as cash \nassistance for survivors of domestic violence.   \n \nRefugee Resettlement.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of funding to \nrebuild refugee resettlement infrastructure after  years of neglect and to provide social services,  \ntime-limited cash, and medical assistance to resettle up to 125,000 refugees in FY 2022.  \n \nDepartment of Education (Education)  \n \nOverall Education Funding.  The Administration appreciates the strong funding support in the bill  \nfor public schools, colleges, and universities with the inclusion of the full FY 2022 Budget  \nrequest of $102.8 billion.  This historic investment would help the Nation build back better and \nlay the  foundation for shared growth and prosperity for decades to come.  \n \nTitle I.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s historic increase of $19.5 billion for the  \nTitle  I program, which would provide critical support to students and teachers in high poverty  \nschools.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on ways to advance  \nshared priorities, including improving educator compensation and improving the  equity  and \nadequacy of State and local school finance systems. \n \nSpecial Education.  The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of over $17 billion  \nfor  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) programs.  The additional funding would \nsupport special education and related services for  over 7.6 million students  with disabilities and is  \na significant step toward fully funding  IDEA.  The  bill also makes critical reforms to the  IDEA  \nInfants and Families program to expand access to early intervention services for underserved \nchildren, including  children of color  and children from low-income families.     \n \nSchool Counselors, Nurses and Psychologists.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  \ninclusion of $1 billion toward increasing the number of school  counselors, nurses, and \npsychologists.  The bill splits the funding into two existing education programs, with $500 million  \nto School-based Mental  Health Services  Grants and $500 million to Mental Health Professional  \nDemonstration Grants.  This investment would help support the mental health and well-being of  \nthe Nation\u2019s students, teachers, and school staff  as they navigate their new  normal given  all the  \nCOVID-19 pandemic disruptions.  \n \nFull Service Community  Schools.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of  \n$443 million toward the  Full-Service Community  Schools program.  Community schools have  \nand will continue to play  a critical role in providing comprehensive  wrap-around services during  \nand after the COVID-19 pandemic.  This additional support would allow for the creation of an \nestimated 800 new community schools serving up to 2.4 million additional students, families, and \ncommunity members.   \n \nFostering Diverse Schools.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of  \n$100 million for this new competitive grant program, which would help communities develop and \nimplement strategies to build more diverse student bodies.  \n \n4 Pell Grants.  The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s $400 increase to the maximum Pell \nGrant, for  a new maximum award of $6,895, and the expansion of eligibility  for Pell Grants to \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and those with temporary  protected status.  The  \nAdministration also appreciates the increase of $2.3 billion in funding to support the  \napproximately seven  million Pell recipients.    \n \nStudent Aid Administration.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s $200 million increase to  \nStudent Aid Administration, the account that supports the administration of the Federal student  \nfinancial assistance programs.  These programs, that help students and families pay  for the cost of  \npost-secondary education, are the Nation\u2019s largest source of  financial  aid for post-secondary  \nstudents.  This increase is also critical to ensuring safe and  effective loan servicing for over  \n40 million Federal student loan borrowers and to implement the necessary  requirements in the  \nFAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act.   \n \nSocial Security Administration (SSA)  \n \nLimitation on Administrative Expenses.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s funding  \nfor SSA\u2019s frontline operations to improve customer service  and address  the disability claims  \nbacklog.  \n \nCorporation for National and Community Service  \n \nAmeriCorps.  The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s strong support for national service  \nthrough the  funding increases for AmeriCorps.  This additional funding would allow the agency  \nto increase its support for volunteers across the Nation, improving the lives of people served \nwhile building an ethic of national service.  \n \nNational Labor  Relations Board  \n \nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  \nfunding for the NLRB, which would allow the agency to rebuild its staffing and support  \nmeaningful improvements in the protection of collective bargaining  rights nationally.  \n \nConstitutional  Concerns  \n \nOne provision of the draft bill raises separation of  powers concerns, including by conditioning the  \nExecutive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval of the House and Senate  \nCommittees on Appropriations.  The Administration looks forward to working with  the Congress  \nto address these  and other concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5 Division B\u2014Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related  \nAgencies Appropriations Act, 2022 \n \nDepartment of  Agriculture (USDA)  \n \nClimate and Clean Energy.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s recognition that \nnew funding is needed to respond to the climate crisis.  The bill provides $347 million in new  \ninvestments across USDA, including many of the requested increases for  climate change and  \nclean energy.   The Administration would like to work with the Congress to ensure, as the bill  \nmoves through the process, that there is adequate  funding for Rural Cooperative Assistance, to \nhelp rural communities accelerate to a carbon pollution free electricity sector by 2035, for  \ntransitioning the USDA fleet to electric vehicles, and new climate funding requested for the  \nAgriculture Research Service to support the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate  that \nwould support USDA technology needs including  heat- and drought-resistant food and agriculture  \nsupply chain. \n \nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children.  The Administration  \nappreciates that the Committee provided $6 billion in new budget authority  to address the  \nnutritional needs of pregnant and postpartum women, infants, toddlers, and young children and to \nsupport science-backed nutrition recommendations for 6.4 million participants.   \n \nStrikeForce Initiative.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s funding for the new  \nStrikeForce initiative at the requested level, which would allow USDA to leverage its extensive  \nnetwork of county-based offices for community outreach.   \n \nRural Broadband.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for rural broadband.  \nThe bill provides $137 million above the FY 2022 Budget request for the ReConnect Program and \nrefinancing budget authority for telecommunication loans, equal to the FY  2022 Budget request  \nthat would help rural providers deploy future-proof technology, while lowering the  cost for  \nconsumers.   \n \nRural Housing Programs.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee funded the  \nrequested  increases for the rural single-family homeownership direct loans, funded at $1.5 billion \nand loan guarantees funded at $30 billion, as well as rental assistance and housing vouchers at  \n$1.5 billion.  The funding would provide approximately 182,000 loans  and loan guarantees, and \nallow USDA to continue  the necessary level of assistance to low income homebuyers, giving  \nthem opportunities to improve their living  conditions and financial footing  through investment in \ntheir own neighborhoods.  \n \nRural  Water and Wastewater Grants and Loans.  The Administration appreciates the  \nCommittee\u2019s support for rural water and wastewater  grants and loans, particularly the increases  \nfor  grants targeted to Colonias, Native Americans, and Alaskan Native Villages as well as  other  \nrural communities, many of whom disproportionately lack access to quality water and sewer  \ninfrastructure.   \n \n6 Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s full \nfunding for FSIS inspectors, which would allow the agency to continue to meet the demands of its  \ncritical food safety mission.    \n \nDepartment of  Health and Human Services  \n \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided by  \nthe Committee to support a number of  agency initiatives, including targeted increases to several  \npriorities in the FY 2022 Budget request, such as  emerging  chemical  and toxicology issues, drug  \nsafety surveillance and oversight,  and medical device supply  chain resilience.   The \nAdministration  would like to work with the Congress to ensure, as the bill moves through the  \nprocess, that there is adequate funding for:   maternal and infant health and nutrition;  efforts  to \naddress the opioid crisis;  and critical public health infrastructure needs, including capacity  \nbuilding and enterprise-wide data-modernization in order  to revitalize FDA\u2019s outdated data  \ninfrastructure and support fundamental FDA operations to keep pace with new requirements and \nregulatory responsibilities as requested in the  FY  2022 Budget.     \n \nConstitutional  Concerns  \n \nCertain provisions of the  bill raise separation of powers concerns, including  by conditioning the  \nExecutive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval of the House and Senate  \nCommittees on Appropriations.  Other provisions would unduly interfere  with the President\u2019s  \nability to supervise the  Executive Branch.  The Administration looks forward to working with the  \nCongress to address these and other  concerns.  \n \n \nDivision C\u2014Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,  \n2022 \n \nArmy Corps of Engineers (Corps)  \n \nCorps Topline.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the Army Corps  \nCivil Works  program.   The Administration also appreciates the commitment to climate resilient \nwater infrastructure.    \n \nDepartment of Energy (DOE)  \n \nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Topline.  The  Administration \nappreciates the Committee\u2019s robust support for EERE, a top Administration priority, at over  \n$900 million above FY 2021 enacted level.  EERE would play  a key role in achieving the  \nPresident\u2019s goals of a  carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and a net zero economy by  \n2050, all while creating  good-paying jobs and building a more equitable  economy.  Not only does  \nEERE drive innovation across renewables, buildings, vehicles, manufacturing, and fuels, it also \nhelps weatherize homes in underserved communities and ensure that the Federal Government is  \nan environmental steward across its physical footprint.  The Administration appreciates that the  \nCommittee  is funding several new programs within EERE, including the Build Back Better  \n7 Challenge Grants, Weatherization Readiness Fund, and  Local Government  Clean Energy  \nWorkforce Program, but strongly urges the Congress to provide the full levels  requested in the  FY  \n2022 Budget for these programs.  The Administration looks forward to working with the  \nCongress in maximizing the impact of these investments, as well as exploring what more could be  \ndone to meet critical climate  goals.    \n \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and Advanced Research Projects Agency-\nClimate (ARPA-C).   The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for    ARPA-E at  \n$173 million above the FY 2021 enacted level, a key program that has proven effective at  \nidentifying and supporting revolutionary energy technologies that  enhance the Nation\u2019s economic  \nand energy security.  The  Administration  continues to believe that the establishment of an ARPA\u2013 \nC would enable more effective cross Government  collaboration that would lead to the \ndevelopment of innovative climate solutions.  The Administration looks forward to working  with \nthe Congress on this urgent issue.  \n \nNational Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The Administration appreciates the  \nCommittee\u2019s strong support for national security by  providing a  robust level of funding  for  \nDOE\u2019s NNSA, commensurate with the President\u2019s FY 2022 Budget request.  The Administration \nis concerned, however, that certain provisions of the bill appear to pre-judge the outcome of the  \nNuclear Posture Review  (NPR) now underway.  As the Administration works to reduce the role  \nof nuclear weapons in the national security strategy, it looks forward to working with the  \nCongress to ensure that the most critical elements  of the nuclear modernization program are  fully  \nfunded and that the  FY 2022 funding levels do not constrain policy options available for  \nconsideration by the President in the NPR.    \n \nOffice of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED).  The Administration appreciates the  \nCommittee\u2019s support for establishing the OCED.  The OCED would serve as the Department\u2019s  \nhub for accelerating the  maturation of near- and mid-term clean energy technologies  and systems  \nwith the goal of quicker  commercial adoption and increased availability.  The OCED would \naccomplish this through  a systematic approach  that is informed by,  and integrated with, existing  \nclean energy innovation initiatives across DOE\u2019s diverse program and functional offices, sites and \nassociated National  Laboratories.   The OCED would also be instrumental in executing the  \ndemonstration portfolio envisioned by the Energy  Act of 2020.   \n \nEquity and Justice.  The  Administration appreciates that the Committee recognizes the  \nimportance of increasing  engagement with communities impacted by  climate change, air and  \nwater pollution, systemic racism and underinvestment, high energy costs, and economic  \ninequality.  The  Administration urges the Congress to support requested resources for the  \nEnvironmental Management program toward this goal for Historically  Black Colleges and \nUniversities and other Minority Serving  Institutions.    \n \nIndian Energy.  The  Administration appreciates that the bill provides $70 million for the Office of  \nIndian Energy, a tripling  of the program over the prior  year, needed to make substantial progress  \nin achieving universal  energy access for  Indian country and for transitioning the Nation\u2019s tribal  \ncolleges and universities to renewable energy.  While more opportunities may  exist to advance  \n8 access to all communities equitably, this investment represents  a significant step forward in \nachieving such equity in Indian country and tribal communities.   \n \nThe Office of Nuclear Energy (NE).   The Administration appreciates the $1.8 billion provided in \nthe bill for NE.  The investments in the bill would allow for nuclear energy  to play a  critical role \nin combating climate  change through the demonstration of advanced reactors, creating  good-\npaying jobs in advanced manufacturing, and securing the Nation\u2019s place  as  the global leader in \nnuclear science and technology.   The Administration  also  urges the Congress to continue funding  \nfor the Versatile Test Reactor Project,  an essential tool for America to  regain its global nuclear  \nenergy leadership role in the development of advanced reactors.   \n \nLoan Programs.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for administrative  \nexpenses necessary to run the loan programs and deploy  available loan authority to advance its  \nclimate goals.  The Administration urges the  Congress to reconsider appropriating additional  \ncredit subsidy  and loan authority for the  Title 17 program to support innovative electric vehicle  \ninfrastructure, carbon management, and other clean energy projects that create  good paying jobs  \nwith a free and fair choice to join a union.   \n \nDepartment of  Interior  \n \nBureau of Reclamation.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides a net of  \n$1.9 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project, $413 million, or \n28 percent, above the  FY 2022 Budget request.  The Administration also appreciates the funding  \nfor Reclamation, which would benefit the western water infrastructure and improve the Nation\u2019s  \nclimate resiliency, particularly in this time of severe drought.    \n \nIndian Water Rights Settlements.   The Administration appreciates that the bill fully  funds the  \nrequest for  Indian Water  Rights Settlements.  The Administration  looks forward to working with \nthe Congress on a proposal to reclassify  as mandatory  funding the amounts necessary to meet  \nFederal commitments for existing enacted  Indian  Water Rights Settlements starting in FY 2023.   \nThis would provide a stable and comprehensive funding source to meet these legal requirements  \nto Tribes.  \n \nConstitutional  Concerns  \n \nSections 101 and 201 of the bill would raise separation of powers concerns  by conditioning the  \nExecutive\u2019s authority to reprogram funds on receiving the approval of the  House and Senate  \nCommittees on Appropriations.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress  \nto address this and other  concerns.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9 Division D\u2014Financial  Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2022 \n \nDepartment of the Treasury  \n \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS).  The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the  \nIRS.  The investments in the bill would enable increased oversight of high-income and corporate \ntax returns, new and improved online tools for better communication between taxpayers and the  \nIRS, and improved taxpayer customer service\u2014including outreach and assistance to underserved \ncommunities.   \n \nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network  (FinCEN).  The Administration appreciates the  \nCommittee\u2019s support for FinCEN.  The additional  resources provided in the bill to create a  \ndatabase that tracks the ownership and control of certain companies  and organizations would help \ncombat the use of  complex corporate structures to shield illegal activity.   \n \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The Administration appreciates  \nthe Committee\u2019s support for increased investments in CDFI programs that flow to communities  \nand geographic areas where access to capital is most needed, including rural areas and persistent  \npoverty counties.  \n \nExecutive Office of the President  \n \nOffice of Management and Budget  (OMB).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  \nsupport for additional funding to invest in the career OMB workforce that  is charged with helping  \nthe President meet policy, budget, management, and regulatory objectives in an effective  and \nefficient manner.  The  Administration also shares the Committee\u2019s goal of increasing spending  \ntransparency.  However, the Administration objects to sections 204, 747, and 749 of the bill  \nwhich would impose new requirements, limitations, and conditions related to the thousands of  \napportionment actions  processed by OMB each  year.  These requirements would undermine  \nOMB\u2019s ability to ensure the effective implementation of the law, and efficient use of taxpayer  \nresources.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure appropriate  \nlevels of transparency  while also preserving  the Executive Branch\u2019s role in funds management.   \nThe Administration  also objects to the inclusion of previously enacted provisions that are  \nunnecessarily  restrictive, such as one purporting to bar OMB from expending funds to alter the  \nannual work plan of the  Army Corps of Engineers.   \n \nGeneral Services  Administration (GSA)  \n \nFederal Buildings Fund (FBF).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the  \nFederal  Buildings Fund, including the Climate and Resilience Special Emphasis Program, and \napplauds the Committee\u2019s efforts to reinstate the capital program.  However, the Administration  \nurges the Congress to provide full funding for the  FBF at the  anticipated level of rent collections, \nas proposed in the  FY 2022 Budget request, which would support priority repair and alteration \nprojects as well as new construction projects.  \n \n10 Electric Vehicles  Fund.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for the  \nrequested $300 million at GSA to support the Administration\u2019s goal of electrifying the Federal  \nfleet.  The Electric Vehicles Fund provides the mechanism for GSA to procure zero emission and \nelectric vehicles and the associated charging infrastructure on behalf of  Federal agencies.   \n \nTechnology Modernization Fund (TMF).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided in \nthe bill for the TMF and urges the Congress to provide the full $500 million  requested in the  FY  \n2022 Budget, which would support a more rapid transition of legacy systems and the adoption of  \nmore secure commercial  technology.  With $1 billion in seed funding  appropriated through the  \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the TMF  Board has received more than 100 proposals from  \nagencies totaling over $2.1 billion in requested funds, far exceeding the  amount of resources  \navailable.   \n \nSmall Business Administration (SBA)  \n \nEntrepreneurial Development Programs.  The Administration  appreciates the Committee\u2019s  \nsupport for the proposed investments in counseling and training targeted to underserved small  \nbusinesses and innovation programs.  The  funds provided in the bill would enable SBA to expand \naccess to free technical assistance services to help small businesses start, grow, and recover.  \n \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM)  \n \nSalaries and Expenses.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for an additional  \n$42 million at OPM to strengthen its workforce, improve information technology (IT), address  \nadministrative funding  gaps resulting  from the transfer of the background investigations program  \nto the Department of  Defense, and reassert OPM\u2019s policymaking leadership responsibilities.  \n \nIT  Working Capital Fund.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the  \nnecessary transfer authority requested to operationalize an IT Working Capital Fund at OPM and \nurges the Congress to also support transfer  authority at other  agencies to enable broader adoption \nof the funding flexibilities authorized by the Modernizing Government Technology provisions  \nenacted in the  National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.  \n \nOther  Independent Agencies  \n \nElection Assistance Commission (EAC) Election Security Grants.  The Administration appreciates  \nthe Committee\u2019s support for the EAC and is committed to working with the Congress to \nmodernize America\u2019s elections system and make those systems more secure.  \n \nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) Funding.  The  Administration appreciates  the Committee\u2019s  \nsupport for the FTC at the FY 2022 Budget request level of $390 million, which would support  \nantitrust investigations and consumer protections.   \n \nOther Provisions  \n \nSupervision of the Executive Branch.  The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  \n11 recognition of the crucial role played by the  Federal workforce and their employee  rights, but is  \nconcerned that the telework specific portion in section 750 of the bill may  impede the President\u2019s  \nability to manage Executive Branch functions.    \n \nConstitutional  Concerns  \n \nCertain provisions of the  draft bill raise separation of powers  concerns, including by conditioning  \nthe Executive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval  of the House and \nSenate Committees on  Appropriations.  Other provisions would unduly interfere with the  \nPresident\u2019s ability to supervise the Executive  Branch.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking  with the Congress to address these and other concerns.  \n \n \nDivision E\u2014Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  \nAppropriations Act, 2022 \n \nDepartment of the  Interior (DOI)  \n \nTribal Programs.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support of DOI\u2019s tribal programs, \nincluding funding to support tribal students and teachers, tribal law enforcement, tribal clean \nenergy development, and tribal land consolidation.   \n \nLand Management Operations.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for DOI\u2019s land \nmanagement operations,  which are critical to strengthening climate resilience and  conservation  \npartnerships and investing in healthy lands  and waters that would create jobs and improve the  \neconomies of energy communities across the Nation.    \n \nSage Grouse.  The  Administration is pleased that the bill supports sage  grouse conservation \nefforts at the  Bureau of  Land Management and removes the statutory  restriction on listing the  \nsage  grouse under the Endangered Species Act.    \n \nIndian Water Rights Settlements.  The  Administration appreciates that the bill funds  Indian Land \nand Water Claim Settlements at the level requested in the FY 2022  Budget.  The Administration  \nlooks forward to working with the Congress on a proposal to reclassify  as mandatory funding for  \npayments for enacted Indian Water Rights Settlements beginning in FY 2023, which would create  \na stable, comprehensive funding source to meet these legal requirements to Tribes.   \n \nDOI  and Department of  Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service  \n \nWildland Fire Management.  The Administration appreciates that the bill supports wildland fire  \nmanagement efforts at both departments, notably for hazardous fuels management and wildfire  \nsuppression\u2014via the wildfire cap adjustment.  Within DOI, the Administration is also pleased  \nthat the bill provides necessary resources for burned area rehabilitation projects and for the  \nincrease in funding  for the Joint Fire Science program.  Within USDA, the bill supports the  \nAdministration\u2019s request  for the Salaries  and Expenses account to fund staffing level increases  \n12 needed to achieve performance targets for hazardous fuel projects, and  for  preparedness increases  \nto fund unmanned aerial  systems, risk management assistance, and technology modernization.   \n \nGreat American Outdoors Act.  The Administration appreciates that the bill supports projects  \nidentified by DOI and USDA for funding under the Great American Outdoors Act, and looks  \nforward to working with the Congress to execute projects in a timely  and results-oriented manner.   \n \nDepartment of  Health and Human Services  \n \nIndian Health Service  (IHS).  The Administration appreciates the funding increase provided by  \nthe Committee to carry out the  IHS\u2019  critical work  in providing high-quality and comprehensive  \nhealth services.  However, the Administration is concerned that the bill does not contain the  \nrequested advance appropriation for FY 2023, which is a tribal priority.  The Administration \nurges the Congress to enact the FY 2022 Budget request\u2019s proposal for advance  appropriations in \nFY 2023, which would provide funding and certainty to Tribal Health Programs, Urban Indian \nOrganizations, and IHS federally-operated health programs in the event of  continuing resolutions  \nor other funding delays that affect continuity of patient care services and otherwise create barriers  \nto providing high-quality healthcare services for American  Indians and Alaska Natives.     \n \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA)  \n \nEPA Topline.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides $11.3 billion for EPA\u2019s  \ntopline, $111 million above the FY 2022 Budget request.  This robust funding would support the  \nagency\u2019s mission to protect human health and the environment.    \n \nEPA Operating Budget.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides $4.3 billion for  \nEPA\u2019s operating budget.  This funding level would support EPA staffing  efforts, restoring and \nexpanding the agency\u2019s  ability to carry out its duties and functions.  It is important to ensure  \nsufficient funds are available for EPA to provide  appropriate management of grants and of the  \nAgency as  a whole.   \n \nEnvironmental Justice.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides $892 million above  \nthe FY 2021 enacted level toward a new Accelerating Environmental  and Economic Justice  \ninitiative at EPA.  This funding level would support initiatives that create  good-paying union jobs, \nclean up pollution, and secure  environmental justice for  communities that have been left behind.   \n \nWater Infrastructure.  The Administration appreciates the $3.6 billion included in the bill for  \nEPA\u2019s water infrastructure programs.  This grant  and loan funding would support critical drinking  \nwater and  wastewater infrastructure investments.    \n \nBiomass Energy.  The Administration appreciates that the bill removes the requirement for EPA,  \nDOE, and USDA to treat forest biomass as carbon neutral.  This would allow the agencies to \ndetermine and account  for the net biogenic  carbon dioxide  emissions effects of using forest \nbiomass fuels for energy.    \n \n \n13 Constitutional  Concerns  \n \nCertain provisions of the  draft bill raise constitutional issues, including by conditioning the  \nExecutive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval of the House and Senate  \nCommittees on Appropriations and by mandating  certain legislative recommendations.   The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other  concerns.  \n \n \nDivision F\u2014Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations  \nAct, 2022  \n \nDepartment of  Defense (DOD)  \n \nDetainee Matters.   The  Administration appreciates that the bill does not include language  \nprohibiting the use of  funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to \nhouse individuals held in the detention facility at  Guantanamo Bay.  Such provisions  have \nhistorically constrained the flexibility that the Nation\u2019s Armed Forces  and  counterterrorism \nprofessionals need to best protect U.S. national security  and intruded on the Executive Branch\u2019s  \nability to carry out its missions.   \n \nReprioritization of Military Construction Funding to Unrequested Projects.  The bill proposes to \nincrementally fund 12 military construction projects, creating an unfunded obligation of  \n$968 million needed to complete these projects in future  years.  The Administration  looks  forward  \nto working with the Congress to ensure incremental funding does not endanger completion of  \nthese projects or  raise the projected  cost.  \n \nDepartment  of Veterans Affairs (VA)  \n \nAgency Topline.  The  Administration appreciates the $113.1 billion in discretionary  \nappropriations that the Committee provides for VA.  This level would enable the Administration \nto deliver critical investments in high-priority initiatives and infrastructure that would ensure \nveterans receive top quality care, benefits, and services\u2014wherever they work or live.  It would \nsupport key  Administration priorities such as veteran suicide and opioid abuse prevention \nprograms, mental healthcare, and women\u2019s healthcare, while providing the resources needed to  \nassist VA in continuing to address the  challenges  presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The  \nlevel provided would also allow investments in other critical priorities, including homelessness  \nassistance, infrastructure readiness, electronic health record modernization, information \ntechnology  enhancements, and efforts to ensure that VA engrains diversity, equity, and inclusion \ninto the fabric of the  Department.   In addition, the  Administration appreciates that the bill \ncontinues to give VA the flexibility to provide veterans with the robust array  of medical care  \nservices they deserve.  \n \nRelated Agencies  \n \nSupport for Arlington National Cemetery.   The Administration appreciates that the Committee  \nprovided $141 million for the Southern Expansion project at Arlington National Cemetery  \n14 (ANC), as requested in the FY 2022 Budget.  This funding would ensure  ANC continues to honor  \nthe service and sacrifice  of those laid to rest at ANC and their families by  expanding the  \ncemetery\u2019s space and  capacity  well into the future.   \n \nConstitutional  Concerns  \n \nCertain provisions of the  draft bill raise separation of powers  concerns, including by conditioning  \nthe Executive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval  of the House and \nSenate Committees on Appropriations.  The Administration looks forward to working  with the  \nCongress to address these and other  concerns.   \n \n \nDivision G\u2014Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  \nAppropriations Act, 2022 \n \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT)  \n \nOverall Infrastructure Investment Levels.   The Administration strongly supports the bill\u2019s  \nsignificant investments to improve the Nation\u2019s infrastructure, which is aligned with the  \nAdministration\u2019s goals to repair  and rebuild aging  infrastructure, reduce  greenhouse  gas  \nemissions, improve resilience to the  effects of climate change, and invest in disadvantaged \ncommunities.  The bill provides $72 billion in highway, highway safety, and transit formula  \nfunds, equal to the House Transportation Committee\u2019s \u201cINVEST\u201d  Act surface transportation \nauthorization bill.   \n \nFederal Aviation Administration.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided  \n$18.9 billion for Federal  Aviation Administration programs, including $11.4 billion for the safe  \noperation of the National Airspace System (NAS), $3.75 billion in nationwide airport  \ninfrastructure investments, $1 billion for NAS facilities upgrades and replacements, and \n$261 million for emerging technology innovation and climate change mitigation research.   \n \nFederal Transit Administration.  The Administration appreciates the $15.5 billion provided in the  \nbill for public transportation programs to support the Administration\u2019s goals to increase transit  \nState of Good Repair efforts, expand access through the Capital  Investment Grants program, and \nprovide clean transportation alternatives through increased funding for zero-emission vehicles.  \n \nFederal Railroad Administration.  The Administration strongly supports the $4.1 billion provided \nin the bill for the Federal Railroad Administration programs to help spark the next rail revolution, \nincluding a new PRIME  grant program that would support the improvement, expansion, or  \nestablishment of passenger rail service, continued support of Amtrak, and grants for safety and \ninfrastructure improvements to passenger and freight rail.   \n \nNational Infrastructure Investments.  The  Administration appreciates the $1.2 billion provided in \nthe bill for the multi-modal Rebuilding American  Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity   \ngrant program to support  infrastructure projects with a significant local or regional impact.    \n \n15 Thriving Communities.  The Administration appreciates the support the bill provides to the  \nThriving Communities initiative, which would help communities remove obsolete transportation \nbarriers, and increase  access to jobs, schools, and other key areas by better  linking transportation \nand land use decision-making.  \n \nDepartment of  Housing  and Urban Development (HUD)  \n \nHousing Choice Vouchers.  The Administration strongly supports the $29.2 billion provided in \nthe bill for the Housing  Choice Voucher program.  The Administration appreciates the significant \nincrease to expand housing vouchers to an additional 130,000 low-income  households, including  \nfocusing on those who are homeless or fleeing from domestic violence.  The Administration also  \nappreciates the funding to provide mobility services to help families find housing in high-\nopportunity neighborhoods, and renew assistance  for all 2.3 million currently assisted households.  \n \nPublic Housing Fund.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for, and \nsignificant investment in, the Nation\u2019s Public Housing stock by fully funding the  annual operating  \nneeds for 900,000 assisted units, as well as providing $3.7 billion for capital needs  for \nmodernization and addressing health hazards.  The Administration also appreciates the  \n$150 million for investments in energy efficiency  and climate resilience, supporting the  \nAdministration\u2019s priority to tackle the climate crisis.   \n \nHOME Investment Partnerships Program.  The Administration strongly supports the $1.9 billion \nprovided for HOME block grants to support critical investments in the supply  of  affordable  \nhousing, including  a $50 million set-aside to expand sustainable homeownership among first-\ngeneration and/or low-wealth first-time homebuyers.  \n \nHomeless Assistance Grants.   The Administration appreciates the $3.4 billion provided for  \nHomeless Assistance Grants, which fund a variety  of intervention programs that serve homeless  \nand at-risk individuals and families, including survivors of domestic violence and homeless  \nyouth.  This increase would provide assistance to nearly 55,000 additional  individuals  \nexperiencing homelessness.  \n \nSalaries and Expenses  (S&E).  The Administration appreciates the $1.6 billion provided in the  \nbill for HUD S&E, but urges the Congress to fully  fund S&E at the $1.7 billion level requested in \nthe FY 2022 Budget.  The requested level would enable HUD to properly  manage a  growing  \nportfolio of rental assistance, grants, and insured mortgages and deliver on key  Administration \npriorities, including rigorous enforcement of the  Fair Housing  Act.  \n \nConstitutional  Concerns  \n \nCertain provisions of the  draft bill raise separation of powers  concerns, including by conditioning  \nthe Executive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval  of the House and \nSenate Committees on Appropriations.  The Administration looks forward to working  with the \nCongress to address these and other  concerns.   \n  \n16 The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the  FY 2022 appropriations  \nprocess moves forward.  \n \n* * * * * * * \n \n \n \n17 ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND  BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nMarch  3, 2022 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS.J. Res. 38 \u2013 A joint resolution relating to a national emergency \ndeclared by the President on March 13, 2020   \n(Sen.

Therefore, the Administration  strongly opposes  Senate Joint  \nResolution 38, which would terminate the national emergency declared on March 13, 2020, and \nunnecessarily  and abruptly  curtail the ability of the Administration to respond to the COVID-19 \npandemic.  \nCOVID-19 has posed an unprecedented public health challenge for the United States.  Although \nwe have made tremendous progress in combating the virus and are moving forward safely, the  \nvirus continues to pose a  risk to the American people and our health care system.  We must also  \nbe prepared for possible future variants.  \nThe national emergency  enables the Administration to more effectively respond to COVID-19, \nincluding ensuring that  necessary supplies are promptly  available to respond to the virus  and  \nfacilitating the delivery of health care at a time when our health system has  been  under  \ntremendous and prolonged stress.  These authorities are critical not only to continue responding  \nto the Omicron variant, but also to be prepared to respond to potential  future  variants.   Our health  \ncare workforce has been  incredibly  resilient, but after two years of fighting the pandemic we  \nmust continue to do everything we  can to limit the burdens on our health care  \nsystem.  Preventing further strain on our health care workers and their  ability to deliver  care to  \nCOVID patients will also enable treatment of people suffering from other illnesses who are  also  \nput at risk when hospital systems are overwhelmed.  Strengthened by the ongoing declaration of  \nnational emergency, the federal  response to COVID saves lives, improves  health outcomes, \nprevents economic and educational shutdowns, and  supports  the American  economy.  \nActions by Congress to end these authorities abruptly and prematurely would be a reckless and \ncostly mistake.  \nIf Congress were to pass  this resolution, the President would veto it.  \n** * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND  BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nSeptember 27, 2021  \n(House Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT  OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3110  \u2013  PUMP for  Nursing Mothers Act  \n(Rep.  Maloney, D-NY, and 8 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3110, the Providing Urgent \nMaternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act.  No new mother should face unfair \ntreatment in the workplace because  their  employer refuses to provide  them  with reasonable break \ntime and  private, clean  space needed to adequately  express  breast milk  while at work, forcing  \nthem  to choose between their  health and the health of her child, and earning a paycheck. Yet \nmillions of new working  mothers, disproportionately working mothers of color, face this \nchallenge  every day.  \nCongress recognized the importance of ensuring that workers are  able to have the time and space  \nthey need to express breast milk by passing section 4207 of the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, also known as the 2010 Break Time for Nursing Mothers Act.  The PUMP for Nursing  \nMothers Act would ensure that millions of working mothers  previously  excluded from the 2010 \nBreak Time law  are protected.  By  closing this gap, the PUMP for Nursing  Mothers Act will \nensure  millions of nursing mothers have a  clear right to pump at work.  Without these  \nprotections, nursing mothers face serious health consequences, including risk of painful illness \nand infection,  diminished milk supply, or inability  to continue breastfeeding.   \nH.R. 3110  is a bipartisan bill that would also require  employers to pay  an hourly employee for  \nany time spent pumping if the employee is also working.  The  legislation would ensure that \nnursing mothers have access to remedies available for other violations of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act.  Finally, the  PUMP Act also gives employers flexibility to identify solutions that \nwork for their specific business environment.  For example, the bill requires employees to inform \ntheir employers about inadequate space to express breast milk 10 days before  filing  suit for  \nviolating the requirement. \nThe Administration encourages the House to pass this bipartisan, commonsense legislation and \nlooks forward to working with the Congress to  fill the gaps in the law so that all  new mothers  \nwho  choose to breastfeed  are  guaranteed the workplace protections they deserve.  \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nMay  18, 2021  \n(House Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 3233 \u2013 National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack  \non the United States Capitol Complex Act  \n(Rep.

The attack on the Capitol on \nJanuary 6, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on our democracy, an  effort to undo the will of \nthe American people and threaten the peaceful transition of power.

Reed, D-RI, and Sen. Inhofe, R-OK)  \nThe Administration strongly supports enactment of a National Defense Authorization Act \n(NDAA)  for a 61st consecutive  year and is grateful for the strong, bipartisan work this year by  \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee on behalf of America\u2019s national defense.   \nThe Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress to set an appropriate and \nresponsible level of defense spending to support the security of the  Nation.  At the same time, the \nAdministration looks forward to working with Congress to provide appropriate resources for  \nnon-security investments and security investments outside the Department of Defense (DOD).  A  \nstrong economy is critical to ensuring that our Nation is positioned for strategic competition, and \ninvestments in diplomacy,  development, and economic statecraft enhance  the effectiveness of \nnational defense spending and promote national security.  \nThe Administration opposes the direction to add  funding for platforms and systems that cannot \nbe affordably modernized given the need to eliminate wasteful spending  and  prioritize  \nsurvivable, and resilient forces that credibly deter advanced threats.   Our national security  \ninterests require  forces that can fight across the spectrum of conflict.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address its concerns, a number of \nwhich are outlined below.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the classified \nannex to the committee report and working with Congress to address any  concerns about \nclassified programs.  \nOptimizing Program Investments and Modernization.   The Administration strongly opposes \nrestoration of funding to systems that limit DOD\u2019s ability to divest or retire  lower priority  \nplatforms not relevant to tomorrow\u2019s battlefield.  The President\u2019s Budget divests or retires \nvulnerable and costly platforms that no longer meet mission or security needs, and reinvests \nthose savings in transformational, innovative assets that match the dynamic threat landscape  and \nadvance the capabilities of the force of the  future.  The Administration strongly opposes \nlanguage that would limit decommissioning or inactivation of battle force ships before the end of  \ntheir expected service life (section 135)  and retiring A-10 aircraft (section 143). The  \nAdministration also strongly opposes language that would establish minimum inventory  \nrequirements of systems such as tactical airlift and fighter aircraft (sections 141 and 142) and \n1   would authorize unrequested funding  for Expeditionary Fast Transport ships.  Such provisions \nwould limit the  Department\u2019s flexibility to prioritize resource investment, delay modernization of  \ncapabilities, and impede implementation of the  emergent  National Defense  Strategy.   \n \nAfghanistan Security Forces Fund.   Section 1213 provides authorities no longer needed \nfollowing the collapse of the Afghan National Defense and Security  Forces (ANDSF).  \nTherefore, the Administration strongly urges the Senate to adopt  the  language in the  House bill \nto enable the responsible termination of the Afghanistan Security  Forces Fund (ASFF) by  \nauthorizing the use of ASFF  for costs associated with the termination of support to the ANDSF.  \nThe termination will involve, at a minimum, closing out several hundred contracts and, in many  \ncases, negotiating financial settlements with the contractors, developing  a full accounting  for all  \nASFF-funded equipment and supplies that are outside Afghanistan, and assessing amounts and \nthe use of appropriations for potential contract settlement costs and the cost of transporting and \nstoring  ASFF-funded materiel for purposes of treating it as DOD stocks.  More analysis is \nnecessary to develop prudent estimates of these  costs and of timelines for completing these  \nactions.  \n \nRecommendations of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the \nMilitary (IRC).   The Administration commends the determined and bipartisan effort reflected \nby the bill to advance the shared goal of Congress and the Administration to make real and \nsustainable progress on the prevention of  and response to sexual assault and other related crimes, \nand improve support for survivors.  \n   \nThe Administration supports effective implementation of the IRC\u2019s recommendations focused on \naccountability,  improving prevention, climate and culture, and victim care  and support and has \ndeveloped  and instituted  a phased implementation plan to build the foundation and infrastructure  \nnecessary to do so sustainably.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress \nto clarify Sec. 530B, to allow for alignment with the Department of Defense\u2019s ongoing  \nimplementation strategy. Additionally, some of the  IRC\u2019s recommendations  \u2013  such as 4.2 b, \nwhich relates to services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2013  are beyond the  \nauthority of the Secretary of Defense to implement  unilaterally.   \n \nThe Administration is committed to executing military justice  reform, and welcomes efforts by  \nCongress to enact legislation that supports core aspects of the IRC\u2019s recommendations for  \naccountability, namely: that the decision to prosecute  special victim crimes (including, but not  \nlimited to: sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence) be made by Special Victim \nProsecutors (SVPs) within a fully professionalized  judge  advocate organization; that SVPs have  \nthe requisite litigation experience and specialized training to be able to work with victims of \nthese complex, interpersonal crimes; and that each Military Department  establish an Office of the  \nSpecial Victim Prosecutor (OSVP) that can operate with independence from the command  \nreporting structure  and under the direction of the Secretary of the Military  Department, without \nintervening  authority.  The  Administration believes that each Secretary of a Military Department  \nshould have discretion to determine the director of the OSVP, who  may be  a Senior Executive  \nService civilian, best suited to carry out the mission of the Office as determined by that \nSecretary.    \n \n2  \n  To ensure effective reform, the Administration recommends the date prescribed by  section  552, \nso that adequate time is provided to issue necessary  implementing regulations, identify and hire  \nappropriately qualified personnel, train both new and existing personnel, and then place them in \nnewly  created positions.  \n \nAdditionally, effective  reform will require  an increase in the resources committed to the system.  \nAccordingly, the Administration objects to section 564, which would require implementation of \nthe military justice reforms using otherwise-authorized personnel and resources.  The  \nAdministration will work with Congress to determine the appropriate resource level needed to \nensure effective implementation of the revised military justice system.   \n \nIn addition to these recommendations from the  IRC, the Administration urges Congress to enable  \nmilitary protective orders (MPOs) to be given full faith and credit, and enact legislation that \nwould provide DOD  and the Services sufficient time to assess and implement this change.  \n \nLimitation on Modifications to Sexual Assault Reporting Procedures.   The Administration \nstrongly objects to section 566, which would prohibit the Secretary of Defense from amending  \nsection 4 of enclosure 4 of DOD  Instruction 6495.02, relating to Sexual Assault Prevention and \nResponse Program Procedures, \u201cor otherwise prescribe any  regulations or guidance relating to \nthe treatment and handling of unrestricted and restricted reports of sexual assault, until 30 days \nafter notifying the congressional defense  committees of the proposed amendment or  \nmodification.\u201d  This provision  could delay potential needed updates to DOD\u2019s sexual assault  \nregulations.  The administration is committed to working with Congress in a transparent way on \nthese important matters, but must maintain flexibility to amend internal policies when needed.  \n \nAir and Space National Guard.   The Administration does not oppose section 902, which would \nrename the  Air National Guard as the Air and Space National Guard.   This provision would \navoid the significant administrative expenses associated with establishing  a stand-alone Space  \nNational Guard, so DOD can prioritize the development of new space capabilities.   The  \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress on alternative  Space Force  concepts \nthat are efficient, effective, and appropriate for space missions.  \n \nDOD Contractor  Professional Training Material Disclosure Requirements.  The  \nAdministration strongly  opposes section 818, which would require all DOD contractors to post  \nonline or, if they lack an online presence, submit in paper to the Office of the Under Secretary of \nDefense for Acquisition and Sustainment all diversity, equal opportunity, equity, inclusion, or  \ntolerance training materials or internal policies related to these subjects.   This provision would \nrequire the disclosure of intellectual property  and proprietary information.   Furthermore, the \nprovision would be a barrier to entry, especially for small businesses or companies contracting  \nwith the Department for the first time.  This provision, therefore, would limit the number of \nentities willing or able to do business with the Department at a time when access to talent, \ntechnology, and innovation is a critical determinant of the U.S.\u2019s ability to compete.  \n \nLimitations on Use of Funds in the National Defense Sealift (NDS) Fund.   The  \nAdministration strongly  objects to the removal of  funding for used sealift vessels.   The  \nAdministration also urges support for the necessary  relief to recapitalize the sealift fleet with \n3  \n  used vessels by removing existing statutory limitations.   The Administration strongly encourages \nCongress to remove the statutory cap on the number of used sealift vessels DOD can procure and \nto remove the statutory link between the use of NDS funding for the purchase of used vessels \nand the requirement to procure new construction vessels.  This will allow the Administration to \nrecapitalize the sealift fleet, with all used ship conversions taking place  in U.S. shipyards, for a  \nfraction of the cost of procuring new vessels.  \n \nBasic Needs Allowance for Low-Income Regular Members.   The  Administration supports a  \nbasic needs allowance.  The Administration needs a more comprehensive data analysis to \ndetermine the inclusion or exclusion of basic allowance  for housing  when considering the \ncalculation of a basic needs allowance.  Using this analysis, the Administration would like to \nwork with Congress to develop an appropriate calculation for targeting  recipients of a basic \nneeds allowance.   \n \nProhibition on Missile Defense Agency Production of Satellites and Ground  Systems \nAssociated with Operation of  Such Satellites.   The Administration strongly objects to section \n1510, which would prohibit the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) from authorizing or obligating  \nfunding for a program of record for the production of satellites, with an associated limitation of \nfunds. Hypersonic  and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) On-Orbit Prototype  \nDemonstration phase began in January 2021 with contracts awarded to two industry teams.  This \nprogram supports unique missile defense requirements to provide fire-control quality tracking  \ndata on hypersonic  and ballistic missile threats for engagement by missile defense  weapons, and \nis a critical element of the Missile Defense System kill-chain.  Enacting section 1510 would \ndelay delivery of this capability to the warfighter.  Also, consistent with congressional direction, \nthe Secretary of Defense  has certified the Director  of  MDA as the responsible agent for  \ndeveloping the HBTSS capability.  \n \nModification of United  States-Israel Operations-Technology Cooperation within the United  \nStates-Israel Defense Acquisition Advisory Group.   While the Administration strongly  \nsupports strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship, the Administration strongly opposes section \n1271, which would make the United States-Israel Operations-Technology  Working Group \n(OTWG) mandatory.  DOD has developed draft Terms of  Reference for such a  group and is \nfinalizing negotiations with Israel.  However, enactment of section 1271 would eliminate the \nflexibility the Administration needs to ensure that the terms, membership, and focus of the  \nOTWG are in the U.S. interest.  \n \nEnhancement of Recusal for Conflicts of Personal Interest Requirements for Department \nof Defense Officers and  Employees.   The Administration is committed to preventing conflicts \nof interest, but is concerned that section 1103 lacks any mechanism for the  Secretary of Defense  \nto grant a waiver or authorization  to authorize participation when it is in the best interests of the  \nGovernment.   Section 1103 needs to be aligned with existing ethics rules because it introduces \nnew terms, broader standards, and requires the  Department to further screen all DOD personnel \nfrom participating in \u201ccovered matters\u201d involving  clients and competitors of an employee\u2019s \nformer employer for four  years.  Section 1103 would significantly extend the time and resources \nneeded to make decisions and limit DOD\u2019s ability to hire qualified personnel.  \n \n4  \n  Missile Defense Radar in Hawaii.   The Administration opposes added funding for the  \nHomeland Defense Radar \u2013  Hawaii (HDR-H).  The Department had planned to field HDR-H, the  \nPacific Radar, the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), and the Long Range Discrimination Radar by  \nthe mid-2020s as a system of systems to improve  homeland ballistic missile defense.  The Pacific  \nRadar has been delayed indefinitely due to stalled negotiations with the host nation, and the RKV  \nprogram has been cancelled.  Hawaii is currently defended against missile threats to  the same \nextent as the rest of the United States, and DOD is currently investing in other capabilities, such \nas the Next Generation Interceptor, which will support the long-term defense of Hawaii.  \n \nReprioritization of Military Construction  Funding to Unrequested Projects.   The  \nAdministration opposes section 4601, which would realign military  construction funding  \nauthorization from priority  projects to other projects not included in the President\u2019s Budget.  \nContrary to the  Administration\u2019s fiscally  responsible policy to fully fund projects, the bill \nproposes to fund 14 military construction projects incrementally, effectively  creating an \nunfunded obligation of almost $1 billion to complete these projects.  \n \nAlignment of Close Combat Lethality Task Force.  The Administration strongly opposes \nsection 905, which would prevent implementation of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s decision to \nrealign the Close Combat Lethality Task Force (CCLTF) to the Secretary of the Army, effective  \nOctober 1, 2021.  Section 905 would prevent the alignment of the CCLTF  with the organization \nbest positioned to identify, test, develop, demonstrate, and integrate new close combat \ncapabilities, capacity that is already built into the Army\u2019s Maneuver Center of Excellence.  \nImportantly, the CCLTF  will remain a joint organization, with a Tri-Service board governing the \nwork of the CCLTF.  \n \nProhibition on Support for Offensive Military Operations Against the Houthis in Yemen.   \nThe Administration opposes section 1272 because  it is unnecessary; the Administration already  \nhas ceased support for Saudi-led coalition offensive operations in Yemen.  In addition, because  \nDOD does not have the lead for humanitarian aid delivery, the Secretary of Defense is not the  \nappropriate official to provide the requested report.  \n \nProhibition on Reduction of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles of the United States.   The  \nAdministration objects to section 1543, which would restrict the President and the Department of \nDefense from reducing the number of deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles below 400.  \nThe Administration objects to this restriction while the force structure is under review as part of  \nthe ongoing Nuclear Posture Review (NPR).  This language would constrain the President\u2019s \nability to propose the nuclear force he determines is necessary.  \n \nSignificant New Foreign Policy Provisions.   The Administration is concerned that the bill  \nincludes certain sections\u2014specifically 1011, 1201, 1205, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1211, 1242, and \n1275\u2014that would require DOD engagement in, analysis of, or reporting on significant foreign \npolicy issues without including sufficient means for the Secretary of State to provide input and \nensure that foreign assistance is carried out in a manner consistent with foreign policy priorities.  \n \n \n \n5  \n  Coordination Between  United States Cyber Command and Private Sector.   The  \nAdministration opposes section 1604, as this provision\u2019s relationship to section 1642(b) of the \nFY 2019 NDAA is unclear. The Secretary of Defense\u2019s authority to \u201cmake  arrangements with \nprivate sector entities, on a voluntary basis\u201d under section 1642(b) is scoped to the four top \nnation-state threats.  In contrast, section 1604 is not similarly scoped, is not tied to existing  \nauthorities, is arguably duplicative, lacks appropriate coordination with the  Departments of \nJustice and Homeland Security, and may  prohibit internal U.S Government information sharing.  \n \nPilot Program on  Public-Private  Partnerships with Internet Ecosystem  Companies to \nDetect and Disrupt Adversary Cyber Operations.   The Administration opposes section 1605, \nwhich would require the Secretary of Defense to initiate a pilot program to use public-private \npartnerships to facilitate detection and disruption of malicious cyber activity  on private sector \ninfrastructure.  Many of the authorized activities would be achieved more  effectively through \nexisting federal activities, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s Joint  \nCyber Defense Collaborative and several Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law  \nenforcement programs. Establishing a separate pilot program led by  DOD would further \ncomplicate federal efforts to collaborate with the private sector, including  \u201cinternet ecosystem \ncompanies,\u201d in a unified, coordinated manner.  \n \nSafe Drinking Water Act Amendment on Cybersecurity.   The Administration urges support \nfor the requested amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act to enhance cybersecurity  and \nresilience requirements for drinking water systems.  Recent incidents show that cyber-attacks \nand malicious cyber activity against drinking water systems can disrupt and endanger our critical \nwater infrastructure\u2019s ability to provide safe and reliable drinking  water, and put the health and \nlives of our citizens at risk.   \n \nGuantanamo Bay Detention Facility.   The Administration strongly objects to sections 1031, \n1032, and 1033, which  would  extend the prohibitions on the use of funds to: transfer \nGuantanamo Bay Detention Facility (GTMO) detainees to the United States (1031);  construct or \nmodify facilities in the United States to house transferred GTMO detainees (1032);  and transfer \nGTMO detainees to certain countries (1033).  These provisions  would  interfere  with the  \nPresident\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate disposition of GTMO detainees and to make  \nimportant foreign policy  and national security determinations regarding  whether and under what \ncircumstances to transfer detainees to the custody  or effective control of foreign countries.  \n \nConstitutional Concerns.   Certain provisions of the bill, such as section 1232, raise \nconstitutional concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address \nthis and other constitutional concerns.  \n \n* * * * * * *   \n \n6  \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND  BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nJune 22, 2021 \n(House Rules) \nS A P\nTATEMENT  OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R.  2062  \u2013 Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act \n(Rep.

The bipartisan legislation would restore legal protections for \nolder Americans and hold employers accountable for age discrimination.  \nThe bill amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973, to replace the \u201cbut-for\u201d test established in Gross v.

H.R. 6119  would keep the  Federal  Government open and provide  \nmore time for  the  Congress  to reach  a bipartisan agreement on full-year  appropriations bills for  \nfiscal  year (FY)  2022.  \n \nIn May, the President put forward a  budget  proposal  for  FY 2022  that detailed his vision for  \ninvesting in American workers and families, enhancing  American  national  security, and \nadvancing American leadership abroad.   Since then, both the House and Senate majorities have  \nput forward appropriations bills that further these  goals.  The Administration urges the Congress  \nto use the coming weeks  to engage in robust bipartisan negotiations to reach  agreement on  \nappropriations  and avoid the devastating effects of a full-year continuing  resolution.   Full-year  \nappropriations bills are  critical for a wide range of bipartisan priorities\u2014from defense readiness  \nand modernization, to research and development, to veteran benefits  programs.  \n \nThe Administration  appreciates  the $7  billion provided in H.R. 6119  to continue the  interagency  \nefforts  in support of Operation Allies Welcome.   This is a cause that has widespread bipartisan  \nsupport in the  Congress  and with Americans who are working in their  communities to help \nresettle America\u2019s  allies and those at risk.  The additional funding is critical to  ensuring  that the \nUnited States,  having  responsibly  ended  U.S. involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan, can \ncontinue  to  resettle Afghan  partners  and provide  them with  essential services.   \n \nThe Congress has a long  history of reaching bipartisan appropriations agreements that benefit the  \nAmerican people.

Giving  parents  and caregivers additional \nconfidence regarding  the safety  of their  children in these programs is a critical responsibility  of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services  and key to combatting the pandemic  and \nreconnecting  families to needed services.   It is  especially important to provide these added  layers \nof protection for children,  many of whom are under age 5  and do not currently have  access to \nCOVID-19 vaccines.   In addition, it offers  critical  protection for  infants under age 2 in Early  \nHead Start programs who are unable to wear a mask or be vaccinated.

This bipartisan, bicameral legislation \nempowers survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment by  giving them a choice to go to \ncourt instead of being  forced into arbitration. \nUnder current law, many employment and other contracts require binding  arbitration for a wide  \nrange of matters  before  a dispute arises,  which denies survivors the ability  to decide whether to \npursue their claim with the procedural protections provided by  courts, and silences  victims of \nabuse by forcing them into a confidential dispute forum  without the right to appeal.  More than \n60 million Americans are subject  to mandatory arbitration clauses in the workplace, often \nwithout  realizing it  until they  come forward to bring a  claim against their employer.   The  Report \nof the Co-Chairs of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s Select Task Force  \non the Study of Harassment in the Workplace  notes  that between 50-75  percent  of women have  \nfaced some form of unwanted or unwelcome sexual harassment in the workplace.  Additionally, \ncontracts for services may  include mandatory arbitration clauses in the fine print that shield \ncompanies and businesses from being held publicly  accountable for the harm caused. \nThis legislation would  amend the Federal Arbitration Act for disputes involving sexual assault  \nand sexual harassment in order to stop employers  and businesses from forcing employees and \ncustomers  out of the court system and into arbitration.  It would ensure that predispute arbitration \nclauses and  waivers of the right to bring joint actions in cases of sexual assault or sexual \nharassment would not be  valid or enforceable for  cases that are filed under Federal, Tribal, or \nState law.  \nThis legislation advances efforts to prevent and address sexual harassment and sexual assault, \nstrengthen  rights, protect victims, and promote  access to justice.  The Administration is \ncommitted to  eliminating  sexual harassment and assault, and looks forward to working with the  \nCongress on the Ending  Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act as it \nproceeds through the legislative process.

It was built by the middle class, and unions built the  \nmiddle class.  Unions put power in the hands of workers.  They  give workers  a stronger voice to \nincrease  wages, improve  the quality of jobs and protect job security, protect against racial  and all \nother forms of discrimination and sexual harassment, and protect workers\u2019  health, safety, and \nbenefits in the workplace.  Unions lift up workers, both union and non-union.  \nThe policy of the United  States  Government, stated clearly in the National Labor Relations Act, \nis to encourage union organizing and collective bargaining.  However, due to anti-union efforts  \nby many employers for decades, lax enforcement of existing labor laws, and the failure to restore \nand strengthen labor laws to address the real-world of labor-management relations, only 6.3%  \npercent of  private-sector  U.S. wage and salary  workers  were union members in 2020.  \nH.R. 842 would strengthen and protect  workers\u2019 right to form a union by allowing the National \nLabor  Relations  Board (NLRB) to assess penalties on employers who violate workers\u2019 right to \norganize and ensuring  that  workers  who suffer retaliation for exercising these rights  receive  \nimmediate relief.    \nThe PRO Act  also defends  workers\u2019 right to strike\u2014a fundamental economic right\u2014and to \nengage in boycotts and other acts of solidarity with workers  at other companies  without penalty.  \nIt clarifies that employers may not force  employees to waive their  rights  to join together  in \ncollective or class action  litigation.   The bill also closes loopholes in Federal labor law by barring  \nemployers from misclassifying workers as independent contractors and preventing  workers from  \nbeing denied remedies due to their immigration status.   It establishes an expansive  joint \nemployer standard,  allowing workers to collectively  bargain with all the companies that control \nthe terms and  conditions of their employment.  The bill allows unions to collect fair-share fees to  \ncover the  cost of  collective bargaining and administering  a union contract  for all workers  who \nare protected by the contract\u2019s terms.  H.R. 842 restores workers\u2019 access to fair union elections  \nand ensures the results are respected.   The Administration  strongly encourages the House to pass H.R. 842, and looks forward to \nworking  with the Congress to enact  this critical legislation that safeguards  workers\u2019  rights to \norganize and bargain collectively.

Aggressive  efforts to \nanalyze the impact of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\u201cPFAS\u201d)  on  human health and the \nenvironment are necessary  to meet the  challenges associated with developing regulations to \nreduce  exposure to these  substances and improve  public health.  The Administration is pressing  \nforward with targeted actions in its regulatory agenda to achieve this goal, and  looks forward to \nworking  with the sponsors  on this critical issue.  \nAddressing these \u201cforever chemicals\u201d remains one of the most complex environmental \nchallenges of our day due to the number of chemicals, the impacts on human  health, and the  \nwidespread use of PFAS  and their  ubiquity in the  environment.  PFAS are  widely used for their  \nresistance to grease, water, oil, and heat.  They  are most well-known for their applications in \nstain-resistant carpeting, water-resistant clothing, flame-retardant textiles and furniture, non-stick \nand grease-resistant  food contact materials (e.g.,  cookware  and fast food packaging), and \nfirefighting  foam.  PFAS do not break down easily  in the environment or the human body due to \nthe strong  carbon-fluorine bond. Certain PFAS have been found to be associated with  adverse  \nhuman health impacts.  The science surrounding these chemicals continues to evolve at a rapid \npace  and this Administration is working closely with our state,  local, and Tribal  partners  to  take  \nthe appropriate actions necessary to phase out the chemicals that are found to be toxic to human \nhealth and the environment  and to  continue to  develop safe  alternatives for use in life-safety  \napplications like firefighting.  \nThis Administration is committed to keeping pace  with the best available science to protect \npublic health.  We  have taken down the politically compromised toxicity assessment  for  \nperfluorobutane sulfonic  acid (PFBS)  and provided an update that upholds the tenets of scientific  \nintegrity and can be  relied upon for further regulatory  action.

The Administration \ndoes not believe this bill is a genuine effort to counter  Russian aggression or protect Ukraine.   In \nfact, if passed, the legislation would  only serve  to undermine unity  amongst our European  allies \nat a crucial moment when we need to present a unified front  in response to Russian threats \nagainst Ukraine.  The Administration strongly believes any new  sanctions  authority  should  allow \nus to impose maximal costs  on Russia if  it  further invades  Ukraine, in a manner that would \npreserve  Transatlantic unity, which this legislation does not do.   \nThe Administration remains focused on working  with Germany to implement the  July 21  Joint  \nStatement of the United States and Germany on Support for Ukraine, Energy Security, and Our  \nClimate Goals, which includes clear commitments to act  if Russia attempts  to  use  energy  as  a  \nweapon  or  commits  further  aggressive  acts  against  Ukraine, and which the recently elected German \ngovernment continue to implement.   Additionally,  the  Administration  continues  to  implement  the  \nProtecting  Europe\u2019s  Energy  Security  Act,  as  amended.

In state after state, restrictive laws on voting, and \nefforts to replace non-partisan election administration with partisan processes designed to \noverturn the will of the voters,  have  become more widespread.   This landmark legislation is \nneeded to protect the right to vote, ensure  the integrity  of our  elections, and repair  and  strengthen \nAmerican democracy.  \nThe  Freedom to Vote  Act would set common-sense national baselines for voting in Federal \nelections.

It would modernize our election systems, protect election workers, and make  the \nprocess  more secure  against efforts to undermine the will of the people.   Consistent with the  \nAdministration\u2019s commitment to racial equity, the bill would  also expand the tools available to \nthe Justice Department to protect the right of all  Americans  to vote.

The  United States Postal Service  and its dedicated employees  provide an  essential  public  \nservice  and the critical public  infrastructure for the delivery of mail  and packages  to  all  \nAmericans  in  every corner of the  country.   The  Postal Service provides  crucial  support to \nmillions of Americans, including  our Nation\u2019s veterans, including  by  ensuring their ability to \nvote  and  providing  access to prescription medications.  Furthermore, the Postal Service is an \nindispensable complement to and  foundational support for American businesses and \ncommunities.    \nThe Administration supports efforts to strengthen the United States Postal Service,  including by  \nproviding Postal employees with the dignity, fair pay, and employer-provided benefits they have  \nearned.   The Administration is committed to ensuring that the  Postal Service delivers the highest  \nquality, most reliable service possible to every American.   This  legislation would advance these  \ngoals in several ways.  \nUnder current law, the Postal Service is required to annually prepay future retirement health \nbenefits, a requirement not imposed on most other public or private entities.  Consistent with the  \nPresident\u2019s longstanding commitment, H.R. 3076 would repeal this requirement, which unfairly \nand unnecessarily burdens the Postal Service.  \nH.R. 3076 would also  establish a  new, separate  Postal Service Health Benefits Program (PSHBP) \nwithin  the  existing  Federal Employees  Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), that  integrates  Postal  \nemployees and annuitants into Medicare.   Making these changes  would  improve the Postal  \nService\u2019s long-run financial outlook, without sacrificing quality, affordable health coverage  for \nPostal  employees  and retirees.   The Administration is  mindful  that these reforms would  impose  \nadministrative burdens  on the Office of Personnel Management  and FEHBP,  and  further,  that  \nthere  could be  potential challenges  with operationalizing Medicare integration  and with ensuring  \nongoing funding to support administration of  the new PSHPB.   The Administration looks  \nforward to working with Congress to ensure that the goals of H.R. 3076 are met in an  efficient, \nequitable,  and cost-effective manner, while  safeguarding  the  continued stability of the FEHBP.   Finally, H.R. 3076 would  establish  new transparency and reporting requirements for the Postal  \nService and its regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission; require the Postal Service to \nprovide semi-annual reports to Congress on the implementation of its strategic plan; provide for \na public dashboard using nationwide delivery metrics to track delivery performance; and \nmandate  a review of the  costing of competitive and non-competitive products.

Jackson Lee, D-TX, and 182 cosponsors)  \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1620, the Violence Against  \nWomen Reauthorization Act of 2021.  The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is a \nlandmark piece of bipartisan legislation that was first enacted in 1994 and that was reauthorized \nin 2000, 2005, and 2013.  VAWA has transformed the Nation's  response to violence against  \nwomen and has brought  critically needed resources to States, Territories,  Tribes, and local  \ncommunities to help prevent and improve the response to domestic violence, dating violence, \nsexual assault, and stalking.  Strengthening  and renewing VAWA, however, is long overdue.  As  \nmany  as 1 in 3 women are subjected to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and \nstalking at some point in their lives, and the rate is even higher  for women of color, lesbian and \nbisexual  women, and transgender people.  VAWA reauthorization is more urgent now than ever, \nespecially when the pandemic and economic crisis have only further increased the risks of abuse  \nand the barriers to safety  for women in the United States.   \nThe Administration is pleased that H.R. 1620 continues to build upon previous VAWA  \nauthorizations, and includes new provisions to enhance  efforts  and address identified gaps and \nbarriers.   H.R. 1620 would authorize funding for VAWA grant programs for fiscal  years 2022 \nthrough 2026 and would continue to invest in, and expand, strategies that advance access to  \nsafety, justice, and economic stability  for victims and survivors.  The bill would maintain  \nestablished and effective  protections and programs, while also addressing persistent gaps through \nmore holistic approaches in  order to address the complex realities and intersecting issues that \nimpact survivors\u2019 lives.  \nH.R. 1620 would reauthorize grant programs that support the development  of a coordinated \ncommunity response to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking.  It would \nexpand the categories  for which funds may be used in various grant programs to provide  \nadditional pathways to safety  and support for survivors.  Further, the bill seeks to reduce intimate  \npartner homicides  committed with  firearms  by expanding protections for victims and enhancing  \nsupport for law enforcement agencies and courts to improve the enforcement of court orders.  \nThe bill would also improve the health care system\u2019s response to domestic violence, sexual  \nassault, dating violence, and stalking.  \nDomestic violence is  a leading  cause of homelessness for women and their children.  Without the  \nability to access affordable housing, a victim must often times choose between becoming  \nhomeless or remaining in an abusive situation.  H.R. 1620 includes provisions that would  provide  important housing protections  to  allow survivors in federally  assisted housing to relocate  \nto safe housing with victim relocation vouchers, maintain their housing  after a perpetrator leaves, \nor terminate a lease  early.   The bill also  would expand economic security protections for  \nsurvivors.    \n \nH.R. 1620 would  authorize  increased  funding to enhance  culturally specific services for victims. \nThis would include developing  culturally-relevant training  and education programs  for  health \ncare professionals  that are  designed to be inclusive of the experiences of  all individuals,  \nincluding  people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.  It would also include  training  on equity and \nanti-racism approaches to health  services delivery,  disparities in access to health  care services  \nand prevention resources, and current and historic systemic racism in health care services.  \n \nThe Rape Prevention &  Education (RPE) formula grants, administered by the Centers for  \nDisease Control and Prevention, authorize  essential funding to States and  Territories to support  \nrape prevention and education programs conducted by rape crisis centers, sexual assault  \ncoalitions, and other public and private nonprofit entities.  H.R. 1620 would  authorize higher \nlevels of  funding  for prevention through  the RPE program  grants,  as well as  grant programs  \nfocused on prevention efforts with youth administered through the  Department of Justice.  It also  \nwould expand grants to support implementation of training programs to improve the capacity of  \nearly childhood programs to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,  and \nstalking among the families they serve.   H.R. 1620 would also support institutions of higher  \neducation in developing  and disseminating comprehensive prevention education for all students  \nand expanding training for school-based personnel and campus health centers to meet the needs  \nof  young victims of sexual violence.  \n \nThe Administration strongly supports measures in H.R.  1620 that would  expand access to justice \nfor Native American victims.   Native women are victimized at rates higher than any other  \npopulation in the United States, and the vast majority of Native victims report being victimized  \nby a non-native individual.

It contains provisions to create  and maintain additional recreational  \naccess by  authorizing new trails, services,  and facilities.    \nThe legislation contains provisions that protect important public lands, including public lands in \nColorado, through community-supported land use  designations that limit inappropriate  \ndevelopment and maintain recreational access.   It  designates Camp Hale as the Nation\u2019s first  \nNational Historic  Landscape to honor World War II  veterans and Colorado\u2019s  military legacy.  \nFurthermore, it provides  permanent protection of  more than 1 million acres around the Grand \nCanyon National Park from new mining claims.  The Grand Canyon is a majestic national  \ntreasure, drawing Americans from across the country to visit, and numerous  Tribal Nations  \nregard it as  a sacred place. \nH.R. 803 puts in place protections for some of our nation\u2019s most iconic natural and cultural  \nresources and safeguards recreational opportunities for the benefit of current and future  \ngenerations, while  creating jobs and investing in the recreation economy.  It  is also consistent \nwith the recommendation of scientists that, to safeguard the health and productivity of the natural  \nsystems upon which we all depend, the Nation  must pursue a  goal of  conserving at least 30 \npercent of U.S. lands and ocean by 2030.

This bipartisan legislation \nwould terminate the October 16, 2002, statutory authorization for the use of military force \nagainst Iraq. \nThe Administration supports the repeal of the 2002 AUMF, as the United States has no ongoing \nmilitary activities that rely solely on the 2002 AUMF as a domestic legal basis, and repeal of the \n2002 AUMF would likely have minimal impact on current military operations.

In the face of rising violence targeting LGBTQI+ persons around the \nworld, the Administration recognizes that LGBTQI+ persons face serious and unique threats to \ntheir safety due to their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex \ncharacteristics.  While many countries have made tremendous strides in embracing equality for \nLGBTQI+ community members, others remain stagnant or, worse, are undertaking steps to \nfurther marginalize or harm LGBTQI+ community members.   \nTo address these threats, the Administration has taken historic actions to accelerate the march \ntoward full LGBTQI+ equality at home and abroad.

These actions serve to \ndemonstrate that the Administration is a consistent and reliable partner in the fight for equality at \nhome and abroad.  Globally, the Administration\u2019s efforts are guided by the Presidential \nMemorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World.  To \nfurther guide implementation of the Memorandum, President Biden appointed the Special Envoy \nto Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons and ensured that Pride flags fly at  U.S. \nEmbassies and Consulates.  Collectively, these actions demonstrate United States leadership in \nsupport of LGBTQI+ human rights around the world.  \nH.R. 3485 is a bi-partisan bill that would, among other provisions, require the Administration to \nprovide Congress with a list of foreign individuals found responsible for human rights violations \nagainst LGBTQI+ persons abroad.  Individuals included on this list would be ineligible for visas \nto, or entry into, the United States.  While the sentiments reflected in this bill are deeply shared, \nthe Administration urges Congress to ensure that the policies provide appropriate flexibility to \nact in the national interest.     \nWhile this legislation focuses on foreign persons  and foreign affairs, the Administration also \nbelieves too many  LGBTQI+  people  across our nation continue facing discrimination and hate, \nespecially  LGBTQI+ people of color and transgender people.

During that \nmonth, CDC is working with other government agencies to help inform a revised policy  \nframework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public  \ntransportation corridor going forward.  CDC has stated that this revised framework will be based \non the COVID-19 community levels, risk of new variants, national data, and the latest science. \nCDC will communicate any updates publicly to the approach to mask requirements based on the \nresults of this science-based process.  \nPublic transportation and transportation hubs are places where people across communities \ncongregate, often for extended periods and in close quarters.   The determination of the timeline  \nand circumstances under which masks should be required in these settings should be guided by  \nscience, not politics.  \nIf Congress were to pass this resolution, the President would veto it.  \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND  BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nDecember 7, 2021 \n(Senate)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT  OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS.J.

If Congress were to  pass  this resolution \nof disapproval, the President\u2019s advisors would strongly  recommend that he  veto the resolution.  \nThe COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing  ETS  is necessary  to protect workers from the grave  \ndanger that they  face in their workplace  during  the devastating COVID-19  pandemic.   The  \nPresident wants to see  Americans back on the job, and Americans back at work  should not face  \nrisk from those who are  not  vaccinated and  who  refuse  to be tested.  \nIn 1970, President Nixon signed the Occupational Safety  and Health Act to give  the Department  \nof Labor\u2019s  Occupational Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA) the responsibility to issue an \nemergency standard when workers are  faced with a grave danger  such as  COVID-19.  Relying  \non the latest science, OSHA\u2019s ETS, once  fully implemented, would  give large  employers the \nchoice between adopting  either:  1) a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy; or 2) a policy  \nrequiring employees to get vaccinated or  take  a COVID-19 test  on at least a weekly basis  and \nwear a face  covering at work.  \nThe vast majority of adults are fully vaccinated, and thus  face no burden from implementation  of \nthe OSHA rule.  The  rule exempts small businesses, which likewise face no burden from the  \nrule.  What the rule does do is provide  a common-sense protection for  workers at large firms.  At \na time when COVID is on the rise, a new variant is on the loose, and more  Americans are  \nchoosing to be vaccinated, it makes no sense for  Congress to reverse this much-needed \nprotection of our workforce.  It puts our recovery in  danger, and a vote for this resolution risks a  \nreturn to shutdowns, layoffs, and closures that  result from allowing COVID  to spread more  \neasily in the workplace.

The Administration  appreciates  the $148 million increase provided \nfor Juvenile Justice Programs, but urges the Congress to consider providing an additional  \n$302  million to match the  FY 2022 Budget request, including full funding for the Community-\nBased  Alternatives to  Incarceration program.  \n \nGuantanamo Bay.  The Administration  appreciates that the bill supports the  FY 2022 Budget  \nrequest to remove provisions that effectively prohibit the closure of facilities at United States  \nNaval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.   \n \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  \n \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).   The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s strong support for NASA.  The $25 billion provided in the bill would  enhance \nNASA\u2019s Earth science and aeronautics  work to address the climate crisis, enable the Artemis  \nprogram to land American astronauts on the Moon, and expand STEM engagement efforts.  The \nresult would  be a robust  and inspirational space program that addresses the critical challenges of  \nour times.  \n \n \n3  \n  National Science  Foundation (NSF)  \n \nNSF Topline.   The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s strong support for NSF\u2019s  climate  \nand clean energy R&D, broadening participation programs, and the  creation of the new  \nDirectorate to speed the transfer of NSF\u2019s discoveries into innovations that would benefit the \nAmerican people.  However, the  Administration urges the Congress to provide the full FY 2022 \nBudget request  that would enable NSF to make further contributions to U.S. innovation and \ntechnological competitiveness.   \n \nLegal Services Corporation (LSC)  \n \nLSC  Topline.  The Administration strongly supports  the $600  million provided to LSC  to enhance \nits COVID-19 pandemic response, which is equal  to the  FY 2022 Budget  request.  These funds \nwould expand access to  civil legal aid  and are  critical to assisting low-income individuals with  \nresponding to legal issues, including those  driven by the  COVID-19 pandemic.    \n \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission  (EEOC)  \n \nEEOC Topline.  The Administration appreciates  that  the  Committee provides  the full FY 2022 \nBudget request  for the  EEOC, which would help restore critical agency staff lost in recent  years  \nand finance key investigative, regulatory, and enforcement resources necessary to protect the  \nNation\u2019s workers from workplace discrimination.    \n \nConstitutional  Concerns  \n \nSections 509, 518, and 526 would in certain applications intrude upon the  President\u2019s  \nconstitutional authority over international diplomacy.  The Administration looks forward to \nworking with the  Congress to address these and other concerns.   \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the  FY 2022 appropriations  \nprocess moves forward.  \n \n* * * * * * *  \n \n \n4  \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nApril  27, 2021  \n(Senate Floor)  \nS O A P  \nTATEMENT  F  DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nS. 914 \u2013  Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure  Act of 2021 \n(Sen. Duckworth,  D-IL, and 13  cosponsors)  \nThe Administration supports Senate passage of S. 914, the Drinking Water and Wastewater  \nInfrastructure Act of 2021.  This legislation aligns with the  Administration\u2019s goals to upgrade  \nand modernize aging infrastructure, improve the health of children and small and disadvantaged \ncommunities, develop new technologies, and help address cybersecurity  threats  and mitigate  \ndangers from climate change.  \nAcross the country, pipes and treatment plants are  aging, undermining the reliable delivery of  \nsafe drinking water and allowing polluted wastewater to endanger public health and the \nenvironment.  Large portions of U.S. water and wastewater systems were built over a century  \nago.  As pipes and plants reach the end of their expected lifespan, they must be upgraded and \nreplaced.  An estimated six to ten million homes still receive drinking water through lead pipes \nand service lines.  \nS. 914 authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s core water infrastructure funding \nprograms and continues the commitment to partnering with States, Tribes, and territories to \ninvest in infrastructure projects in communities across the United States, ensuring that all \nAmericans, especially those living  in underserved communities, have access to safe and clean \nwater and opportunities for economic  growth.  S. 914 authorizes programs to address lead pipes \nand service lines in our drinking water systems.  It supports small, disadvantaged, and rural \ncommunities, including Tribal communities,  through grant programs that promote environmental \njustice.  S. 914 authorizes increased funding levels and provides program flexibilities to enable \ninvestments in water projects that address aging infrastructure, improve  availability and access to \ndrinking water and wastewater services, and improve water quality.  It authorizes programs to \nconnect households to public water and wastewater services, provide technical assistance on \ndecentralized wastewater systems, and improve sanitation in rural Alaska and Alaska Native \nvillages.  S. 914 promotes resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate change and makes \nexplicit that cybersecurity  projects are eligible for key programs.  The legislation also authorizes \nfunding to address recruitment, training, and retention challenges facing the water  and \nwastewater utility workforce. \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this bipartisan legislation to \nstrengthen our nation\u2019s water systems.   This bill is a good start to the much-needed funding  \nrequired to  provide  communities with the water quality they deserve  and create good-paying  \njobs.   ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nSeptember 21, 2021 \n  (House) \nS A P  \nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nH.R. 4350 \u2013 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 \n(Rep. Smith, D-WA, and Rep. Rogers, R-AL) \nThe Administration strongly supports enactment of a National Defense Authorization Act \n(NDAA) for a 61st consecutive year and is grateful for the strong, bipartisan work this year by \nthe House Armed Services Committee on behalf of America\u2019s national defense.   \nThe Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress to set an appropriate and \nresponsible level of defense spending to support the security of the Nation.  At the same time, the \nAdministration looks forward to working with Congress to provide appropriate resources for \nnon-security investments and security investments outside the Department of Defense (DOD).  A \nstrong economy is critical to ensuring our Nation is positioned for strategic competition, and \ninvestments in diplomacy, development, and economic statecraft enhance the effectiveness of \nnational defense spending and promote national security. \nThe Administration opposes the direction to add funding for platforms and systems that cannot \nbe affordably modernized given the need to prioritize survivable, lethal, and resilient forces in \nthe current threat environment and eliminate wasteful spending.  Our national security interests \nrequire forces that can fight across the spectrum of conflict.   \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address its concerns, a \nnumber of which are outlined below.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the \nclassified annex to the committee report and working with the Congress to address any concerns \nabout classified programs. \nOptimizing Program Investments and Modernization.  The Administration strongly opposes \nrestoration of funding to systems that limit DOD\u2019s ability to divest or retire lower priority \nplatforms not relevant to tomorrow\u2019s battlefield.  The President\u2019s Budget divests or retires \nvulnerable and costly platforms that no longer meet mission or security needs, and reinvests \nthose savings in transformational, innovative assets that match the dynamic threat landscape and \nadvance the capabilities of the force of the future.  The Administration strongly opposes \nlanguage limiting retirement or inactivation of Ticonderoga Class Cruisers (section 1017).  The \nAdministration also strongly opposes language that would establish minimum inventory \nrequirements of systems such as the KC-10 (section 133) and tactical airlift aircraft (section \n134), which would limit the Department\u2019s flexibility to prioritize resource investment, delay \nmodernization of capabilities, and impede implementation of the National Defense Strategy. \n1   \n \nAfghanistan Security Forces Fund.  The Administration appreciates the authority provided in \nsection 1212 to enable the responsible termination of the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund \n(ASFF).  The termination will involve, at a minimum, closing out several hundred contracts and \nin many cases negotiating financial settlements with the contractors, developing a full accounting \nfor all ASFF-funded equipment and supplies that are outside Afghanistan, and assessing \npotential contract settlement costs and the cost of transporting and storing ASFF-funded materiel \nfor purposes of treating it as DOD stocks.  More analysis is necessary to develop prudent \nestimates of these costs and of timelines for completing these actions.  \n \nRecommendations of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault (IRC).  The \nAdministration commends the determined effort to advance our shared goal of making real \nprogress on preventing and, when prevention fails, improving the response to sexual assault and \nother related crimes, as well as supporting survivors.  Additionally, the Administration \nappreciates the willingness to build rapidly on the work of the IRC by seeking to enshrine many \nof its recommendations in law and looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure these \nrecommendations are implemented effectively and achieve their intended results.   \n \nSection 533, as currently written, would require each Service\u2019s Office of Special Victim \nProsecutors (OSVP) to be headed by a general or flag officer who would report directly to the \nSecretary of the Military Department concerned, without intervening authority.  To preserve the \nSecretaries\u2019 discretion, the Administration believes that language should be added to this section \nto allow the Secretary of a Military Department to choose a supervisor of the OSVP that is a \nSenior Executive Service civilian with equivalent experience.  \n \nThe Administration recommends amendments to the qualification standards in section 532 in \norder to permit otherwise highly-qualified judge advocates at the grade of O-5 or higher to be \nable to serve as a Special Victim Prosecutor (SVP) in light of limitations on the number of \npersonnel at grade O-6 or higher currently available to fill these positions.  Additionally, the \nAdministration recommends requiring a minimum of three years of relevant criminal justice \nexperience for Assistant SVPs, due to the challenges of ensuring sufficient personnel with five or \nmore years of experience.  Though the Administration sees great benefit in facilitating victim \naccess to protective orders and maximizing such orders\u2019 effectiveness, the Administration \nbelieves that additional time is needed in order to study the military judicial resources \nimplications of the changes proposed in section 529.  The Administration recommends requiring \nthe completion of an implementation study within one year of enactment, followed by the \nrequirement to develop regulations implementing this section within two years of enactment.  \nFinally, the Administration urges Congress to pass its requested sexual harassment punitive \narticles.  \n \nOther Military Justice Measures.  Though the Administration similarly appreciates the \ncommitment to further improving the military justice system, the Administration opposes \nprovisions that could have unintended and deleterious impacts on the administration of justice \nand DOD\u2019s related programs.  The Administration strongly opposes section 517 as currently \nwritten, which authorizes the Secretaries of the Military Departments to act on characterization \nof service determinations notwithstanding the separation board\u2019s recommendation, and \n2   \nrecommends that a study be undertaken instead to assess potential changes.  Further, the \nAdministration is concerned that military criminal investigative organizations (MCIOs) lack the \npersonnel and resources to complete section 528\u2019s notification requirement within 180 days.  \nMany of the individuals who would have to be notified are no longer in the military and MCIOs \nwould have to conduct a search for their current contact information.  Therefore, the 180-day \ntimeframe is not feasible.  \n \nSpace National Guard (SNG).  The Administration strongly opposes the creation of a Space \nNational Guard.  When the Space Force was established, Congress and the Administration alike \nemphasized the need to minimize administrative expenses and prioritize the development of \nspace capabilities; this Administration remains committed to that approach.  Establishing a Space \nNational Guard would not deliver new capabilities\u2014it would instead create new government \nbureaucracy, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates could increase costs by up to \n$500 million annually.  The Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units with space missions \nhave effectively performed their roles with no adverse effect on DOD\u2019s space mission since the \nestablishment of the Space Force.  The Administration looks forward to working with the \nCongress on alternative Space Force concepts that are efficient, effective, and appropriate for \nspace missions. \n \nLimitations on Use of Funds in the National Defense Sealift Fund.  The Administration urges \nsupport for the necessary relief to recapitalize the sealift fleet with used vessels by removing \nexisting statutory limitations.  The Administration strongly encourages Congress to remove the \nstatutory cap on the number of used sealift vessels DOD can procure and to remove the statutory \nlink between the use of National Defense Sealift funding for the purchase of used vessels and the \nrequirement to procure new construction vessels. This will allow the Administration to \nrecapitalize the sealift fleet, with all used ship conversions in U.S. shipyards, for a fraction of the \ncost of procuring new vessels. \n \nF-35 Sustainment Costs. The Administration strongly opposes section 141, as it places artificial \nconstraints on F-35 aircraft inventory using outdated and unrealistic fiscally-constrained F-35A \naffordability targets. Based on current F-35 sustainment cost estimates, DOD does not see a \nrealistic path to reach the $4.1 million (Constant Year 2012 dollars) cost per tail per year \naffordability target for the F-35A.  \n \nBasic Needs Allowance For Low-Income Regular Members.  The Administration supports a \nbasic needs allowance. The Administration needs a more comprehensive data analysis to \ndetermine the inclusion or exclusion of basic allowance for housing. Using this analysis, the \nAdministration would like to work with Congress to develop an appropriate calculation for \ntargeting recipients of a basic needs allowance.    \n \nCountering Extremism in the Armed Forces.  The Administration shares the goal of \npreventing prohibited extremist activities and holding offenders accountable, but opposes section \n529A, because it would impose onerous and overly specific training and data collection \nrequirements and would foreclose other options to address extremism. \n \n3   \nProhibition on Adverse Personnel Actions Taken Against Certain Members of the Armed \nForces Based on Declining COVID-19 Vaccine and Expansion of Exemptions from \nVaccination Requirement.  The Administration strongly opposes section 716, which would \ndetract from readiness and limit a commander\u2019s options for enforcing good order and discipline \nwhen a Service member fails to obey a lawful order to receive a vaccination.  To enable a \nuniformed force to fight with discipline, commanders must have the ability to give orders and \ntake appropriate disciplinary measures.  The Administration also strongly opposes section 720, \nwhich would create a new and overly broad exemption from the vaccination requirement for \nprevious infection that would undermine the effectiveness of the requirement.  The Department \nwill make available a full range of resources to Service members, including individual and \nprofessional medical advice, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine \nand to ensure they are fully informed about vaccination. \n \nMinimum Wage for Employees of Department of Defense Contractors.  Although the \nAdministration supports contract workers and increasing the minimum wage for workers under \nfederal contracts, it objects to section 804 because it is inconsistent with E.O. 14026, \u201cIncreasing \nthe Minimum Wage for Federal Contractors.\u201d  Different application depending on whether or not \nthe contract is with DOD or another Federal department or agency would lead to significant \nconfusion by applying different requirements to many of the same contractors \n \nGlobal Bulk Fuel Management and Delivery.  The Administration strongly opposes section \n342, which would designate a single combatant command to be responsible for global bulk fuel \nmanagement and delivery.  This designation would not address the challenges posed by the \ndegraded availability and survivability of assets supporting the distribution of fuel to dispersed \nand austere operating locations and the need for rapid decision-making in support of changing \noperational environments. It would also introduce significant risk by degrading the Joint Force\u2019s \nability to meet operational requirements.  \n \nModification of Restriction on Department of Defense Procurement of Certain Items \nContaining Perfluorooctane Sulfonate or Perfluorooctanoic Acid.  The Administration is \ncommitted to working with Congress to address the challenges posed by per- and polyfluoroalkyl \nsubstances (PFAS).  However, it is concerned with section 317 which would prohibit DOD from \nprocuring a wide range of items that may contain PFAS.  If implemented in its current form, it \nwould not be feasible for DOD to test all of these items to determine if they contain PFAS.  In \naddition, some of these products may not have PFAS-free alternatives available.  The \nAdministration will continue to work with Congress to both address PFAS contamination and \nfind alternative products and solutions. \n \nInformation Regarding Solicitation and Award of Subcontracts Under Military \nConstruction Contracts.  The Administration strongly opposes section 2803, which would \ncreate burdensome new information collection and reporting requirements that would impose an \nunfunded mandate on industry while contradicting the Paperwork Reduction Act and providing \nno benefit to project execution.  \n \n \n4   \nLimitation on Availability of Funds for the B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement \nProgram (CERP).  The Administration strongly opposes section 132, which would limit the \navailability of funds for the B-52 CERP and establish a premature and inadequate cost estimate \nfor the program.  This would delay the CERP and postpone delivery of new commercial engines \nfor the B-52 by up to two years.  Such a delay from 2029 to 2031 would exceed the projected \n2030 end of life for the current B-52 TF-33 engines and add risk to B-52 availability.   \n \nMissile Defense Radar in Hawaii.  The Administration strongly opposes the requirement in \nsection 1643 to certify funding for the Homeland Defense Radar \u2013 Hawaii (HDR-H).  The \nDepartment had planned to field HDR-H, the Pacific Radar, the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), \nand the Long Range Discrimination Radar by the mid-2020s as a system of systems to improve \nhomeland ballistic missile defense.  The Pacific Radar has been delayed indefinitely due to \nstalled negotiations with the host nation, and the RKV program has been cancelled.  Hawaii is \ncurrently defended against missile threats to the same extent as the rest of the United States, and \nDOD is currently investing in other capabilities, such as the Next Generation Interceptor, which \nwill support the long-term defense of Hawaii.  \n \nAuthority of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security to Engage in \nFundraising for Certain Nonprofit Organizations.  The Administration strongly opposes \nsection 1613, which runs counter to longstanding law and policy that prohibits Federal personnel \nfrom fundraising on behalf of non-Federal entities.  This would unnecessarily and improperly \nentangle senior DOD personnel in the fundraising and operations of potentially numerous non-\nFederal entities.  \n \nReprioritization of Military Construction Funding to Unrequested Projects.  The \nAdministration opposes the bill\u2019s realignment of military construction funding from priority \nprojects to other projects.  Contrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible policy to fully \nfund projects, the bill proposes to fund 12 military construction projects incrementally, \neffectively creating an unfunded obligation of almost $900 million needed to fully fund these \nprojects over time.  The bill diverts these funds to other unrequested projects. \n \nFallon Range Training Complex (FRTC) Modernization.  The Administration urges \nCongress to adopt DOD\u2019s request to expand the FRTC to provide the area needed to fully \naccommodate modern military training requirements while upholding Tribal trust responsibilities \nand responsible management of public lands.  \n \nModernization of the Selective Service System.  The Administration supports section 513 and \nthe registration requirement for all citizens, which further ensures a military selective system that \nis fair and just.  However, the Administration opposes the removal in subsection (f) of Federal \nincentives for registration, which must remain to achieve an equitable system that can be \nimplemented effectively. \n  \n \n \n \n5   \nNuclear Weapons Provisions.  The Administration opposes several provisions that would pre-\njudge the outcome of the Nuclear Posture Review now underway.  These include the prohibition \non funding for extending the service life of the B83-1, the restrictions on changing \nintercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) alert levels or the number of deployed ICBMs, and the \nprohibition on reconverting or retiring W76-2 warheads. \n \nDefense Review Requirements.  The Administration objects to requirements in section 1653, \nwhich purport to require the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Vice Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, and the U.S. STRATCOM Commander to provide pre-decisional and \ndeliberative materials associated with the Integrated Deterrence Review, as well as the Nuclear \nPosture Review and Missile Defense Review.  These requirements encroach on the constitutional \nprerogatives of the President. \n \nSignificant Foreign Policy Provisions Relevant to Defense Matters.  The Administration is \nconcerned that the bill includes certain provisions requiring DOD engagement in, analysis\u202fof, or \nreporting on significant foreign policy issues, that lack a sufficient means for State involvement \nand looks forward to working with Congress on these matters. \n \nAnomalous Health Incidents.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s continued \nengagement on anomalous health incidents and would like to work with the Congress to \nreconcile structural and reporting requirement differences between these sections and other \nproposed legislation in order to standardize inter-agency processes, increase multi-committee \nreporting, and increase pro-active care options to affected individuals. \n \nConstitutional Concerns.  Certain provisions of the bill, such as sections 901 and 1232, raise \nconstitutional concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address \nthese and other constitutional concerns.   \n \n6  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND  BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nMay  10, 2022   \n(House Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT  OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5129  \u2013  Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act of  2022  \n(Rep. Bonamici, D-OR, and 126  cosponsors)  \nThe  Administration supports  the poverty-fighting  goals of H.R. 5129, the Community Services \nBlock Grant Modernization Act of 2022, to provide  states, territories, and Tribes with resources \nfor critical community services.   This  legislation  will  reauthorize the Community Services Block \nGrant (CSBG) for  a decade  and help  ensure  that communities have the tools they need to fight \npoverty  and build economic mobility.  \nThe CSBG has been supporting  tribal and local governments and community organizations \nacross the country for over 50 years with funding  to help them serve low-income individuals and \nfamilies.  Local administration of some of the most essential community programs\u2014such as job \ntraining and placement, food and nutrition assistance, Head Start, housing  and homelessness \nassistance, and the Low Income Home  Energy Assistance Program\u2014is supported by  CSBG \nfunds.  While these services and strategies have always been key to helping Americans get ahead \nand stay  ahead, the COVID-19 pandemic  underscored just how vital  it is to invest in the \norganizations that deliver them.  Faced with unprecedented demand and the  operational \nchallenges of the pandemic, the more than 1,000 organizations supported by  CSBG continued \nworking to help low-income communities address housing and food insecurity, provide high-\nquality early childhood education, and support individuals re-entering the  workforce.  Now, as \nthis Administration works to build a strong and equitable recovery, it is more important than ever \nto invest in in locally based solutions to the causes and conditions of poverty  in communities.  \nThe  CSBG update proposed by this Act  would result in  greater equity for Tribes, expanded \nincome eligibility  data modernization, strengthened performance management, and support for \ncommunity-based services and strategies.  In addition, this Act would support new broadband \nnavigator efforts and continues critical support for community  economic development and rural \ndevelopment activities.  And reauthorizing CSBG for the first time since 1998 would provide \norganizations and the millions of families they serve with the  confidence  and stability to make  \nthe long-term investments communities  need.   \nThe Administration looks forward to working with Congress to  ensure that  this  bipartisan  \nlegislation  achieves its purposes,  continues  expanding  opportunity  for all  Americans, and \nultimately is enacted.  \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND  BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \nFebruary 28, 2022  \n(House  Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT  OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R.  3967 \u2013  Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act  \n(Rep. Takano, D-California and 100  cosponsors) \nThe Administration strongly  supports H.R. 3967,  which would expand veterans\u2019  access to health \ncare  and benefits to address the health effects of harmful environmental exposures that occurred \nduring military service.  \nThe President believes that our  Nation  has only one truly sacred obligation: to properly prepare  \nand equip our service members when we send them into harm\u2019s way and to care  for them and \ntheir families when they  return home.   Far too often, military service  comes with a cost, and we  \nowe it to our veterans and their families to address these consequences  comprehensively. \nUnfortunately, it has taken decades to understand the deleterious effects of environmental \nexposures\u2014leaving too many without access to the benefits and services they need.  \nH.R.  3967  would make changes to the definitions for who is eligible for VA health care based on \npresumed toxic exposure during military service, including  from burn pits,  radiation, or other \nenvironmental conditions.   H.R. 3967 would also  make changes to the Department of Veteran \nAffairs (VA\u2019s)  process for determining  presumptive  service  connection and  mandate several  \nresearch studies related to military related environmental exposures. It would also establish new \nregistries related to exposures, which would provide new data on the long-term impacts from \nenvironmental exposures.   H.R. 3697 also would  allow a  Federal cause of action related to \ncontaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina  and establish training requirements for \nhealth providers,  and require  an outreach plan to educate veterans about their eligibility for  \nbenefits and services  related to toxic exposure.  \nThe Administration looks forward to working  with the Congress to  enact this legislation  and \nensuring it is effectively implemented.  We  must  address the toxic legacy of environmental \nexposures sustained by  veterans during their military service  and fulfill our sacred obligation to \nour veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors.

DeLauro, D-CT) \nThe Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 5305, the Extending Government Funding \nand Delivering Emergency Assistance Act.  \nH.R. 5305 would keep the federal government open, provide disaster relief, and avoid a \ncatastrophic default so that the government can continue serving the American people without \ninterruption as we continue to confront a pandemic, recover from and respond to disasters, and \npower an economic recovery.  At the same time, the window provided by this short-term \nContinuing Resolution will allow movement toward bipartisan agreement on smart, full-year \nappropriations bills for fiscal year 2022 that reinvest in core priorities, meet the needs of \nAmerican families, businesses, and communities, and lay a strong foundation for the future.  \nIn addition to providing short-term funding for core government operations, H.R. 5305 provides \n$6.3 billion in emergency spending to support Operation Allies Welcome, a multifaceted, \nhistoric interagency mission.  The operation to move out of danger and to safety tens of \nthousands of Afghans at risk, including many who helped us during our two decades in \nAfghanistan, represents an extraordinary military, diplomatic, security, and humanitarian \noperation by the U.S. Government.  The Administration appreciates the funding provided to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement to provide \nresettlement and essential support services to individuals relocated to the United States from \nAfghanistan, as well as legislative language that would make these individuals eligible for \nfederal benefits.  However, the Administration is deeply disappointed that the bill fails to provide \nthe authority requested to fully resettle Afghans, and to adjust their status, thereby obstructing \nthem in building successful new lives in their new communities in the United States.  \nThe Administration also strongly supports the $28.6 billion in disaster relief funding to help \nimpacted states and tribes recover from recent extreme weather events and natural \ndisasters.  This includes disasters from the last 18 months\u2014such as Hurricanes Laura and \nDelta\u2014for which there are remaining unmet needs.  We also appreciate the down payment for \nmore recent disasters, including wildfires and Hurricane Ida. \nFinally, the Administration strongly supports suspending the debt limit until December 2022, \nwhich will preserve the full faith and credit of the United States and avoid a catastrophic \ndefault.  The length of this suspension represents obligations that bipartisan majorities in \nCongress strongly supported incurring last year as part of this nation\u2019s response to COVID\u2014 indeed, bipartisan majorities even took public credit for incurring these necessary \nexpenses.  Having led and passed legislation authorizing these expenses, these same bipartisan \nmajorities should honor the obligation to fund them.  Suspending the debt limit allows the \nTreasury to finance spending Congress has already authorized and to keep its commitments \nwithout causing disruption or harm to our economy and families.

Schiff, D-CA, and 168  cosponsors)  \nThe  Administration  supports  House  passage  of  H.R. 5314,  the Protecting Our Democracy  Act.  \nIn the last several years, our democracy  has experienced sustained attacks, even before  an armed \nmob sought to overturn the  will  of the people in a  duly certified election  and a wave of voter \nsuppression  laws  swept state legislatures.   Our  constitutional structure is designed to preserve  \ndemocracy and prevent authoritarianism.  That promise is imperiled when a  President places \nhimself above the law, disregards the  separation  of  powers, retaliates against  legitimate \nwhistleblowers, allows corruption to take hold, or enables foreign interference in our elections.   \nThe Protecting Our Democracy  Act seeks to restore the rule of law and create  new guardrails  to  \nprevent  such abuses of power.    \nThe Administration applauds the  sponsors\u2019  preparation of  a bill devoted to the formidable, but \nessential, challenge of reinforcing the norms and safeguards that prevent our democracy from \neroding.   The  Administration will continue  to work  with Congress  throughout the legislative  \nprocess to pass a bill  that is grounded in constitutional principles  and a  commitment to \nprotecting  and improving our democracy, and that appropriately  addresses the balance of powers \nbetween the three branches of our  Federal government, including  by upholding the longstanding  \ninterests of the Executive Branch that are essential to effective  governance  and efficient use of \ntaxpayer resources  and consistent with our constitutional structure.   In doing so, the  \nAdministration will work to ensure that no branch  of government  is able to abuse its authority or \nundermine a co-equal branch\u2019s constitutional prerogatives, no matter who is in power.   \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n  OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND  BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, DC  20503  \n \nJuly 27, 2021  \n(House Rules)  \nS A P  \nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R.  4373 \u2014  Department of State,  Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  \nAppropriations Act,  2022  \n(Rep. DeLauro, D-CT)  \n \nThe Administration  strongly  supports House passage of H.R. 4373, making  appropriations for the  \nDepartment of State,  Foreign Operations, and Related Programs for the fiscal  year  (FY) ending  \nSeptember 30, 2022, and for other purposes.  \n \nOver the past decade, due in large measure to overly restrictive budget  caps, the Nation  \nsignificantly underinvested in core priorities such as education, research, and public health that  \nare vital to our prosperity and strength.  We have seen the consequences of this broad \ndisinvestment in our lack of preparedness to effectively respond to a  global  pandemic.  We see it  \nin global competitors that are catching up or even surpassing the  United States in  research and  \ndevelopment.  In addition, we see it in longstanding inequities that have been deepened by  \nchronic underinvestment in programs that are drivers of opportunity, such as Head Start and K-12 \neducation.  These cuts to public investment in basic services and protections have cost us all\u2014and \nthe moment to begin reversing this troubling trend is now.  \n \nThe Administration is eager to incorporate the best ideas to reinvest in America.  What we  cannot  \naccept is a continuation of damaging and self-defeating disinvestment.  Instead, we must seize  \nthis moment to invest in our future\u2014building  an economy that works for  everyone, not just those  \nat the top; tackling the  generational challenge of  climate change; competing with rising powers  \nand maintaining our position as a global leader; and preparing for the full range of challenges  and \nopportunities ahead of us.  \n \nThe President\u2019s  FY 2022 Budget details a  robust set of discretionary proposals to help deliver that  \nfuture by reinvesting in the foundations of our  Nation\u2019s strength.  The  Administration strongly  \nsupports the House Appropriations Committee in putting forth FY 2022 bills that reflect these  \nshared priorities.  \n  \nThe Administration would like to take this opportunity to share  additional views regarding the \nHouse Appropriations Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  \n \nDepartment of State and  Other  International Programs  \n \nInternational Climate Change.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for U.S. \ninternational climate funding to reestablish the United States as a  global leader in climate finance  \nand catalyze climate  action worldwide.  The bill provides over $3 billion for global  climate and   environmental programs, including $1.9 billion for U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund \nand other multilateral climate initiatives.  \n \nCentral America.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides $861 million for  \nCentral America, as requested in the FY 2022 Budget, a strong show of support for the first  year  \nof the President\u2019s commitment to provide $4 billion to Central America over four  years.  \nHowever, the Administration is concerned that the bill limits flexibility and  includes a cap on the \n$861 million level and includes 75-percent withholding of assistance benefitting the central \ngovernments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras from all Title 3 and 4 accounts.  The  \nAdministration is also concerned that the bill continues the prohibition on providing  Foreign \nMilitary Financing (FMF) to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.   \n \nGlobal Health Security  and Other Critical Global  Health Programs.  The  Administration strongly  \nsupports the Committee\u2019s inclusion of $1 billion for global health security  programs.  This  \nfunding would enable the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) to invest in high-\nimpact global health security programs, including to expand Global Health Security  Agenda  \ncapacity-building programs to additional countries, support organizations leading the  global  \nCOVID-19 pandemic response through the Act-Accelerator platform, and to replenish the  \nEmergency Reserve  Fund.  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of language in the bill  \npermitting contributions to an international financing mechanism for pandemic preparedness, \nwhich is an Administration priority; a financing  mechanism is critical to catalyze sustainable  \nfinancing for  global preparedness  efforts.   The Administration also appreciates the increases  \nprovided in the bill  for Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning  and Reproductive Health.   \n \nDemocracy Programs.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of $2.5 billion \nfor the Department of State and USAID democracy  programming, in addition to $300 million for  \nthe National Endowment for Democracy.   The Administration looks forward to working with the  \nCongress to ensure adequate funding for  Democracy programs which  would allow the United \nStates to play a larger  role in strengthening democratic institutions, fighting corruption, defending  \nagainst authoritarianism, and advancing human rights.  \n \nGender.  The  Administration appreciates that the Committee provides $200 million for the  \nGender Equity and Equality Action Fund, consistent with the FY 2022 Budget request.  In \naddition, the Administration appreciates the strong support for the Women, Peace, and Security  \nAct as well as the multiyear strategy to prevent and respond to gender-based violence in both \nconflict and non-conflict settings.   \n \nInformation Technology Funding.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill funds the  \nDepartment of State\u2019s Capital  Investment  Fund (CIF)  at $275 million, $174 million or 40 percent  \nbelow the FY 2022 Budget request.   The FY  2022 Budget requested a substantial increase for CIF  \nto  address the national security threat posed by increasing cyberattacks.   Notably, the bill fails to  \ninclude  $101  million to safeguard the Department\u2019s cybersecurity infrastructure in direct response  \nto the SolarWinds incident.   While  the bill authorizes up to $150 million in transfer  authority  from  \nthe Diplomatic Programs (DP) account to the CIF  account, no additional funds were provided in \nthe DP account that would allow for the effective  use of this authority.   \n \n2  \n  Unmet Commitments to International Financial Institutions.   The Administration appreciates that \nthe bill provides a total of $62 million for unmet commitments to the African Development  Fund, \nthe Asian Development Fund, and the Global Environment Facility.  The  bill provides no funding, \nhowever, for unmet commitments to the  International Development Association (IDA).  This  \nfunding would provide needed resources so that  IDA can continue to provide high levels of  \nfinancing to help the world\u2019s poorest countries respond to and recover from the impacts of the  \nCOVID-19  pandemic.     \n \nDebt Restructuring.  The Administration strongly  supports the Committee\u2019s inclusion of  \n$67  million for debt restructuring, consistent with the FY 2022 Budget request.  Specifically, the  \nAdministration appreciates the support for the  Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI)  and the  \nCommon Framework for Debt Treatments Beyond the DSSI.  This would provide the authority  \nand funding for official bilateral debt service suspension to low-income countries, allowing them \nto focus on responding to immediate health, economic, and social spending  needs related to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, and for deeper debt treatments for eligible  countries  as needed under the  \nCommon Framework.  \n \nMiddle East Assistance.   The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for key  \npartners in the Middle East, including  Israel and Jordan, and  economic and security assistance to  \nother key partners.  \n \nWest Bank and Gaza.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for security  \nassistance and increased economic assistance in the West Bank and Gaza and support for re-\nengagement with UNRWA.     \n \nInternational Organizations Contributions.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  \ninclusion of robust funding for assessed and voluntary  contributions to international  \norganizations, which would enable the United States to advance its own interests while leveraging  \ncontributions from other  donors by supporting the  important work of our multilateral partners, \nincluding the United Nations (UN), the World Health Organization, the Montreal Protocol  \nMultilateral Fund, and the UN Population Fund.  However, the Administration looks forward to \nworking  with the Congress on ensuring  robust U.S. leadership with the UN and UN-specialized  \nagencies.   \n \nInternational Peacekeeping Contributions.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  \nsupport for meeting U.S. commitments to international peacekeeping by providing sufficient  \nfunding to pay  U.S. dues on time and in full as well as for providing the requested authority and \nadditional funds to begin paying down accumulated cap-related UN peacekeeping arrears in order  \nto fully fund peacekeeping arrears payments within two years.  \n \nHumanitarian Assistance.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee shares the  \nAdministration\u2019s commitment to supporting vulnerable people  worldwide by  providing the  \nresources requested in the FY 2022 Budget to fulfill the President\u2019s commitment to rebuild the  \nNation\u2019s badly damaged refugee admissions program, support up to 125,000 admissions in 2022, \nand assist vulnerable people abroad, including refugees and conflict victims.  \n \n3  \n  Support for Diplomatic and Consular Operations.  The Administration appreciates the \nCommittee\u2019s support  for diplomatic programs including:  worldwide security protection; embassy  \nsecurity, construction, and maintenance; and consular processing programs.  \n \nUSAID Operating Expenses.   The Administration is concerned that the bill does not fully provide  \nthe level requested in the FY 2022 Budget for  USAID Operating Expenses.   Operating resources  \nat the level requested are  critical to expand USAID\u2019s workforce, support diversity, equity, and \ninclusion initiatives and would allow the Administration to respond more quickly and effectively  \nin development and humanitarian assistance programming and support  expanded global health \nsecurity programs.   \n \nFlexibility on Incorporation of Report Tables  by Reference.   The Administration appreciates that \nsection 7019(b) of the bill restores the Administration\u2019s flexibility to respond to significant, \nexigent, or unforeseen events, or to address other exceptional circumstances directly  related to \nU.S. national security interests.   \n \nEgypt.   The Administration strongly opposes section 7041(a) of the bill, which would reduce the  \nAdministration\u2019s flexibility in regards to FMF to Egypt, undermining its leverage  as it \noperationalizes its commitment to a constructive human rights dialogue  with Egypt.   \n \nProtecting Europe\u2019s Energy Security Act of 2019 (PEESA)  Waiver Authority.   The Administration  \nhas significant concerns regarding an amendment  adopted in Committee that would make  \nunavailable for all of FY  2022 the waiver  authority  under section 7503(f) of PEESA, as amended.  \nThe mandate to impose sanctions\u2014particularly without waiver authority, which the Executive \nBranch always seeks to preserve flexibility  essential for implementing  foreign policy and to  \ncalibrate imposition of sanctions\u2014would scuttle diplomatic efforts, impinge on the President\u2019s  \nauthority to conduct foreign policy, and damage  U.S. relations with European Union member  \nstates.   \n \nConstitutional  Concerns  \n \nCertain provisions of the  draft bill raise  constitutional concerns, including by  interfering with the  \nPresident\u2019s authority to determine the command of the armed  forces, to recognize territorial \nsovereignty, to receive foreign diplomats, and to conduct diplomacy in general.   The \nAdministration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other  concerns.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the  FY 2022 appropriations  \nprocess moves forward.  \n \n* * * * * * *  \n \n4  \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nMarch  1, 2021  \n(House  Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT  OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 1  \u2013  For the People Act  of 2021  \n(Rep.

In  the \nwake of an unprecedented assault on our democracy, a never before  seen effort to ignore, \nundermine, and undo the will of the people, and a  newly  aggressive attack on voting rights taking  \nplace right now all across the country, this landmark legislation is urgently  needed to protect the  \nright to vote and the integrity of our elections,  and to repair and strengthen American democracy.  \nH.R. 1 contains a number of provisions to protect the fundamental right to vote and make it  more  \nequitable and accessible for all  Americans  to exercise that right.   H.R. 1 would reform \nredistricting to curtail the gerrymandering that distorts our democracy, and would modernize our \nelections and make them more secure.   Consistent with the Administration\u2019s commitment to \nracial equity, the bill would also expand the tools  available to the Justice Department to enforce  \nthe voting rights of all Americans.  \nH.R. 1 would also reform our campaign finance system to  amplify the voices of the public, not \nthe powerful, and  establish stronger ethics rules for all three branches of government.  These  \nprovisions  would  ensure  that government works for the people and  guard against  corruption \nacross the highest levels of government.  \nAs with any bill of this scope and complexity, the Administration looks forward to working  with \nCongress  to refine provisions of H.R. 1 as it  proceeds through the legislative process  to ensure  \nthat the bill achieves lasting reform consistent with Congress\u2019 broad constitutional authority to \nstrengthen our democracy.   \n* * * * * * *  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE  OF THE PRESIDENT  \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND  BUDGET  \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503  \n November 3, 2021 \n (House  Rules)  \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF   DMINISTRATION  OLICY \nH.R. 5376 \u2013 Build Back  Better  Act  \nThe Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5376, the  Build Back  Better Act, \nwhich will make historic  investments in children and families, grow the economy, create  \nmillions of good-paying  American jobs, enable more Americans to join and remain in the  \nworkforce, expand access to health care,  set the United States on course to  meet its climate  goals, \nreduce costs for families, and strengthen the middle class.    \nThe bill is the most significant investment in children and caregiving in generations.  It will cut  \nmost families\u2019 child care  bills by half \u2014 or more  \u2014 and help millions of women who have left  \nthe labor force return to work.  By  expanding preschool to three- and four-year-olds across  \nAmerica, it will deliver  the largest expansion of universal and free education since states and  \ncommunities across the country established public high school 100 years ago.  It will cut taxes  \nfor more than 35 million families  by  extending the  American Rescue Plan\u2019s  Child Tax Credit  \nexpansion.  And the bill  expands access to high-quality home care  for older Americans and \npeople  with disabilities.  The bill includes paid family  and medical leave, a provision that the  \nPresident has long supported and included in his original  Build Back Better Agenda.   \nThe bill is also the largest effort to combat climate change in American history.   The increasing  \nfrequency of devastating  hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, and other natural disasters underscores  \nthe demand to  take action to combat climate change and make our communities and \ninfrastructure more resilient.  Through grants, tax credits, rebates, private-sector incentives, loans  \nand loan guarantees, and Federal purchasing, the  Build Back Better Act will reduce our  carbon \nfootprint, prepare communities for  extreme weather events, incentivize domestic manufacturing  \nto create high-paying jobs, promote energy  efficiency  and clean power sources, and propel the  \nUnited States to be a world leader in critical energy  supply chains.  It will cut annual greenhouse  \ngas pollution by  well over a  gigaton by 2030, setting the United States on a path to meet its  \nclimate goals.   \nThe bill is the most significant expansion of affordable health coverage in a decade.  It will give  \nMedicare the authority to negotiate prescription drug prices, and save Americans up to thousands  \nof dollars per  year on particularly costly  prescription drugs, which one in four Americans  \nstruggle to afford.  It will ensure health care is affordable for  nine  million Americans by  \nextending  the American  Rescue Plan\u2019s  expanded  Premium Tax Credit  for Marketplace coverage, \ndeliver health care  coverage to up to four million uninsured people in states that have locked \nthem out of Medicaid, and increase access to  affordable hearing  coverage by  expanding  \nMedicare.    \nImmigrants are  critical not only to who we  are  as  a nation, but also to our economic strength and \nvitality.   The bill provides work permits for qualifying undocumented individuals who have lived \nin our country for decades.   This bill would provide relief to Dreamers, TPS recipients, \nimmigrant farmworkers, and essential workers, among others.   The bill also includes important \nreforms to our legal immigration system, which will help reduce visa processing backlogs.   \n \nFinally, the bill is  the most significant effort to bring down costs and strengthen the middle class  \nin generations.  It makes  the single largest and most comprehensive investment in  affordable \nhousing in history, expands access to affordable, high-quality education and training beyond high \nschool, and cuts taxes for 17 million low-wage workers by extending the  expanded Earned \nIncome Tax Credit.  This legislation also  advances equity through investments in maternal  \nhealth, community violence interventions, and child nutrition, in addition to better preparing the  \nnation for future pandemics and supply  chain disruptions.  \n \nThe Build Back  Better Act  is fully paid for and will  not  increase the deficit; in fact, it  reduces  the \ndeficit.   It does so  by making sure that large, profitable corporations can\u2019t zero out their tax bills, \nno longer rewarding corporations that shift jobs and profits overseas, requiring  millionaires and  \nbillionaires  to pay their  fair share, and stopping  rich Americans from cheating on their tax bills.   \nUnder this historic agreement, nobody earning less than $400,000 per  year  will pay a penny  \nmore in taxes.   The  bill will reduce costs and  fuel  economic growth that will put more money in  \nthe hands of the vast majority of American  workers while contributing to deficit reduction and \nfiscal responsibility.  \n  \nThe Administration urges Congress  to pass the  Build  Back Better Act.

Schneider, D-IL, and 207 cosponsors) \nDomestic terrorism is a growing and evolving threat.  The Biden Administration released the \nfirst-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism in June 2021 to address this \nchallenge to the Nation\u2019s security and improve our ability to detect and respond to this threat. \nThe Administration supports House passage of H.R. 350, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act \nof 2022.  The Administration supports efforts to counter domestic terrorism and looks forward to \ncontinuing to work with the Congress to authorize programs to counter domestic terrorism in a \nmanner appropriate to the existing statutory regimes and constitutional protections, bolster \nresources to carry out this important work, and enable the legislation to achieve its goal of \nenhancing the current government-wide response to the evolving threat posed by domestic \nterrorism.   \nH.R. 350 would authorize a dedicated domestic terrorism office within the Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS) responsible for identifying and analyzing domestic terrorism activity \nin keeping with existing authorities and would codify in statute the establishment of dedicated \noffices within the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to \ninvestigate and prosecute domestic terrorism. \nDomestic terrorism has posed a growing threat over the past decade.  FBI Director Wray, among \nothers, has warned about this escalating threat, including in congressional testimony.  For \nexample, in 2017, Director Wray characterized domestic terrorism as a \u201cvery serious\u201d issue and \nnoted that the FBI had approximately 1,000 open domestic terrorism investigations, \napproximately the same as the number of FBI\u2019s investigations into U.S.-based individuals \ninspired by foreign terrorist organizations.  In 2018, Director Wray warned that \u201claw \nenforcement, racial minorities, and the U.S. Government will continue to be significant targets \nfor many domestic extremist movements.\u201d  In 2021, Director Wray stated that the domestic \nterrorism threat is \u201cmetastasizing across the country.\u201d  In response to the Biden Administration\u2019s \ndirection to produce a comprehensive assessment of domestic terrorism threats, the Intelligence \nCommunity and law enforcement concluded in March 2021 that domestic violent extremists \n\u201cpose an elevated threat to the Homeland.\u201d     \nIn order to address this threat and after conducting a thorough 100-day review, the \nAdministration released the National Strategy.  The Administration has prioritized addressing all \nforms of terrorism and targeted violence, including hate crimes, and is committed to continuing \nto enhance the ability of departments and agencies across government to do so, including \nthrough focused intelligence reporting, enhanced information sharing, and increased training to \nrelevant law enforcement personnel.   \n \nFederal agencies are executing the goals set forth in the National Strategy and sharing \ncomprehensive data on domestic terrorism with Congress and the public.  For example, DOJ \nearlier this year announced the creation of a new domestic terrorism unit within the \nCounterterrorism Section of the National Security Division.  The unit will focus on addressing \nthe domestic terrorism threat by working closely with other parts of DOJ, as well as interagency \npartners.  The purpose of this new unit is to ensure that domestic terrorism-related matters are \nexpertly handled and effectively coordinated across DOJ components and around the country.  \nThe FBI also has an established Domestic Terrorism Operations Section at FBI Headquarters \nwhose mission is overseeing and providing operational support to FBI domestic terrorism \ninvestigations nationwide.  This entity provides regular training on domestic terrorism matters to \nFederal, State, local, Tribal, and foreign law enforcement agencies through FBI field office \npartnerships, as well as through established entities, such as the Joint Terrorism Task Force and \nthe National Academy.   \n \nLikewise, DHS has enhanced its ability to prevent, detect, and respond to threats related to \ndomestic terrorism.

DHS also prioritized the allocation of resources to assist our partners to \nprevent, protect against, and respond to domestic terrorism-related threats through the new \ndesignation in 2021 of domestic violent extremism as a \u201cNational Priority Area\u201d within DHS\u2019s \nHomeland Security Grant Program, as well as through support for target hardening and physical \nsecurity enhancements of non-profit organizations through DHS\u2019s Nonprofit Security Grant \nProgram. \n \nThis legislation would establish an interagency task force to analyze white-supremacist \ninfiltration in specific Federal agencies.

Ensuring equal pay  is essential to advancing  American values of fairness and \nequity.   Women lose thousands of dollars each year, and hundreds of thousands over a lifetime, \nbecause of the  gender and racial wage  gap.   Women working full-time, year-round in 2019 \nearned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men working full-time, year-round, and these  \ndisparities are  greater for women of color.  Pay inequity  also impacts individuals who face  \nintersecting forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including  \nLGBTQ+ individuals.    \nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of women have dropped out of the labor force, partly  \nreflecting the increased  domestic labor demands on women. Caregiving demands often fall  \ndisproportionately on women, which leads to many  women having to reduce their hours, \nresulting in lower  earnings.   As more and more  American families rely on women's income, the \npay  gap hurts  not only  women, but also the families who depend on them.   The cumulative  \nimpact of wage  gaps adds up to financial insecurity  over the course of a career for women and \ntheir families and for generations who follow.     \nThe Paycheck Fairness Act is commonsense legislation that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act \nand give workers more tools to fight sex-based pay discrimination.   It would also take major  \nsteps toward increasing pay transparency, an essential provision to advance  equality in the  \nworkplace, by  explicitly  protecting  workers from retaliation for simply discussing their  \ncompensation with their colleagues.   The bill would also expand opportunities for workers to \nreceive training on effective negotiation skills.  The bill would also limit an employer\u2019s ability to \nrely on salary history during the hiring process to set pay, or when determining wages for  a  \npromotion.   H.R. 7 would hold employers accountable by  closing judicially  created loopholes for  \nemployer defenses and by  adding  a class action option  under the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.

This bill is based on the plan that the President proposed to the Congress in \nJanuary.  It provides the tools and support critical to meet the moment and tackle  the urgent  \npublic health and economic crises the Nation faces as a result of COVID-19.  \nThe bill provides the funding necessary to support the Administration\u2019s Government-wide  \nstrategy to combat COVID-19. This includes funding to set up community  vaccination sites  \nnationwide, scale up testing and tracing, eliminate  supply shortage problems, invest in high-\nquality treatments, address health disparities, and  ensure workplace health  and safety  \nprotections.  The bill also  extends tax credits for employers that provide workers with paid sick \nand family  leave to contain the spread of the virus.  Because the pandemic has created  \nunprecedented challenges for students and parents, with families of color disproportionately \nimpacted, the bill provides K-12 schools and institutions of higher learning with the resources  \nthey need to reopen  safely  and stay  open, as well as to address the academic, social and \nemotional needs of students. \nThe bill also delivers immediate relief to  workers and families bearing the  brunt of the public  \nhealth and economic crises.

The bill also expands the Child Tax  Credit \nand Earned  Income Tax  Credit on an emergency  basis, extends key emergency unemployment  \nbenefits, raises the minimum wage to $15 per hour, and stabilizes pensions for Americans who \nparticipate in multi-employer pension plans.  To deal with the  acute housing and hunger  crises  \ncaused by the pandemic, the bill provides Americans in need with rental, mortgage, and \nhomelessness assistance and extends the emergency benefit increase in the Supplemental  \nNutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

Instead, some have sought to delegitimize the election  and make it  \nharder to vote, in many  cases by targeting the methods of voting  that made  it possible for many  \nvoters to participate.

Among other things, it would create  a new \nframework for allowing  DOJ to review voting changes in jurisdictions with a history of \ndiscrimination to ensure that they do not discriminate based on race.

Too many  families lack access to affordable, high-\nspeed internet, clean drinking water, and public transportation.  In the United States, the  \ntransportation sector is the largest contributor to greenhouse  gas emissions and is also one of the  \nsectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate  change.  And, too often, past infrastructure  \ninvestments have disproportionately  and negatively  impacted low-income neighborhoods and \ncommunities of color.  It has never been more important for us to invest in strengthening our \ninfrastructure and competitiveness, and do so in a way that creates the  good-paying union jobs of \nthe future, addresses long-standing  racial  and economic  injustice, and helps to fight the climate  \ncrisis.  \nThe historic  Infrastructure  Investment and  Jobs Act would  make an array of transformational \ninvestments in our country\u2019s infrastructure.  It  would  support modernization  and expansion of  \nrail networks across the country and make the largest Federal investment in public transit in \nhistory.  The  legislation would  provide resources to repair and rebuild our  roads and bridges with \na focus on climate  change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for  all users, including  \ncyclists and pedestrians.  It would also make critical investments in ports and airports to \nmodernize facilities and reduce bottlenecks.  In addition, the  Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs \nAct would  begin to eliminate the  Nation\u2019s lead service lines and pipes, delivering  clean drinking  \nwater to up to ten million American families and more than 400,000 schools and child care  \nfacilities that currently do  not  have it, including in Tribal nations and disadvantaged \ncommunities.  And, recognizing that broadband access and digital inclusion  are  critical for    \nAmericans to fully  participate in modern society, the  Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act \nwould  help connect every  American to reliable high-speed internet, building on the billions of \ndollars for broadband deployment in the American Rescue Plan  Act of 2021.  It would  also help \nlower prices for internet service  and help close the digital divide, so that more Americans can \nafford internet access.  \n \nThe  Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act is also  a critical down payment to help address the  \nclimate emergency.  It would  support the development of  a network of electric vehicle  chargers \nalong highways and in rural and disadvantaged communities and electrify thousands of school \nand transit buses across the country.  In addition, the  legislation would  provide investments to \nupgrade our power infrastructure, including by building thousands of miles of new, resilient \ntransmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy.  It  would  also make the largest \ninvestment in addressing  legacy pollution in American history.   \n \nFinally, the legislation would  make our infrastructure more resilient against the impacts of  \nclimate change, cyber-attacks, and extreme weather events,  including by making  critical \nresources available to state, local, tribal, and territorial communities  to prevent, prepare for, \nrespond to, and recover from natural disasters and  cybersecurity incidents.  \n \nThe Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this legislation, which \nrepresents a major step in achieving the President\u2019s Build Back  Better agenda.  \n \n* * * * * * *   \n  ", "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT \nOFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET \nWASHINGTON, D.C.  20503 \nApril 27, 2022 \n(Senate) \nS A P\nTATEMENT OF  DMINISTRATION  OLICY\nS.J.
