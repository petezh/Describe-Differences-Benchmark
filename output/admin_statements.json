Passage of this bill will provide much-needed relief to families and businesses who are struggling in the current economic downturn.    As the Nation\u2019s economy recovers from the economic crisis, this legislation includes several provisions that will encourage companies to invest in new technologies and hire more workers.  H.R. 4213 will extend the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit for another year, encouraging businesses to increase investments in technology and create more high-tech jobs for the twenty-first century.  The legislation also extends the tax credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel, providing clean energy companies with the certainty they need to make critical investments in the Nation\u2019s energy future.  The Administration is also pleased with the extension of the new markets tax credit.  Since its establishment in 2000, this credit has stimulated private investment in economically depressed communities, helping to build schools and health care facilities as well as providing entrepreneurs with the resources to succeed.   Finally, the Administration commends the House for paying for this job-creating legislation in a fiscally-responsible manner that is consistent with other legislative priorities including health care.  The legislation would fulfill the Administration\u2019s commitment to crack down on overseas tax havens and put a stop to billions of dollars worth of tax abuse and would end the special preferential tax treatment for carried interest income.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3992, which would address the immigration status of certain individuals who came to the United States as children, know this Nation as their home, and, by their actions, are contributing to the prosperity and security of the United States.  The DREAM Act would provide conditional nonimmigrant status to individuals who:  (1) came to the United States before turning 16 years old; (2) have lived continuously in the United States for at least five years prior to the date of enactment; (3) were under the age of 30 on the date of enactment; (4) demonstrate good moral character; (5) are not inadmissible or deportable under a number of key grounds; and (6) have graduated from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or have been admitted to an institution of higher education in the United States.    Before these individuals could apply for permanent resident status in the United States, they would have to meet additional requirements \u2013 in particular, completion of at least two years of either college or military service.  The young people who would be eligible for relief under the DREAM Act are prime examples of the need for comprehensive immigration reform that is based on requiring accountability and responsibility from all \u2013 the government, employers, and those who have entered the country illegally.  The present system is broken and the Administration continues to call on the Congress to pass comprehensive reform.  While the broader immigration debate continues, the Administration urges the Senate to take this important step and pass the DREAM Act.  Young people who have spent much of their lives in the United States and want to improve their lives and their Nation by pursuing higher education or defending the United States as members of the Armed Forces should be given this opportunity to earn legal status.       ", "The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S.J. Res. 26, which would undermine the Clean Air Act and hinder EPA\u2019s ability to comply with a Supreme Court ruling on greenhouse gasses (GHGs).  The Administration believes that comprehensive energy and climate legislation is the most effective way to transition to a clean energy economy that will create jobs, protect the environment, and increase national security.  S.J. Res. 26 would do just the opposite; it would increase the Nation\u2019s dependence on oil and other fossil fuels and block efforts to cut pollution that threatens our health and well-being.   Specifically, passage of S.J. Res. 26 would block implementation of an historic, multi-agency Federal program set in motion by the Administration to promote fuel economy standards that will reduce oil consumption, save American consumers more than $3,000 in fuel costs over the lifetime of a model year 2016 vehicle, and limit pollution from tailpipe emissions.  S.J. Res. 26 also would undermine the Administration\u2019s efforts to reduce the negative impacts of pollution and the risks associated with environmental catastrophes, like the ongoing BP oil spill.  As seen in the Gulf of Mexico, environmental disasters harm families, destroy jobs, and pollute the Nation\u2019s air, land and water.  Further, S.J. Res. 26 is contrary to the widely-accepted scientific consensus that GHGs are at increasingly dangerous concentrations and are contributing to the threat of climate change.  S.J. Res. 26 would strip EPA of its authority to protect the public from GHG pollution, and thus prevent it from following its statutory obligations as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  Finally, S.J. Res. 26 would undo EPA\u2019s carefully constructed approach to reducing pollution generated by the largest oil companies, oil refineries, and other large-scale polluters.  EPA\u2019s reasoned approach will provide industry certainty, which is essential to jumpstarting private -sector investments and innovation in clean, renewable energy.  S.J. Res. 26 would block the United States from taking action to control environmentally damaging GHGs while other nations take the lead in transitioning to clean energy economies that create the jobs of the future.  If the President is presented with this Resolution of Disapproval, which would seriously disrupt EPA\u2019s ability to address the threat of GHG pollution, as well as the multi-agency Federal GHG and fuel economy program, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the Resolution.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of H.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010.  The Administration has the deepest respect and gratitude for this Nation\u2019s 9/11 heroes.  The President is committed to ensuring that rescue and recovery workers, residents, students, and others suffering from health consequences related to the World Trade Center disaster have access to the monitoring and treatment they need.  The President looks forward to signing a 9/11 health bill into law to help those whose health and livelihoods were devastated by the events of September 11, 2001.   The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to meet the needs of our 9/11 heroes and to strengthen the World Trade Center Health program.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of the proposed substitute amendment 3336 to  H.R. 4213.  Passage of this bill will provide much-needed relief to families and to hard-pressed States while encouraging continued job creation by America\u2019s businesses.  The importance of longer-term extensions for various authorities and programs \u2013 and the certainty that such extensions bring \u2013 has been highlighted by the severe problems caused by interruptions in authorities for these programs.  H.R. 4213 includes several important provisions, including:  (1) an extension of extended unemployment insurance and COBRA subsidies through the end of the year, including reforms to improve COBRA subsidies; (2) prevention of dramatic cuts in reimbursements for doctors in Medicare along with extensions of other important health provisions; (3) an extension of increased American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Federal Medical Assistance Percentage rates that allow for enhanced Federal support for State Medicaid programs; (4) an extension of subsidies so that the Small Business Administration can continue certain lending programs with reduced fees and higher guarantees through the end of the fiscal year; and (5) targeted pension-funding relief.  The bill also includes several other important measures supported by the Administration.  The extensions to expiring tax cuts include several provisions that will encourage companies to invest in new technologies and create more high-tech jobs for the 21st century, including extending the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit for another year.  The legislation also extends the tax credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel, providing clean energy companies with the certainty they need to make critical investments in the Nation\u2019s energy future.  The Administration also supports the inclusion of other important extensions, either in this bill or in future legislation. These provisions include:  (1) an extension and expansion of the TANF Emergency Fund; (2) an extension of bonus depreciation; (3) an extension of Economic Recovery Payments; and (4) the expansion of oversubscribed ARRA programs, including the 48C tax credit for manufacturing and TIGER grants for transportation.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on these and additional measures to spur private sector job creation.    *  *  *  *  *  *  *   ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3985, the Emergency Senior Citizens Relief Act of 2010.  This bill would ensure that seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities receive a one-time $250 payment in 2011 and would support individuals struggling in the face of the economic downturn.  Over 2009 and 2010, most of these individuals also benefited from a similar one-time payment.  Passage of this legislation would help approximately 58 million of those Americans hit hardest by the recession.   * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 4173.  The President has called on the Congress to enact far-reaching financial reform legislation to overhaul the Nation\u2019s financial system in the wake of the financial collapse last year, setting forth clear objectives and principles that were endorsed by Congressional leaders.  Financial reform is critical:  to put in place rules that will allow the Nation\u2019s markets to promote innovation while discouraging abuse; to create a framework in which markets can function freely and fairly, without the fragility in which normal business cycles bring the risk of financial collapse; and to provide a system that works for businesses and consumers.  The Administration commends the House Financial Services Committee for its extraordinary efforts in developing comprehensive financial reform legislation, and also supports provisions intended to promote diversity.  House passage will move the Nation another important step towards necessary, comprehensive financial reform that will create clear rules, consistent and systematic enforcement of those rules, and thus a more stable financial system with better protection for consumers and investors.   As with any legislation of this scale and complexity, the Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress, as financial reform moves through the legislative process, to continue to strengthen key provisions and to achieve successful comprehensive reform.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3082, making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.  \u00a0For the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), this legislation answers the President\u2019s call to expand the care and benefits that the Nation provides to our Veterans.  The President has put forward a plan to increase funding for the VA by $25 billion over the next five years, honoring Veterans\u2019 service by providing more generous funding for their health care.  The President also would create Centers of Excellence for VA medical care, with specialty services in areas like prosthetics, vision, spinal cord injury, aging, and women\u2019s health.  Importantly, the President believes that the VA must be better prepared to care for the Veterans of current conflicts with special focus on mental health screening and treatment for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.  The VA will provide better outreach in rural areas with new Vet Centers and mobile health clinics.  The legislation, as considered by the Committee, rises to the President\u2019s challenge.  It invests critical new dollars in programs that will significantly improve the quality of care and services for our Nation\u2019s Veterans.  Millions of patients, including more than 419,000 Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, will receive medical treatment as a result of these investments.  The legislation takes important steps forward to support the Administration\u2019s efforts to transform the VA into an agile, adaptive organization that is responsive to the changing needs of the Veteran community.    The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  Military Construction  The Administration appreciates the overall level of funding provided for military construction projects.  However, the Administration is concerned that this bill funds several of these projects incrementally, including a critical National Security Agency data center.  Consistent with the President\u2019s Budget, the Administration encourages full funding of these programs to make the most efficient use of taxpayer resources.   Department of Veterans Affairs  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for VA and for providing advance appropriations for VA\u2019s Medical Care accounts so that Veterans will always be provided, without interruption, timely, accessible, and high-quality medical care they deserve.  * * * * * * *     2  ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5136, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011.  The Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee's continued support of our national defense, including, among other things, its support for the Department's topline budget requests for both the base budget and for overseas contingency operations.   The Administration welcomes the Committee's support for authorities that assist the ability of the warfighter to operate in unconventional and irregular warfare, authorities that are important to field commanders, such as the Commanders' Emergency Response Program and the authority to reimburse coalition partners.  The Administration also welcomes the Committee\u2019s support to implement recommendations to prevent and prosecute sexual assaults.    While there are many areas of agreement with the Committee\u2019s bill as reported, the Administration has serious concerns with the enormous burden placed on the Department of Defense, including potentially limiting its ability to effectively advance its priorities and streamline operations.  Additionally, the Administration has serious concerns with a number of provisions that would constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions or that depart from the decisions reflected in the President's Fiscal Year 2011 Budget, which carefully balanced fiscal constraints, program performance, strategic needs and capabilities.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns, some of which are outlined in more detail below, and others which may be identified in the classified annex once it is made available.  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Extra Engine:  The Administration strongly objects to the  addition of $485 million for the extra engine program and to associated legislative provisions that limit the obligation of overall JSF development funding to 75 percent of the amount authorized until the funds for FY 2011 have been obligated for the extra engine program, require the Secretary to ensure that each budget in the Future Years Defense Plan include, and expend, sufficient funding to continue the program, and designate the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs as major subprograms.  As Secretary Gates has noted, even after factoring in Congress\u2019 additional funding, the extra engine would still require a further investment of $2.4 billion before it could be considered as a viable extra engine for the JSF program.  The Department does not believe that this cost will ever be recovered in a hypothesized competition or that the funds should be diverted from important defense needs.  The current engine is performing well with more than 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours.  If the final bill presented to the President includes funding or a legislative direction to continue an extra engine program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto.   F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program:  The Administration strongly objects to provisions of the bill which could limit the procurement of the 42 aircraft requested in the President\u2019s FY 2011 Budget.  The onerous restrictions impose unacceptable schedule and budget risks on the JSF program.  While the Department believes the restructured development schedule is achievable, failure to achieve any one of the criteria would affect the procurement decision with significant impact on unit cost, production ramp, and TACAIR force structure.  The Department's F-35 procurement request is in line with independent manufacturing studies, risk review recommendations, and the FY11 request reflects an optimized production.  If the final bill presented to the President contains provisions that would seriously disrupt the F-35 program, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend a veto.   C-17 Aircraft:  The Administration appreciates that the Committee supports the President\u2019s budget request regarding the C-17 program and that it did not authorize procurement of additional C-17 aircraft.    Aircraft Retirements:  The Administration objects to provisions that restrict aircraft retirements. The Air Force uses the Total Force to project forces and meet airlift demand.  The Department manages its fleet as a sum of the parts and not as individual components.  Retirements accompanied by modifications and other enablers provide a smaller, but more flexible, lethal, and capable force.  The restriction impairs the Department's ability to effectively manage its fleet as good stewards of the taxpayer\u2019s dollar.  Multiyear Procurement of FA-18E/F and EA-18G Aircraft:  The Administration objects to Section 122, which directs the reinvestment of future year savings realized from the execution of this multiyear procurement contract back into the procurement of additional F/A-18E or F/A18F aircraft.  The Administration must retain the authority to apply these funds consistent with Departmental priorities and the demands of national defense.    Decommissioning of Naval Vessels:  The Administration strongly opposes the requirement to retain two ships \u2013 the USS NASSAU (LHA 4) and the USS PELELIU (LHA 5) \u2013 in service and to the specific limitation of decommissioning no more than 2 ships for every 3 ships commissioned.  The Department is committed to replacing older, less capable ships that have become increasingly expensive to maintain and operate with ships better suited for current and future needs that will provide forces the capability to meet a wider range of Combatant Commanders\u2019 requirements.  Additionally, the Administration objects to Section 1022\u2019s burdensome new notification requirements for decommissioning any battle force vessel of the active Fleet.    Unified Medical Command:  The Administration strongly objects to the provision in the bill to authorize the President to create a new military medical command.   The proposed delegation of responsibilities to a unified medical command would render hollow the role of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (ASD(HA)) to serve as the principal Departmental official for health and medical matters.  The imposition of additional organizational structure with the attendant personnel and operational costs it would require could directly conflict with the effort by the Administration to eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic layers, headquarters and defense organizations.   Building Partner Capacity:  The Administration urges the inclusion of its requested proposals, which were developed with close coordination between the Departments of Defense and State, to 2  build the capacity of partner-nation special and conventional forces.  Among other things, these proposals are important for the implementation of U.S. policy in Afghanistan, to enhance and increase coalition participation in Afghanistan in order to reduce the pressure on U.S. forces, and to support the drawdown strategy in Iraq and counter-terrorism programs.  Of particular concern are provisions relating to the use of critical funding for Yemen Ministry of Interior counter-terrorism forces and restrictions on efforts to develop Iraqi Security Forces that can independently provide for internal security by December 2011.  The Administration appreciates Congressional concerns for equal contributions from the Government of Iraq and is working to ensure Iraq\u2019s overall cost share requirement.    Early Infantry Brigade Combat Team (E-IBCT), Increment 1 Equipment:  The Administration objects to language in Section 111 prohibiting the Secretary of Defense from procuring more than two brigade sets of E-IBCT equipment.  The Administration also opposes the removal of $626.7 million in Fiscal Year 2011 E-IBCT procurement funding as this action will delay fielding of E-IBCT capabilities to deploying forces by at least 16 months.  These actions will increase the overall cost to the program and increase the risk of a break in production.  Military Pay Raise: The Administration values the service members of the U.S. Armed Forces and believes that the President\u2019s proposed 1.4 percent pay increase is appropriate in light of other benefits and other forms of compensation, is targeted to avoid hindering the Department\u2019s ability to focus on recruiting or retaining for key skills, and will ensure the availability of financial resources needed to sustain our combat power at a time of war.   Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS):  The Administration objects to the DCIPS provision, which negates the purpose of conducting an independent review of DCIPS as required by the FY 2010 national defense authorization bill.  The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) is expected to deliver its final report to Congress by June 1, 2010; the Secretary of Defense has until August 1, 2010, to report to Congress describing actions he proposes to take in response to the report.  Legislating a continued freeze to DCIPS for another year will preclude the Secretary of Defense from being able to take meaningful action based on the NAPA review.  Missile Defense:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for missile defense programs, especially for the new Phased Adaptive Approach for Missile Defense in Europe.  However, the Department is concerned that the restriction on \u201cpreparation of equipment\u201d in Section 221 could severely undermine the development, adaptation, and testing of equipment that is essential for missile defense cooperation in Europe as well as in other regions.   Guam:  The Administration is committed to addressing the needs on Guam (both on base and off) to allow for the realignment of Marines and their families from Japan.  That effort requires a comprehensive government-wide approach.  The Administration is concerned with the provisions of the bill that suggest Guam infrastructure improvements are an exclusive DOD financial responsibility rather than a shared inter-agency, intergovernmental effort led by DOD.     New Requirements Imposed on Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 Recommendations:  The Administration opposes Section 2711.  The Administration has repeatedly opposed any legislative provision that modifies, delays, repeals, or otherwise impedes implementation of a BRAC recommendation.  These restrictions are unnecessary and set an undesirable precedent on addressing challenging BRAC execution issues.   3   Incremental and Forward Funding:  The Administration is concerned that the bill authorizes incremental funding for certain Navy ships and certain military construction projects.  The Administration also objects to authority for $65 million of long-lead procurement of future AN/TPY-2 radar equipment because the funding is in advance of need and would incrementally fund a capability that should be fully funded in future budgets.  As a matter of fiscal prudence, the Administration encourages full funding of these programs, consistent with the Budget.   *  *  *  *  *  *  *  4  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 2996, with the Senate Committee-reported bill, making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.  The bill makes efficient and effective investments that protect and enhance America\u2019s natural and historical treasures, from our forests to our lakes and our monuments.  It also funds critical activities to protect the health of the American people, the environment in which we live, and the modernized 21st Century infrastructure that is vital to our economy.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding specific provisions in the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  Administration Priorities  Environmental Protection Agency.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of $400 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, but urges the Congress to fully fund the President\u2019s request of $475 million.  The Administration also commends the Committee for fully funding the remaining two Water Security pilot projects.  The lessons learned from these pilot projects will provide water systems nationwide with tools to effectively protect their critical water infrastructure.    Wildland Fires.  The Administration appreciates the support of the Committee in providing requested funding amounts for wildfire suppression operations and amounts equal to the request for the new Wildland Fire Suppression Contingency Reserve of the Department of Agriculture Forest Service and the Department of the Interior.  However, the Administration has significant concerns about merging Contingency Reserves funding into the base fire programs of the agencies.   Indian Health Service.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s initiative to expand health care services through the Indian Health Service, but urges the Congress to remove a provision that restricts the ability of Alaska Natives to decide if they will administer the programs that benefit their communities.   Efficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for proposed reductions, including the termination of grants for local water infrastructure that have achieved their purpose. The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the President\u2019s other  proposals, especially for those items that fund narrowly focused activities or duplicate existing programs that accomplish similar goals.  Department of the Interior  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for climate change funding for the Interior Department but strongly encourages the Congress to fully fund the request, including $40 million to help States plan and implement activities to help wildlife adapt to the impacts of climate change.    The Administration urges the Congress to provide the $30 million increase requested for programs to help teach youth about conservation through outdoor activities, such as hunting and fishing.  The Administration also suggests that the Congress fund Park Partnership project grants as requested, to leverage non-Federal dollars and engage partners in preparation for the 100th anniversary of the National Park System.  The Congress is urged not to include a provision that will allow Federal funding through the Office of Surface Mining to be used as non-Federal cost share funds for other agency programs.  Under this provision, the Federal Government would in effect bear the full cost of projects, in essence waving cost share.  Department of Agriculture (USDA)   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of our national forests but has concerns with the Committee\u2019s decision to transfer funds to the National Forest System account rather than provide funding for the President\u2019s Protecting National Forests Initiative.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the request in order to permit greater flexibility in protecting natural resources and maintaining facilities.    The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of funding for the USDA Forest Service portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but urges the Congress to fully fund the Forest Legacy program component.  The Budget reflects broad support of forest-based economic development and the Administration encourages the Congress to reconsider its approach to the Economic Action Program, which is duplicative of other Federal programs.    * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of Amendment 4575 to H.R. 1586, which would provide much-needed relief to teachers and critical assistance to hard-pressed States.  Since teachers are essential to the quality of education that the Nation affords its children and to America's long-term strength and security, the Administration strongly supports the $10 billion Education Jobs Fund to avert the layoff of hundreds of thousands of public school teachers as students return to school in the coming months.  The Administration strongly supports the extension of the temporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for six months through June 2011, which will provide critical assistance to States to help them maintain their Medicaid programs during a period of high enrollment growth and reduced State revenue.  In addition, to provide this assistance in a fiscally responsible way, the amendment includes revenue-raising provisions similar to those included in the President's Budget, including proposals to close international tax loopholes that currently allow multinational corporations to inappropriately lower their U.S. taxes.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the Reid Amendment to H.R. 2847 as one important step forward in the ongoing effort to help put Americans back to work.  The amendment includes several of the Administration\u2019s top priorities for job creation, including a tax incentive to encourage businesses to hire, a tax cut to make it easier for small businesses to invest and expand, and further measures to keep people at work improving the Nation\u2019s roads, bridges, and public transportation infrastructure.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on additional job creation measures, including increased access to credit for small businesses.    *  *  *  *  *  *  *    ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of the Manager\u2019s Amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 510, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act.  This bipartisan bill addresses longstanding challenges in the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) food safety and defense system by promoting a prevention-oriented approach and providing the Federal Government with many important tools to accomplish its core food safety and food defense goals, including authority to ensure that food producers implement appropriate preventive controls.  The bill would complement efforts that the Administration has already undertaken administratively to improve food safety and address many of the key recommendations of the President's Food Safety Working Group, including support for an approach to food safety that leverages the work of Federal, State, and local regulatory and public health agencies.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to continue to make improvements in our food safety system and to ensure that FDA has sufficient fee resources to achieve our shared food safety and food defense goals.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 3326, with the Senate Committee-reported text, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.  The Administration is committed to keeping the United States military the strongest and most capable military in the world.  The President\u2019s strategy increases training, resources, and support for the U.S. Armed Forces.  To keep the United States secure, the Armed Forces must have sufficient resources to prevail in current operations while maintaining and developing new capabilities to deter potential adversaries and prepare for other risks and contingencies.  This legislation, as approved by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, advances many initiatives in line with the President\u2019s goals.  The President and the Nation\u2019s military leadership have put forward a strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan so that all elements of national power are engaged and integrated in an effort to defeat  al Qaeda and prevent attacks on the homeland as well as on U.S. allies and partners.  In Iraq, the United States is moving forward with a responsible drawdown of combat forces, having transferred security responsibilities to Iraq\u2019s forces.  The legislation, as approved by the Committee, provides critical resources to enable this to happen.  The Administration has recognized the importance of requesting a full year\u2019s resources for these operations.  Providing full-year funding will give troops carrying out operations overseas the ability to plan operations more effectively and will cause far less disruption in base programs.  By providing a full year\u2019s funding up front for these operations, the Committee follows through on the President\u2019s request, and ends the disruptions caused by relying on supplemental funding.  In addition, the Administration urges the Congress to clearly delineate war spending from base funding in both classified and unclassified programs, as presented in the President\u2019s request.    Supporting servicemembers and their families is a top priority for the President and the Department of Defense (DOD).  This includes increasing the size of the Army to reduce the strain on military families, and additional help to put an end to the practice of holding servicemembers past their initial commitment.  It also includes easing the burdens on U.S. troops and their families with increased pay, quality child care, job training for spouses, and expanded counseling and outreach to families that have experienced the separation and stress of war.  The legislation builds on the progress in the Fiscal Year 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act with necessary resources to meet these commitments.   The President has also requested significant new resources for military medical care, with additional Army wounded-warrior complexes and increased resources to address traumatic brain injuries and mental health needs.  The Committee legislation meets the President\u2019s goals with funding that advances first-class medical care for servicemembers and their families.  The Administration believes that, while the Committee has made important investments in the Nation\u2019s defense, there are significant ways in which the current bill can be strengthened and looks forward to working with the Congress on this effort.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  Support for the President\u2019s Priorities.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s initiatives proposed to reshape our military posture and get the most benefit from every Defense budget dollar.  The Administration commends the Committee for its support for the termination of programs that are no longer needed or are not performing as intended.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee does not include unrequested funding for three such programs that could result in a veto \u2013 unrequested advance procurement funding for the F-22 fighter aircraft, the continued development of the Joint Strike Fighter Alternate Engine, and additional funding for the VH-71 Presidential Helicopter Program.  The Congress is urged to oppose funding these programs during floor action and in conference.  C-17 Transport Aircraft.  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $2.5 billion in funding for 10 unrequested C-17 airlift aircraft.  Analyses by DOD have shown that the 205 C-17s in the force and on order, together with the existing fleet of C-5 aircraft, are sufficient to meet the Department\u2019s future airlift needs, even under the most stressing situations.  Operation and Maintenance (O&M).  The Administration strongly opposes the bill\u2019s reductions totaling over $3 billion from O&M accounts (excluding Defense Health Program) \u2013 through direct cuts and cuts mandated in sections 8091 and 8100.  These reductions would hurt force readiness and increase stress on military people and equipment.  Helicopter Training.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s realignment of $142 million in Army O&M funding as part of the Administration\u2019s initiative to add $500 million to increase our military\u2019s helicopter capacity.  This initiative is especially key to sustaining progress in Afghanistan.  Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF).  The Administration opposes the reduction of $900 million for ASFF sustainment.  Accelerating the growth in size and capability of the Afghanistan National Security Forces is a key component of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan.  The President\u2019s full request reflects his commanders\u2019 plan for Afghan forces to assume a greater share of responsibility for security as quickly as possible.  Security and Stabilization Assistance (Section 1207).  The Administration urges that funding is provided as requested for section 1207 reconstruction stabilization assistance.  Alaska Territorial Guard.  The Administration objects to a new General Provision that would count as \u201cactive duty\u201d service the time Alaska Territorial Guard members served during World 2  War II.  This provision would establish a precedent of treating service performed by a State employee as active duty for purposes of the computation of retired pay.   Funding in Advance of Need.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s funding for the President\u2019s $9.3 billion request for missile defense programs.  However, the Administration opposes the addition of $41 million for long-lead procurement of the next TPY-2 radar because the funding is well in advance of need and would incrementally fund a capability that should be fully funded in future budgets.   Classified Programs.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for classified activities, including cyber security.  However, the Administration has significant concerns with some of the Committee\u2019s reductions, particularly to certain compartmented programs, including the \u201cConnect the Centers\u201d cyber security initiative, and the Business Transformation Office.  The details of these concerns will be provided under separate cover.   * * * * * * * 3  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3221, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009.  The Administration is pleased that the bill will make key investments in college affordability and education reform, eliminate wasteful subsidies to financial institutions, and save taxpayers money.  The bill takes critical steps toward achieving the President\u2019s goal of restoring the United States to first in the world in college completion by 2020.  The Administration supports the bill\u2019s reforms that would stabilize student loan programs using proven, private-sector practices.  Federally guaranteed student loans provide banks and other lenders with large profits that are set by the legislative process.  Under H.R. 3221, the use of the Direct Loan program would eliminate this process and serve students with essentially the same terms and conditions, but at much lower cost for taxpayers.  Students and taxpayers would no longer be subjected to uncertainty when there is turmoil in the financial markets.  The Direct Loan program would use lower-cost Federal capital, and the Department of Education would hire nonprofits and private companies, selected through a competitive contracting process, to provide the best services for students at the lowest cost for taxpayers.  For the sake of taxpayers as well as students, entities providing student loan services should be selected based on performance and cost.  The Administration is pleased that H.R. 3221 would use the savings from these reforms to make key investments in providing Americans the skills they need to compete for 21st century jobs.  The Administration strongly supports the bill\u2019s provision of additional funding that would support growth in the Pell Grant program, the cornerstone of the Nation\u2019s efforts to make sure that all Americans can afford college.  The Administration supports the bill\u2019s simplification of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, eliminating unnecessary questions that act as obstacles for aspiring college students.  The Administration is also pleased that the bill would establish a new College Access and Completion Innovation Fund to develop, implement, and evaluate new approaches to improving college success and completion, particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The Administration strongly supports the bill\u2019s inclusion of the President\u2019s American Graduation Initiative to usher in new innovations and reforms for our Nation\u2019s community colleges.   H.R. 3221 would support the President\u2019s call for an additional five million community college graduates, including students who earn or go on to earn degrees, certificates, or industry-recognized credentials, by 2020 by funding innovative strategies for building partnerships with employers and the workforce investment system, reforming developmental education, linking community colleges and high schools, and providing students with personalized academic and counseling services.  The bill also would provide $2.5 billion in grants to leverage private-sector  financing for an estimated total of $10 billion in investments to modernize community college facilities so that they meet employer and student needs.  The bill also would include funding for the development and dissemination of high-quality, freely available online training and courses.  The Administration also strongly supports H.R. 3221\u2019s creation of the President\u2019s proposed Early Learning Challenge Fund.  Empirical studies have shown that investing in high-quality early learning provides several dollars in return for every dollar invested.  Unfortunately, the quality of early learning settings varies greatly and, despite some progress, early learning programs are held to inconsistent standards.  Reforms geared toward strengthening quality and improving educational outcomes across all settings are critically needed.  This program would challenge States to develop model systems of early learning, which incorporate a statewide infrastructure of integrated early learning support and services for children from birth through age five.  In order to compete for an award under this program, States would commit to reforming essential components of their early learning system, including establishing a high standard of quality across programs; increasing participation of disadvantaged children in comprehensive, high-quality early learning programs; focusing new and existing programs on improving child learning and outcomes; and creating program rating, monitoring, and professional development systems so that more children are prepared to succeed in kindergarten.  The bill also includes an expanded and modernized Federal Perkins Loan Program that can help to reduce students\u2019 need for private and other non-Federal loans that often carry high interest rates and lack consumer protections.  The amended Perkins Loan Program would retain a low interest rate while allowing financial aid officers at colleges across the country the flexibility to provide additional assistance to those students who need extra funds to complete their education.    As this bill continues through the legislative process, the Administration would welcome improvements.  In addition to the critical support for Pell Grants already in the bill, the Administration would support further measures to strengthen the Pell Grant program.  Loan servicing provisions should be refined to minimize unnecessary costs.  The Administration asks the Congress to strengthen accountability and transparency for institutions voluntarily choosing to participate in the College Access and Completion Innovation Fund, and to increase the share of the Fund set aside for evaluation.  Finally, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the full $10 billion requested for the Early Learning Challenge Fund, and $12 billion for the American Graduation Initiative for community colleges.  The Administration commends the Congress for its commitment to making education a national priority.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to strengthen this vital legislation.  * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1256, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which would provide the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with new regulatory authority over the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products.  Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States and is a contributing factor to scores of diseases and conditions inflicting misery upon millions of our citizens.  Further, tobacco use is a major factor driving the increasing costs of health care in the U.S. and accounts for over a hundred billion dollars annually in financial costs to the economy.     Under the bill, the FDA would be responsible for setting standards for the manufacture of tobacco products as well as regulating the identity and amount of ingredients used in tobacco products.  Further, the bill would increase the protections for adolescents by strengthening the prohibition on advertising and access of tobacco products to young people.  These provisions and many others in this bill will together yield major benefits to the public health.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to further refine the legislation on any issues of potential concern.     * * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 2892, making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.  As we face difficult economic and fiscal decisions, it is important to make efficient and effective investments.  The bill, as considered by the Committee, makes important investments in transportation systems, cyber security, security for our borders, and emergency response.  This legislation serves as an important piece of the Nation\u2019s economic recovery.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  E-Verify  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s continued support for E-Verify, a critical component of immigration enforcement, including reauthorization of the program.  Loran-C Termination  The Administration is very concerned with the Committee\u2019s recommendation to continue operation of the Coast Guard\u2019s antiquated radio navigation system, Loran-C, at an annual cost of over $36 million.  The decision to continue operating a program that serves limited Federal interest deprives the Coast Guard of military personnel and resources to address its pressing priorities.  The Nation no longer needs this system because the federally supported civilian Global Positioning System (GPS) has replaced it with superior capabilities.  As a result, Loran-C, including recent limited technological enhancements, serves only a small group of long-time users.  The termination plan for Loran-C system includes the preservation of high value equipment and measures to secure the sites until there is a decision about future use of the property.  The timing of Loran-C termination activities does not adversely impact the process underway at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to evaluate the requirements for a GPS backup capability nor does it weaken any evaluation of eLoran, the latest in the long-standing series of loran systems designed to expand the utility of existing Loran-C by expanding coverage to the interior of the United States and upgrading the accuracy of the timing capability. Further, the Administration is concerned that the Committee\u2019s direction to the Coast Guard to provide a plan within 30 days for construction of an eLoran system bypasses DHS\u2019 acquisition process by foreclosing the analysis of alternatives.   Disaster Relief Fund  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funds the Disaster Relief Fund.  Federal Protection Service (FPS)  The Administration is concerned that the Committee does not recommend the transfer of FPS from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the National Protection Programs Directorate, as requested.  The proposed realignment would provide DHS with a unitary component that would both establish building security policy and ensure compliance.  The Administration understands that an actionable plan is necessary for such a significant transfer.  DHS has been assembling a detailed transition plan to support this transfer and will provide the Congress with these materials when they are finalized.  FEMA Pre-Disaster Mitigation Funds and Emergency Operations Center Grant Program  The Administration appreciates the funding provided for the National Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund.  However, the Administration believes that DHS needs the flexibility to use risk assessment to guide its resource allocation.  Because these programs are intended to improve preparedness and response capabilities in our most vulnerable areas, it is critical that funding be allocated through a risk-management framework.  Cyber Security  The Administration is concerned about the level of funding for the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD).  Funding requested for Cyber Security Coordination is necessary to provide NCSD with more advanced information sharing and collaboration tools to assist the Federal civilian agencies with protecting their networks.  Additionally, the bill contains several provisions that undermine risk-based funding determinations necessary to achieve the Administration\u2019s recently announced cyber security goals and priorities.  * * * * * * *    2  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5072, the FHA Reform Act of 2010.  The Administration believes these reforms are sound policy.  They will reduce the risk to the FHA fund, facilitate the return of private capital to the mortgage market, help to replenish the FHA\u2019s capital reserves, and maintain the long-term health of the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance fund while protecting the interests of low-income home buyers.  These issues are important to FHA\u2019s ability to facilitate our recovery while protecting the taxpayer.  The Administration urges House passage of the Act to strengthen FHA, which should retain the ability to respond to market conditions.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 3082, with the Committee-reported text of S. 1407, making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.   For the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), this legislation answers the President\u2019s call to expand the care and benefits that the Nation provides to our veterans.  The President has put forward a plan to increase funding for the VA by $25 billion over the next five years, honoring veterans\u2019 service by providing more generous funding for their health care.  The President also would create Centers of Excellence for VA medical care, with specialty services in areas like prosthetics, vision, spinal cord injury, aging, and women\u2019s health.  Importantly, the President believes that the VA must be better prepared to care for the veterans of current conflicts with special focus on mental health screening and treatment for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.  The VA will provide better outreach in rural areas with new Vet Centers and mobile health clinics.   The legislation, as considered by the Committee, rises to the President\u2019s challenge.  It invests critical new dollars in programs that will significantly improve the quality of care and services for our Nation\u2019s veterans.  Millions of patients, including more than 419,000 veterans of the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, will receive medical treatment as a result of these investments.  The legislation takes important steps forward to support the Administration\u2019s efforts to transform the VA into an agile, adaptive organization that is responsive to the changing needs of the veterans community.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  Military Construction  The Administration appreciates the overall level of funding provided for military construction projects.  However, the Administration is concerned that the bill funds several of these projects incrementally, including a critical National Security Agency facility.  Consistent with the President\u2019s Budget, the Administration encourages full funding of these programs to make the most efficient use of taxpayer resources.    Guam Relocation  The Administration is concerned with the $211 million reduction in military construction funding related to the Marines realignment from Japan to Guam.  This level of reduction will adversely impact the agreement reached between the United States and Japan in February 2009.    Department of Veterans Affairs  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support to VA and for providing advance appropriations for VA\u2019s Medical Care accounts so that veterans will always be provided, without interruption, the timely, accessible, and high-quality medical care they deserve.  Constitutional Concerns  Section 113 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch, without discretion, to notify the Congress 30 days in advance of certain military exercises, in which case it would intrude on the President\u2019s discharge of his constitutional authorities and duties to protect national security.  As a means of avoiding any constitutional difficulty, the Administration recommends revising section 113 to make explicit that 30 days advance notice to the Congress is required where feasible and consistent with the President\u2019s constitutional responsibilities to protect national security.  * * * * * * *      2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S.J. Res. 39, which would undermine important protections offered to Americans and businesses under the Affordable Care Act.  This resolution is an attempt to put insurance companies back in charge of Americans' health care by allowing them to dramatically reduce benefits and increase costs while evading the new protections that the Affordable Care Act provides to consumers.  By  dismantling the Interim Final Rule that set out the conditions under which health plans can qualify for \"grandfather\" status, the resolution would limit individuals' and businesses' choice to keep the plan they had in place when the Affordable Care Act was enacted.  Adoption of the joint resolution would result in significant uncertainty as to what kind of changes may be made to coverage without a loss of grandfather status.  If S.J. Res. 39 were approved, it could be argued that any change in coverage could be made while retaining grandfather status, creating confusion about which plans are actually grandfathered and stripping consumers of additional benefits and protections.     The Interim Final Rule provides guidance that is essential for businesses, individuals, and issuers to determine when health coverage has changed to the point that it can no longer be regarded as the grandfathered plan in effect on the date of enactment.  In specifying what changes can be made without the loss of grandfather status, the Interim Final Rule strikes a careful balance between the goals of the Affordable Care Act of providing new patient protections while minimizing disruption in existing markets.  It achieves these goals by allowing businesses and health insurance issuers flexibility to make the kinds of normal adjustments they have historically made to contain costs and innovate.  The Interim Final Rule ensures that if individuals or businesses choose to change their health coverage so significantly that it is no longer the coverage in place on March 23, the plan will need to provide additional consumer protections required by the Affordable Care Act, such as preventive health benefits without out-of-pocket costs and the right to independent appeals of health plan coverage determinations and claims.  Moreover, the regulators are considering potential specific improvements to and clarifications of the Interim Final Rule in order to be responsive to stakeholders' comments on particular aspects of the rule while continuing to meet issuers', employers' and families' needs for clear guidance.  S.J. Res. 39 would replace the clarity of a reasoned set of rules for maintaining grandfather status with confusion and uncertainty that will be disruptive for both employers and their workers and families and result in unnecessary litigation.  The Administration estimates that 145 million Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance\u2014who make up the vast majority of those with private health insurance today\u2014will be in grandfathered health plans.  Further, the  Administration estimates that 70 percent of small business health plans will be grandfathered in 2011.  To help sustain and promote small business coverage, the Affordable Care Act includes a tax credit for small businesses of up to 35 percent of their premium contributions for employees starting in 2010.   The Affordable Care Act supports Americans' ability to maintain their current health plan if they like it and if an employer continues to offer it without significant changes.  Under the legislation, individuals are guaranteed new benefits and protections if their plan is significantly changed or if they lose their plan or select a new plan.  S.J. Res. 39 would dismantle this balance and would undermine key provisions of the Affordable Care Act that preserve market stability and flexibility and enhance consumer protections for businesses, health plans and individuals.  If the President is presented with a Resolution of Disapproval, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the Resolution.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 1390, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.  The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s continued strong support of our national defense, including its support for the Department\u2019s topline budget requests for both the base budget and for overseas contingency operations.  The Administration appreciates, among other things, the leadership of the Committee in supporting many of the President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have troubled histories or that failed to demonstrate adequate performance when compared to other programs and activities needed to carry out U.S. national security objectives.  In addition, the Administration appreciates that the Committee included some authorities that are important to field and combatant commanders, such as the Commanders\u2019 Emergency Response Program, the Security and Stabilization Assistance program, and the extension of Contingency Construction Authority.    The Administration believes that the Committee has identified many of the key elements that need to be changed in the existing law with respect to military commissions in order to make the commissions an effective and fair system of justice, and looks forward to continuing its close cooperation with the Congress to further refine any issues of potential concern.  While there are many areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration nonetheless has serious concerns with a number of provisions that could constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions, depart from the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2010 Budget, which carefully balanced fiscal constraints, program performance, strategic needs and capabilities, or raise other issues.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns, some of which are outlined below, and to refine this legislation to align it more closely with national defense priorities.  F-22 Procurement:  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions in the bill authorizing $1.75 billion for seven F-22s in FY 2010.  The collective judgment of the Service Chiefs and Secretaries of the military departments determined that a final program of record of 187 F-22s is sufficient to meet operational requirements.  As the President wrote in his letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee on July 13, if the final bill presented to him contains this provision, the President will veto it.    F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program:  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $438.9 million for development of the alternative engine program.  The Administration also objects to provisions of the bill that mandate an alternative engine program for the JSF.  The current engine is performing well with more than 11,000 test hours.  In addition, the risks  associated with a single engine provider are manageable as evidenced by the performance of the F-22 and F/A-18E/F, Air Force and Navy programs supplied by a single engine provider.  Expenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and impede the progress of the overall JSF program.  The Air Force currently has several fleets that operate on a single-engine source.  The Administration also objects to the limit on the obligation of overall JSF development funding to 90 percent of the amount authorized until the Secretary of Defense submits a written certification that sufficient funds have been obligated in FY 2010 for the alternative engine program.  If the final bill presented to the President would seriously disrupt the F-35 program, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend a veto.    Interrogation Duties:  The Administration objects to section 823 in its current form, which would prohibit contractor personnel from interrogating persons detained during or in the aftermath of hostilities under any circumstances.  In some limited cases, a contract interrogator may possess the best combination of skills to obtain critical intelligence and this provision, therefore, could prevent U.S. Forces from conducting lawful interrogations in the most effective manner.  The Administration fully supports the application of ordinary Defense Department rules and regulations to contractors engaged in interrogations (as contemplated in subsection (a)(2) of the current section 823), and could support a revised version of the section that would apply such provisions to contractors who participate in interrogations.  The Administration also would object to any amendment requiring video recording of all intelligence interrogations.  Although the Administration is open to studying a possible video recording requirement, implementing a mandatory requirement at this time would be imprudent, unduly burdensome, and could risk significant unintended consequences in current and future military operations.  Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund:  The Administration objects to the requirement in section 1517(a)(2) for a report to Congress prior to use of the funds.  This reporting and determination requirement (which includes matters that may be beyond the Secretary of Defense\u2019s purview) would delay the release of vital funds for Pakistan\u2019s counterinsurgency efforts.  It also duplicates other reporting requirements in section 1116 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 (Public Law 111-32), which require extensive justification and are due at a later date.    Building Partnership Capacity:  The Administration urges the inclusion of its proposals to build the capacity of partner-nation special and conventional forces in order to enhance and increase coalition participation in Afghanistan and Iraq.  These initiatives will directly reduce the pressure on U.S. forces.  These limited, one-year proposals, developed in close partnership with the Department of State, are necessary for timely implementation of the Administration\u2019s new Afghanistan policy.  Without these authorities, the United States would lose precious time in increasing the capacity and participation of our partners in that conflict and put additional U.S. personnel at risk.    Future Combat Systems:  The Administration objects to the removal of $324 million for Future Combat Systems (FCS) Manned Ground Vehicles and $58 million for Non-Line of Sight Cannon termination costs.  The termination costs for FCS Manned Ground Vehicles cannot be fully paid with FY 2009 funds.  Strategic Airlift Force Levels:  The Administration objects to provisions in the bill that prohibit retirement of strategic airlift aircraft.  The Department assesses aircraft requirement based on capability, not aircraft numbers.  A restriction not tied to an airlift requirement will drive unnecessary costs and reduce the efficiency of the overall fleet.  The restriction impairs the 2  Department\u2019s ability to manage the fleet and respond to combatant commanders\u2019 request for forces.  Joint Tactical Ground Station:  The Administration objects to the deletion of funding for the Joint Tactical Ground Station (JTAGS) program.  JTAGS is essential to the warfighters because it supports simultaneous operations in multiple theaters and provides a direct downlink for in-theater, assured missile warning to global and regional combatant commanders.  Four units are permanently forward-stationed on overseas locations and serve as the primary means for transmitting missile warning to U.S. Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines.  Guam Realignment:  The Administration objects to the $211 million reduction for Navy construction on Guam.  The Government of Japan has demonstrated its commitment to the Realignment Roadmap and Guam International Agreement by appropriating $336 million to transfer to the United States to help fund Guam development in Japan\u2019s current fiscal year.  Failure of the Congress to provide a comparable amount for FY 2010 will place Japan\u2019s $6 billion financial commitment to Guam at high risk.  Furthermore, reductions to the program will increase the U.S. total cost of the realignment.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to provide additional details on program implementation to address concerns identified in the report.  Deputy Under Secretaries of Defense and Assistant Secretaries of Defense:  The Administration has significant concerns with this provision as currently written.  The elimination of non-statutory Deputy Under Secretary of Defense positions in section 901 would be detrimental to the continuity and operation of the Department and severely hamper the Secretary of Defense\u2019s ability to effectively organize, structure, and manage the Department.  National Security Personnel System:  Although the Administration appreciates that S. 1390 provides the Secretary the opportunity to complete the program review and make informed decisions about the future of the program, the Administration objects to section 1101 because legislative action on the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) is premature given the ongoing review by DoD and the Office of Personnel Management.    Constitutional Concerns:  Several provisions of the bill (sections 244, 341 and 1221) are phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch to disclose information about ongoing diplomatic negotiations or certain sensitive national security information, in which case they would intrude on the President\u2019s discharge of his constitutional authorities.     Imagery Satellite:  The Administration has concerns with the Committee\u2019s approach to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2019s imagery satellite acquisition program.    Full Funding:  The Administration is concerned that S. 1390 authorizes incremental funding of military construction projects.  As a matter of fiscal prudence, the Administration encourages full funding of these programs, consistent with the President\u2019s Budget.  * * * * * * * 3  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3534.  H.R. 3534, which is largely consistent with the Administration's vision of dividing the key responsibilities for offshore energy management into three distinct entities within the Department of the Interior, contains the necessary authorities for these three entities.  The Administration believes that it would be most effective if this reorganization focused exclusively on Outer Continental Shelf resources at this time.  H.R. 3534 would provide additional authorities to promote enhanced health and environmental safety standards for offshore operations, strengthen environmental reviews of offshore drilling plans, reform revenue collection, and implement a more extensive system of inspections of offshore energy activities.  These standards will improve safety, and removing the arbitrary limit on liability for damages caused by offshore drilling will create the incentive for the oil and gas industry to comply with new standards and seek out and implement best practices for safety.  The Administration strongly supports the repeal of the limit on economic damages liability for offshore drilling, which has served as an implicit subsidy for the oil and gas industry for two decades.  The Administration likewise supports the repeal of industry subsidies granted in the form of \u201croyalty relief.\u201d The Administration also supports efforts that respect the authority of the Department of the Interior to oversee and regulate offshore drilling, including the need for a temporary suspension of operations necessary to improve safety, well containment methods, and spill response capacity in the Gulf of Mexico.  The Administration has concerns with provisions relating to the Exclusive Economic Zone with respect to U.S. obligations under international trade and investment agreements.  The Administration strongly supports funding for land and water conservation and historic preservation projects that prioritize the needs of the Nation based on competitive processes.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to improve the bill as it proceeds through the legislative process.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3326, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.  The Administration is committed to keeping the United States military the strongest and most capable military in the world.  The President\u2019s strategy increases training, resources, and support for the U.S. Armed Forces.  To keep the United States secure, the Armed Forces must have sufficient resources to prevail in current operations while maintaining and developing new capabilities to deter potential adversaries and prepare for other risks and contingencies.  This legislation, as approved by the House Committee on Appropriations, advances many initiatives in line with the President\u2019s goals.  The President and the Nation\u2019s military leadership have put forward a strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan so that all elements of national power are engaged and integrated in an effort to defeat al Qaeda and prevent attacks on the homeland and on U.S. allies and partners.  In Iraq, the United States is moving forward with a responsible drawdown of combat forces, having transferred security responsibilities to Iraq\u2019s forces.  The legislation, as approved by the Committee, provides critical resources to enable this to happen.  The Administration also recognized the importance of requesting a full year\u2019s resources for these operations.  Providing full-year funding will give troops carrying out operations overseas the ability to plan operations more effectively and will cause far less disruption in other base programs. By providing a full year\u2019s funding up front for these operations, the Committee follows through on the President\u2019s request, and ends the disruptions caused by relying on supplemental funding.    Providing greater support for servicemembers and their families is a top priority for the President and the Department of Defense (DOD).  This includes increasing the size of the Army and Marine Corps to reduce the strain on military families, and additional help to put an end to stop loss.  It also includes easing the burdens on U.S. troops and their families with increased pay, quality child care, job training for spouses, and expanded counseling and outreach to families that have experienced the separation and stress of war.  The legislation builds on the progress in the Fiscal Year 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act with necessary resources to meet these commitments.  The President has also requested significant new resources for military medical care, with additional Army wounded warrior complexes and increased resources to address traumatic brain injuries and mental health needs.  The Committee legislation meets the President\u2019s goals with funding that advances first-class medical care for servicemembers and their families.   The Administration believes that, while the Committee has made important investments in the Nation\u2019s defense, there are significant ways in which the current bill can be strengthened and looks forward to working with the Congress on this effort.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  F-22 Fighter.  The Administration strongly objects to $369 million in unrequested advanced procurement funding provided for 12 F-22 fighter aircraft in FY 2011, rather than ending the production program as requested by the President.  The collective judgment of the Service Chiefs and Secretaries of the military departments has determined that 187 F-22s are sufficient to meet operational requirements.  Consistent with the President\u2019s letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee on July 13, 2009, concerning the National Defense Authorization Act, if the final bill presented to him contains this provision, the President will veto it.    Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) Alternate Engine.  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $130 million to produce, and $430 million to continue the development of, the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) alternate engine, which was proposed for termination by the President.  Expenditures on an alternate engine for the JSF are unnecessary and divert resources from the overall JSF program.  The current engine is performing well, and the risks associated with a single engine provider are manageable.  If the final bill presented to the President would seriously disrupt the F-35 program, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  Presidential Helicopter (VH-71).  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $400 million to make operational five partially-completed VH-71 helicopters.  These helicopters currently have no mission equipment and would require in excess of $2 billion to complete and to operate as Presidential helicopters, yet would still not meet full operational requirements for that mission.  DOD and the White House are conducting a requirements analysis, and the outcome of this effort should not be pre-empted.  If the final bill were to include funds that continue the existing VH-71 program, or would prejudge the plan to re-compete the Presidential helicopter program, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.    C-17 Transport Aircraft.  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $674 million in funding for three unrequested C-17 airlift aircraft.  Analyses by DOD have shown that the 205 C-17s in the force and on order, together with the existing fleet of C-5 aircraft, are sufficient to meet the Department\u2019s future airlift needs, even under the most stressing situations.    Efficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that fund narrowly focused activities, duplicate existing programs, or that have outlived their usefulness, specifically including the Kinetic Energy Interceptor program.  The Congress is encouraged to adopt proposals made by the Administration that would better target scarce resources and redirect funds to programs with greater potential for results.  Tanker Acquisition.  Although the Administration appreciates that the Committee funds the Tanker Replacement Transfer Fund, the Administration strongly opposes language that hinders DOD\u2019s ability to ensure a fair and timely competition and restricts the assembly of all non-developmental 2  aircraft in a manner that is inconsistent with our international agreements.  The Administration supports a procurement approach that takes advantage of the efficiencies associated with an award to a single contractor.   Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles.  The Administration strongly urges full funding for MRAPs and opposes the reduction of $1.9 billion from the request.  Since the President\u2019s FY 2010 request was transmitted, the military\u2019s requirement for MRAPs has increased from 2,080 to 5,244.  The Committee\u2019s reduction would seriously delay fulfillment of this requirement.   Missile Defense Agency Rescissions.  The Administration opposes the rescission of 2009 funds for the European Interceptor Site because this would remove the Administration\u2019s flexibility to arrive at a future decision on ballistic missile defense in Europe.  The Administration also objects to the rescission of 2009 funds for the Space Tracking and Surveillance System, which would result in immediate cessation of work and deobligation of funds.    Security and Stabilization Assistance (Section 1207).  The Administration urges that authority for the section 1207 reconstruction stabilization assistance be funded as requested.  Classified Programs.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address concerns regarding statutory direction to re-organize certain offices within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), reductions to cyber security programs, and cuts to classified activities in ODNI.   * * * * * * * 3  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of health insurance reform legislation.

It makes important changes \u2013 ending the worst practices of insurance companies; giving uninsured individuals and small business owners the same kind of choice of private health insurance that Members of Congress have; and bringing down the cost of health care for families and businesses while also reducing Federal budget deficits.   This legislation provides the necessary health reforms that the Administration seeks \u2013 affordable, quality care within reach for the tens of millions of Americans who do not have it today by providing the largest tax cut for health care in history and prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage to the millions of Americans with pre-existing medical conditions.  It also brings new stability and security for the hundreds of millions who already have insurance by reining in the worst insurance industry abuses and putting in place reforms that increase transparency, improve the quality of care, and contain health care costs.  This legislation contributes to transforming the health care system to make health care more accessible and affordable for the American people.  It also includes provisions that would eliminate wasteful subsidies for student loan lenders and invest these savings to fortify the Pell Grant program and increase Pell Grants for millions of students; strengthen community colleges; strengthen Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority-Serving Institutions; and allow students to cap student loan payments at affordable levels.  The education provisions are estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to reduce the deficit.

The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Military Construction  The Administration appreciates the overall level of funding provided by the Committee for military construction  but is concerned with the use of incremental funding for the following projects: Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, Wiesbaden, Germany; Finegayan Site Prep and Utilities, Guam; and the Air Force Technical Applications Center, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida.  The Administration encourages full funding of these programs to make the most efficient use of taxpayer resources.  Guam Realignment  The Administration is very concerned with the reduction of $273 million for Navy construction on Guam.  To date, the government of Japan has demonstrated its commitment to support Guam realignment efforts by appropriating $336 million for Guam development, and Japan is expected to provide an additional $498 million in the near future.  The U.S. Government\u2019s failure to provide a comparable amount for fiscal year 2011 could place Japan\u2019s financial commitment to Guam at risk.  The Department of Defense (DOD) has worked closely with other Federal agencies to address concerns with the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. Final resolution of these concerns codified in a Record of Decision, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act, will allow DOD to move forward with construction.    Department of Veterans Affairs  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the Department in order to provide the timely and high-quality delivery of health care and benefits that veterans deserve.      Constitutional Concerns    Section 113 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch, without discretion, to notify the Congress 30 days in advance of certain military exercises, which would intrude on the President\u2019s discharge of his constitutional authorities and duties to protect national security.  The Administration recommends revising section 113 to make explicit that 30 days\u2019 advance notice to the Congress is required where feasible and consistent with the President\u2019s constitutional responsibilities to protect national security.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 627 that it understands will be offered on the Senate floor by the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.

The Administration supports Congress\u2019s efforts to codify these changes and provide additional strong and reliable protections for consumers that ban unfair and abusive practices.    The Nation\u2019s credit card system must have more accountability, including more effective oversight and more effective enforcement of credit card issuers who violate the law.  Consumers need to be informed about the consequences of their financial decisions and critical details informing consumer payment decisions need to be written in plain language and be in plain sight on credit card statements.  Credit card companies must be required to make their contract terms freely accessible online in a fashion that allows consumers to easily compare products and choose the card that best meets their needs.  Moreover, every credit card issuer ought to provide consumers with at least one card option that has simple terms and a fully transparent pricing structure presented in language that is easy to understand.

Further, the Administration agrees with the sponsors of H.R. 5013 that the defense acquisition process needs improvement in the areas of acquisition system management, requirements identification and control, financial management, fostering the highest quality acquisition workforce, and promoting and strengthening excellence in the Department of Defense acquisition system and the U.S. industrial base.    The Administration is committed to addressing the issues outlined in this legislation, as well as in P.L. 111-23 (Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act), so that improvements in the acquisition system serve and support the Nation's warfighters and reduce cost growth in defense acquisition programs.  The Administration wants to make certain that the U.S. Government is a good steward of the taxpayers' dollars, which is why it is pleased that the bill includes authorities to make sure that Federal contractors are also responsibly meeting their obligations as taxpayers.

The repeal also will outlaw existing, anti-competitive health insurance practices like price fixing, bid rigging, and market allocation that drive up costs for all Americans.  Health insurance reform should be built on a strong commitment to competition in all health care markets, including health insurance.

The President has called on the Congress to enact far-reaching Wall Street reform legislation to overhaul the Nation\u2019s financial system in the wake of the recent financial crisis, setting forth clear objectives and principles that were endorsed by congressional leaders.  Wall Street reform is critical to put in place rules that will allow the Nation\u2019s markets to promote innovation while discouraging abuse, to create a framework in which markets can function freely and fairly without the fragility in which normal business cycles bring the risk of financial collapse, and to provide a system that works for businesses and consumers.  The Administration commends the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee for its efforts in developing comprehensive Wall Street reform legislation.  The Administration also commends the Senate Agriculture Committee for additional leadership on provisions related to derivatives.  Senate passage of S. 3217 \u2013 including derivatives provisions from the Agriculture and Banking Committees \u2013 will move the Nation another important step towards necessary, comprehensive Wall Street reform that will create clear rules of the road and can be consistently and systematically enforced, thus creating a more stable financial system with better protection for consumers and investors.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve successful comprehensive reform as S. 3217 continues to move through the legislative process.  The Administration will oppose efforts to add loopholes to the bill that undermine consumer and investor protection or that allow institutions to avoid oversight.

The Administration understands that the Senate will consider a substitute for H.R. 1388 that is similar to the text of S. 277, the Serve America Act, sponsored by Senators Kennedy and Hatch.  The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 277, which would move the process one step closer to the President's goal of signing into law legislation that promotes civic participation and service.  The Administration is pleased that under S. 277, the Corporation would develop a plan to set the agency on a responsible path towards 250,000 members within eight years, subject to appropriations.  The Administration is committed to creating high-quality service opportunities that allow Americans to serve their communities and help the Nation meet its most pressing challenges.  The Administration applauds the bill's focus on service learning and provisions that would increase the Eli Segal Education Award and link future increases in award amounts to the maximum Pell Grant awards.  The Administration has called on Americans from all walks of life to take part in civic renewal, and is therefore pleased that S. 277 also would expand and improve service opportunities for seniors.  The Administration would like the bill to include the responsible and balanced introduction of competition into the Senior Corps programs, which would better position the program for expansion.  Competition will improve the quality of service opportunities for seniors while introducing greater accountability and innovation.  As the Federal investment in national service programs increases, the Administration is committed to making the programs more accountable and cost-effective, and supports the many ways in which S. 277 would foster this.  In particular, the Administration supports the bill's provisions to consolidate funding in AmeriCorps, giving the Corporation flexibility to support the best programs.  The Administration is pleased that the bill would expand authority for fixed-amount grants that simplify reporting requirements, ease burdens on grantees, and strengthen accountability for performance.   The Administration is pleased that the bill includes the President's initiative to create \"Social Innovation Funds\" to provide seed money and scale up capital for innovative and evidence-based efforts in the nonprofit sector to address social problems, and for leveraging private and foundation capital to meet major social challenges.

The bill as considered by the Committee makes important investments in innovation and job creation, community safety, and cutting-edge technologies.  This legislation serves as an important piece of the Nation\u2019s economic recovery and is consistent with the President\u2019s commitment to double the funding for basic research over ten years.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  Administration Priorities   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  The Administration is concerned with the reduction of $670 million from the President\u2019s FY 2010 request for Exploration Systems.  This large reduction would likely cause major negative impacts to any options that may emerge from the ongoing blue ribbon review of U.S. human space flight plans.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the NASA Earth science program, which advances the President\u2019s goal of deploying a global climate change research and monitoring system. The Administration is concerned with the elimination of $21 million from the request for NASA innovation, which uses public-private partnerships to advance important technologies and enable access to new sources of innovation through incentive prizes and partnerships. In addition, the Administration is concerned about funding NASA\u2019s R&D activities with primarily one-year rather than two-year appropriations.  Such an action would increase the cost and complexity of budget execution and would diminish flexibility without improving management.  National Science Foundation (NSF).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s goal of doubling the NSF budget as a key component of his Plan for Science Innovation.  However, the Committee\u2019s version of the bill is $108 million below the level requested in the Budget, and this reduction will come at the expense of NSF\u2019s research activities and agency operations.  Department of Commerce  The Administration appreciates the support the Committee provides for the 2010 Census, but  urges the Congress to provide the full request of $7.4 billion in new budget authority for the Census Bureau.  The current bill effectively reduces the President\u2019s request by $206 million by relying upon unobligated balances from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  This would force the Census Bureau to reduce its contingency reserve, a key risk mitigation measure, by nearly one third.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s full funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program and the Technology Innovation Program but urges the Congress to provide full funding of the highest-priority research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as part of the President\u2019s Plan for Science and Innovation.  The bill underfunds requested NIST research and construction activities by $85 million (13 percent); the bill includes $20 million of unrequested funding for construction grants that could be better spent on highest-priority research.    The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of the Economic Development Administration, but urges the Congress to support the Administration\u2019s request within this funding to target $50 million to create a Business Incubator Network and $50 million to develop regional innovation clusters.  Both of these initiatives can help our Nation develop dynamic businesses and assist communities to respond effectively to challenging economic conditions.  The Congress is urged to provide full funding for the Department of Commerce\u2019s share of costs associated with the renovation of the Herbert C. Hoover Building.  The House bill provides only $5 million out of the requested $22.5 million.  While most of the renovation costs will be covered by the General Services Administration through Recovery Act funding, the Department is responsible for key aspects of the project\u2019s costs.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support of the important activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), including providing full funding for NOAA satellites.  However, within this funding the Administration urges the Congress to provide the additional $13 million requested to support accelerated improvement of hurricane track and intensity forecasts, which will help to prevent unnecessary and costly evacuations.    Department of Justice   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the law enforcement, prosecutorial, incarceration and other requirements of the Department of Justice.  However, the Administration is concerned with the prescriptive nature of the additional $25 million provided for the FBI to establish new task forces to combat violent crime.  The Attorney General, as the chief law enforcement officer, should maintain the flexibility to address violent crime, including gang crime, in a manner that best utilizes Federal resources and leverages the unique role of the Federal Government.  Legal Services Corporation (LSC)  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the funding request for LSC and for the elimination of the restriction on the collection of attorney\u2019s fees.  However, the Administration is concerned that all citizens have access to legal representation and urges the Congress to also remove the riders which restrict the use of non-LSC funds by LSC grant recipients and which prevent LSC lawyers from participating in class action law suits that 2  typically seek injunctive relief for the benefit of all members of a class by stopping illegal activity.  In contrast to private lawyers who bring class action lawsuits, legal aid lawyers do not receive payment from clients and therefore do not stand to benefit from large monetary settlements.

Department of Energy  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the request for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The research, development, and demonstration of solar energy and building technologies are two areas where investments can make large contributions toward a clean energy economy.   Office of Nuclear Energy.  The Administration is concerned with the Committee\u2019s reallocation of funds among nuclear energy programs because it reduces the critical investment in longer-term research and development, undermining the goal of building a solid foundation for the long-term use of safe and secure nuclear power. In addition, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to restore funding to re-establish a domestic Pu-238 production capability, which is essential to make sure Pu-238 will be available when needed for planned NASA missions as well as future national security applications.  Energy Information Administration.  The Administration urges the Congress to restore funds to allow the Energy Information Administration to undertake important energy analysis and statistical work, such as gathering critical information on energy use and the performance of Federal energy efficiency programs and to improve the statistical reliability of home energy use data.  Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.  The Administration remains committed to meeting the Federal Government\u2019s obligations for managing and ultimately disposing of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, and is establishing a Blue Ribbon Commission to evaluate options and make recommendations for a new plan for the back end of the fuel cycle.  All of the fees collected in the Nuclear Waste Fund are essential to meet those obligations.  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The Administration is concerned with the $28 million funding reduction to the Pantex Renewable Energy Project. The reduction would result in delays to the first major NNSA renewable energy project in support of the Energy Policy Act goal of acquiring at least 7.5 percent of annual electricity from renewable sources by FY 2013.  Corps of Engineers (Civil Works)   Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of the South Florida ecosystem restoration program, the Congress is urged to restore funding for key initiatives to make progress in restoring this diverse ecosystem and to increase water supply.  In addition, the Congress is urged to remove sections 115 and 116 of the bill, which would obstruct compliance with a court order.  Flood and Storm Damage Reduction.  The Administration urges the Congress to restore the requested $41 million for a base annual level of funding needed to prepare for floods and other 2  natural disasters in lieu of continuing to provide these funds through periodic supplemental appropriations.  The Congress is urged to restore the $2 million requested for the Water Resources Priorities study, a high-priority interagency evaluation of the Nation\u2019s vulnerability to flooding.  Reprogramming Provisions  Sections 101 and 201 of the bill contain restrictions on the reprogramming of funds that present significant management challenges for the Department of the Interior and the Corps of Engineers in the execution of their responsibilities.  The Congress is urged to adopt the President\u2019s proposal with respect to these provisions.   * * * * * * *  3  ", "The Administration strongly supports enactment of S. 386.  Its provisions would provide Federal investigators and prosecutors with significant new criminal and civil tools and resources that would assist in holding accountable those who have committed financial fraud.  Specifically, the legislative enhancements would help the Department of Justice to combat mortgage fraud, securities and commodities fraud, money laundering and related offenses, and to protect taxpayer money that has been expended on recent economic stimulus and rescue packages.  Further, the legislation would amend the False Claims Act (FCA) in several important respects so that the FCA remains a potent and useful weapon against the misuse of taxpayer funds.  In general, this legislation would benefit U.S. taxpayers by both addressing existing fraud and deterring waste, fraud, and abuse of public funds.  Moreover, S. 386 would provide needed resources to strained law enforcement agencies and prosecutors that would enable the Department and its partners to advance the pace and reach of the enforcement response to the current economic crisis.  These additional resources will provide a return on investment through additional fines, penalties, restitution, damages, and forfeitures.  With the tools and resources that S. 386 provides, the Department of Justice and others would be better equipped to address the challenges that face this Nation in difficult economic times and to do their part to help the Nation respond to this challenge.  *  *  *  *  *  *   ", "The Administration recognizes that the availability of hazard insurance is a key element in the ability of individuals and communities to recover from disasters.  However, the Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 1264, which would expand the Federal Government\u2019s role to provide windstorm insurance that is already readily available in the private sector and through State insurance plans without Federal aid.  Although the Administration believes in strengthening the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) for the benefit of policyholders and taxpayers, the central rationale for the program \u2013 the difficulty of obtaining flood insurance through either the private market or State programs \u2013 simply does not apply to windstorm insurance in most markets.  Moreover, because the legislation appropriately requires that a Federal wind insurance program be actuarially sound, the insurance offered through a Federal program may not be any less expensive, and could be more expensive, than what is currently offered by private insurers and/or by States.  As a result, expanding NFIP to cover windstorm insurance would unnecessarily duplicate available insurance products and could \u201ccrowd out\u201d such products where they are offered, while offering little to no savings to the American public. At a time when the NFIP is already facing serious challenges, the Administration cannot support such an expansion.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 2892, with the committee-reported text of S. 1298, making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.  As we face difficult economic and fiscal decisions, it is important to make efficient and effective investments.  The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010, as considered by the Senate Committee, makes important investments in transportation systems, cyber security, innovation and job creation, security for our borders, and emergency response.  This legislation serves as an important piece of the Nation\u2019s economic recovery.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Federal Protection Service (FPS)  The Administration is pleased that the Committee supports the transfer of FPS to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD).  This transfer will properly align the activities of FPS and NPPD, while allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to focus on its key immigration enforcement mission.  The Administration plans to provide additional details to the Congress in support of the FPS transition and realignment of these responsibilities in the next few weeks.  E-Verify Extension  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for E-Verify by fully funding the request and including a three-year reauthorization to continue operations.  This critical program supports immigration enforcement and promotes compliance with immigration laws.  Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA\u2019s) Disaster Relief Fund  The Committee significantly underfunds the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF).  In an effort to implement a more transparent funding process for DRF, the Administration's $2 billion request is based on a methodology that incorporates historical costs associated with FEMA's response for non-catastrophic incidents.   Loran-C Termination  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for termination of the Loran-C radio navigation system.  The Administration supports the Committee's aim to achieve an orderly termination through a phased decommissioning beginning in January 2010, and the requirement that certifications be provided to document that the Loran-C termination will not impair maritime safety or the development of possible GPS backup capabilities or needs.  Immigration Services  The Congress is urged to provide the requested funding to reform immigration fees.  Eliminating the practice of passing on costs for refugees and asylees to other applicants for immigration benefits is an important first step to improve the accuracy, transparency, and fairness of immigration fees.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide additional resources to support and expand successful immigrant integration programs across the country.    * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of Amendment 4567 to H.R. 1586, which would provide much-needed relief to teachers and critical assistance to hard-pressed States.  Since teachers are essential to the quality of education that the Nation affords its children and to America's long-term strength and security, the Administration strongly supports the $10 billion Education Jobs Fund to avert the layoff of hundreds of thousands of public school teachers as students return to school in the coming months.  The Administration strongly supports the extension of the temporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for six months through June 2011, which will provide critical assistance to States to help them maintain their Medicaid programs during a period of high enrollment growth and reduced State revenue.  In addition, to provide this assistance in a fiscally responsible way, the amendment includes revenue-raising provisions similar to those included in the President's Budget, including proposals to close international tax loopholes that currently allow multinational corporations to inappropriately lower their U.S. taxes.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of S. 3307, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.  This bill, which passed the Senate unanimously, would make significant improvements to nutrition programs that serve millions of children across our country each day.  S. 3307 would help reduce hunger during the school day; improve the nutritional quality of school lunches, breakfasts, and all other food sold in schools; and achieve other important reforms to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars.  Passage of this legislation also would help advance the Administration's goal of solving the problem of childhood obesity within a generation, which is at the heart of the First Lady's Let's Move! campaign.

Millions of Americans want employment but cannot find it, and the Administration is committed to supporting these Americans as they look for work and struggle to raise their families and pay their bills.  In addition to assisting struggling families, helping unemployed workers is an effective way to boost the economy and an important part of the Administration\u2019s broader efforts to move swiftly and aggressively to jump start job creation and grow our economy.  At the same time, fiscal responsibility is central to the medium-term recovery of the economy and the creation of jobs.  The Administration therefore supports the fiscally responsible approach to expanding unemployment benefits embodied in the bill.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 2996, making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.

It also funds critical activities to ensure the health of the American people, the environment in which we live, and the modernized 21st Century infrastructure that is vital to our economy.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding specific provisions in the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  Administration Priorities   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The Administration commends the Committee for including the full request of $475 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to restore the ecology and environment of the Great Lakes.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s increased support for the Water Security Initiative, but urges the Congress to fully fund the remaining two pilot projects.  The President\u2019s request would finish funding the cooperative agreements with the cities and allow EPA to transition to data analysis, dissemination of best practices, and close out of the program.  The lessons learned from these pilot projects would provide all water systems nationwide with tools to effectively protect their critical water infrastructure.  Wildland Fires.  The Administration appreciates the strong support of the Committee in providing requested funding amounts for wildfire suppression operations and the new Wildland Fire Suppression Contingency Reserve of the Forest Service and Department of the Interior.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on safe, cost-effective, and accountable results in managing wildfire.  Indian Health Service.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s initiative to expand health care services through the Indian Health Service.  Department of the Interior  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for nearly all of the priorities identified  in the President\u2019s Budget.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the  $30 million increase requested for programs to help teach youth about conservation through outdoor activities, such as hunting and fishing.  The Administration is also concerned about efforts to shift forward coal bonus bid payments that would otherwise be received in future years.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)   The Administration appreciates that the Committee supports the proposed termination of diesel grants, termination of a homeland security grant program for local water infrastructure that has achieved its purpose, and other proposed reductions.  However, the Committee cancels  $142 million in unobligated balances from the State and Tribal Assistance Grants account, which is $132 million more than the request.  The Congress is urged not to exceed the proposed cancellation level.  Some unobligated balances are required to address active lawsuits or appeals; a cut of this magnitude could create liabilities for EPA.  Furthermore, it would harm State environmental programs during a time of fiscal constraint because it would reduce funding that States use to operate their delegated implementation of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and other environmental programs.  In addition, the Administration is concerned about the level of reductions to administrative functions and information technology which provide the backbone for all of EPA\u2019s work to safeguard public health and the environment.    Department of Agriculture (USDA)   The Administration is pleased that the Committee funds the President\u2019s Protecting National Forests Initiative.  However, the Administration does not believe that funds for this initiative should be merged with the existing Legacy Road and Trail Remediation program, for which separate funding was requested.  The Administration urges the Congress to remove the merger of funds in order to permit greater flexibility in protecting natural resources and maintaining facilities.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of funding for the USDA Forest Service portion of the President\u2019s Conserving New Lands Initiative but urges the Congress to fully fund the Forest Legacy program component.  The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for this national performing arts center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy.  However, the Committee\u2019s version of the bill adds  $2.5 million above the requested amount for a program to train arts managers throughout the United States.  This program, like all other educational and performance programs at the Center, is currently funded through private donations.  The Federal role in the Center has for many years been restricted to operation, maintenance, and capital repair of the presidential monument, and appropriating funds for this program would enlarge the Federal role, disrupting what is currently an effective public-private partnership.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 4899, making emergency supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and summer jobs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other purposes.  This legislation is essential to keeping the Nation prepared for domestic disasters by providing recovery assistance across the Nation for situations ranging from earthquakes and hurricanes to terrorist incidents.  It also takes another important step forward in the ongoing effort to help put Americans back to work through the expansion of a youth summer jobs program and offers continued support to America\u2019s small businesses, which are the backbone of the American economy.    The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Federal Emergency Management Agency, Disaster Relief Fund (DRF)  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for $5.1 billion in supplemental funding for DRF.  The additional funding will provide much-needed response and recovery assistance across the country.  The 59 disasters and seven emergencies declared in 2009 involved 33 States or territories, and as of March 22, 2010, another 18 disasters and four emergencies have been declared in 16 different States or territories.  This supplemental funding will also support the ongoing recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast region in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Summer Employment Programs for Youth  The Administration supports the inclusion of $600 million for the Workforce Investment Act youth program for summer employment opportunities for disadvantaged youth. This funding will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and help young people open the door to future opportunities, while enabling them to generate additional income during these difficult economic times.  Small Business Administration (SBA)  The Administration supports the provision providing approximately one month of additional funds to SBA to continue Recovery Act terms that reduce fees and provide higher guarantees on SBA business guaranteed loans.  These steps, along with improvements in the overall lending environment, have helped increase credit for small businesses during the economic recovery.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the extension of these terms for the remainder of fiscal year 2010.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3772, the Paycheck Fairness Act.  The persistent gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s wages demonstrates the need for legislative change.  This bill would address this gap by enhancing enforcement of equal pay laws. Specifically, it would prohibit retaliation against employees who ask about or discuss wage information, and it would provide more effective remedies for women subjected to discriminatory pay practices.  S. 3772 would strengthen the Equal Pay Act by closing judicially created loopholes in the law and bringing its class action rules into conformity with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  S. 3772 also requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect pay data to better enforce laws prohibiting pay discrimination.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1054, Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, which will fund our ongoing military, diplomatic, and intelligence operations, provide emergency funding to strengthen the response to the 2009-H1N1 influenza outbreak, and expand the borrowing authority for the International Monetary Fund (IMF).       We face a security situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan that demands urgent attention.  The Taliban is resurgent and al Qaeda continues to operate from its safe haven along the Afghan-Pakistan border.  The Administration urges the Congress to move expeditiously to approve this funding to help the people of Iraq take responsibility for their own future and work to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress going forward to ensure that these priorities are maintained and that unnecessary items and earmarks are not included in a final conference bill.  Foreign Operations Matters  The Administration appreciates that the Committee supports the President\u2019s international affairs priorities, including those involving Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq.  In addition, the Administration welcomes the Committee's support for Administration efforts to assist the Palestinian people, bolster the Mexican government\u2019s efforts to combat drug trafficking and organized crime, meet humanitarian needs worldwide, and help to address the impact of the global financial crisis on developing countries.  The Administration commends the Committee for expanding the U.S. participation in the IMF New Arrangements to Borrow, and increasing the U.S. quota subscription\u2014crucial measures to protect U.S. economic interests and stabilize the global financial system.

The President requested additional funds and flexibility to enhance our Nation\u2019s capability to respond domestically and internationally.  Given the unpredictability and uncertainty of the  outbreak, it is important to have maximum flexibility to be able to allocate and deploy resources to the most critical activities as the outbreak evolves.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact the appropriate funding and authorities to support the response to the outbreak.    * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 3288, with the Senate Committee-reported bill, making appropriations for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.  The President believes that America\u2019s economic success in the 21st Century depends significantly on a modernized infrastructure, from roads and highways to high-speed rail, inland waterways, and housing.  These infrastructure investments will help build a new foundation for long-term economic growth to benefit the American people for years to come.  The President requested, and the Committee approved, significant new resources for the Nation\u2019s road, rail, and air transportation systems.  The legislation takes an important step toward modernizing what has become an outdated and over-stressed transportation network.  Importantly, the legislation not only invests in new systems, but also works to improve the safety of those systems already in place.  Increased funding for transit and air travel safety will result in fewer accidents and more lives saved.   Additionally, the funding included in the legislation for housing and community development programs can serve as important anchors for locally-driven innovations.  With a strengthened safety net for Americans facing significant hardship in these challenging economic times together with funds dedicated to revitalizing local communities and expanding opportunities, this legislation will help the Nation\u2019s urban and rural areas alike.  As part of this important agenda, the Administration will work with the Congress to secure the funding needed to launch the Housing Trust Fund, which would expand the rental housing supply available for very low-income families.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Administration Priorities   National Infrastructure Bank.  The Administration encourages the Congress to support the creation of a National Infrastructure Bank and not substitute in its place a national infrastructure grant program in conjunction with increases for transportation infrastructure credit.  Once established, a Bank will help forge a new path forward in infrastructure sponsorship and cross-jurisdictional partnership.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as soon as possible to authorize a National Infrastructure Bank, which could blend grant and credit financing.  The Bank will play a key role in supporting regionally and nationally significant, high-value, multi- modal projects selected on the basis of merit.    High-Speed Rail.  The Administration thanks the Committee for its support for capital grants that would help sustain high-speed and intercity passenger rail corridor expansion.  Combat Mortgage Fraud.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Combat Mortgage Fraud initiative, which will support a strong response to abusive practices that have taken advantage of home loan borrowers and contributed to financial market turmoil.  Choice Neighborhoods.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides the requested $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods, which will support the Administration\u2019s broader effort to fight concentrated poverty and revitalize highly distressed neighborhoods.  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s pledge to fully fund CDBG, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to consider reforms to the program, particularly modernizing the outdated funding formula to target funds to economically distressed communities more effectively, resulting in increased accountability.  Efficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their usefulness, fund narrowly focused activities, or duplicate existing programs, including programs not allocated based on cost-benefit analysis.  Department of Transportation  The Administration is pleased that the Committee supports the request for the Department of Transportation.  The Administration appreciates the provision of capital funding for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which will help WMATA to address safety shortfalls within its rail system.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the funding provided to the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Next Generation Air Transportation System.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance, Project-Based Rental Assistance, and Public Housing programs.  This funding is especially important in light of the current economic environment.  The Administration appreciates $75 million provided by the Committee for the Energy Innovation Fund, but urges the Congress to include the full $100 million request to support local initiatives that remove barriers to efficiency and leverage private sector funds.  The Fund will allow for the identification of the most effective practices for replication across the Nation, increasing the dividends of energy efficiency investments in housing.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for HUD\u2019s new Transformation Initiative, which sets aside funds for HUD to become a more innovative and accountable agency.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the full $434 million in transfer 2  authority for HUD programs.

The Administration\u2019s plans for a 21st Century education system begin with demanding effective reform and accountability coupled with the resources needed to carry out that reform.  The bill, as approved by the Committee, provides resources to begin this innovative education revolution.  From doubling funding for research to accelerating the search for a cure for cancer and other diseases, the President\u2019s plan would place renewed focus on the value of science to the Nation, strengthening research that has the potential to revolutionize fields of medicine and lead to path-breaking technologies.  The appropriations legislation approved by the Committee supports the President\u2019s plan.  The Committee bill also would expand Americans\u2019 access to quality health care close to home.  Building on the investments in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Committee bill enhances funding for community health centers, addresses health professional shortages in underserved areas, and boosts public health support at the local and State levels.  This legislation also expands funds for workforce training with an increased focus on new clean-energy industries and promising approaches.  Combined with improved enforcement of workplace safety, working conditions, and benefit security, the bill provides important support for the President\u2019s plans to jumpstart the economy now, while giving American workers expanded opportunities in the years ahead.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.   Administration Priorities  Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s increased support for TIF and strongly urges the Congress to adopt the President\u2019s full request.  National Institutes of Health (NIH) Research.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for NIH-funded research.  The President\u2019s Budget request placed a special emphasis on cancer research that would be funded through the scientific peer-review priority setting process.  By 2010, cancer is expected to surpass heart disease as the number one leading cause of death globally.  Charter School Grants.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for increased Charter School funding and inclusion of a new provision to fund Charter School management organizations and the replication of effective Charter Schools.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the President\u2019s full request for the program and drop the limitation on funding under the new provision.  Corporation for National and Community Service.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to fully fund the President\u2019s request and set the AmeriCorps program on a path to 250,000 members by 2017, as authorized in the bipartisan Serve America Act.  The Administration also urges full support for the Social Innovation Fund, a critical investment in finding, evaluating, and replicating the most effective approaches to challenges facing communities.   Job Training Initiatives.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the critical job training initiatives proposed in the Budget, notably green jobs, transitional jobs, and the Career Pathways Innovation Fund.     Teen Pregnancy Prevention.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee shifts resources into a new, $114 million initiative for proven and promising efforts to prevent teen pregnancy.  Evaluation and Data.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for increases in funding for the Institute for Education Sciences, for evaluation at the Department of Labor and the Corporation for National and Community Service, and for a new workforce data quality initiative at the Department of Labor.  Because rigorous evaluation and accurate data are critical to the effective use of taxpayer dollars, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund its evaluation and data requests.  School Improvement Grants.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee provided only $546 million for School Improvement Grants, $1 billion less than the request.  The Administration places a high priority on implementing effective strategies for turning around the Nation\u2019s lowest-performing schools.  The Congress is urged to provide additional funding for school improvement grants.  The Congress is urged to fund the Administration\u2019s full request for Striving Readers as opposed to creating programs at odds with the need for comprehensive reform.  Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for expanding funding for treatment, screenings, surveillance, public awareness, and research related to ASD at the Department of Health and Human Services.   2  Pandemic Influenza and Advanced Development.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides the requested level for pandemic flu activities.  The Congress has been very supportive of these efforts over the past several years, which have improved substantially the Nation\u2019s preparedness for a pandemic.  The Administration also appreciates support for advanced development activities.   Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Program Integrity.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for strengthening program integrity in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program by including $311 million requested for Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control activities.  This funding will enable CMS to respond more rapidly to program integrity vulnerabilities, identify excessive payments, and establish new processes for improving payment accuracy.  Health Care Workforce.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for increased funding for key initiatives in workforce development.  The President believes that health professions training, including the placement of primary care providers in underserved areas, is critical to improve access and quality of health care services.    Social Security Administration (SSA).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for SSA, fully funding the request and adopting the program integrity proposal to reduce erroneous payments.  This funding will allow SSA to tackle increasing retirement claims, disability claims, and appeals hearings.  Efficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for some of the President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their usefulness, fund narrowly focused activities, or duplicate existing programs, in particular the National Institute for Literacy.

Department of Education  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for several of the President\u2019s education priorities.  However, the Congress is urged to fully fund the Innovation Fund, which supports proven and promising approaches to lifting student achievement, and which was first created under the Recovery Act.  Department of Labor  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the Department of Labor.  While the Administration acknowledges the Committee\u2019s strong support for worker protection, it encourages the Congress to consider full funding the request to rebuild the capacity of these agencies to protect the wages and working conditions of the Nation\u2019s workers, and reduce the amount of the H-1B rescission, which at its current level jeopardizes the Department\u2019s enforcement capacity.  3  Department of Health and Human Services  Expanding Public Health Services.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for a number of important public health activities, including enhancing the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, improving rural health services and children\u2019s mental health services, and increasing the treatment capacity of drug courts.   CMS Research.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the $57 million requested in the President\u2019s Budget to fund research, demonstration, and evaluation for Medicare and Medicaid to find ways to provide higher quality care at lower costs, improve beneficiary education and understanding of benefits, and better align provider payments with costs.  Administration for Children and Families.

The DREAM Act would provide conditional nonimmigrant status for five years to individuals who:  (1) came to the United States before turning 16 years old; (2) have lived continuously in the United States for at least five years prior to the date of enactment; (3) were under the age of 30 on the date of enactment; (4) demonstrate good moral character; (5) are not inadmissible or deportable under a number of key grounds; and (6) have graduated from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or have been admitted to an institution of higher education in the United States.    Before these individuals could apply for a five-year extension to their conditional nonimmigrant status, they would have to meet additional requirements \u2013 in particular, completion of at least two years of either college or military service.  After ten years, these individuals would be eligible to apply for permanent resident status.  The young people who would be eligible for relief under the DREAM Act are prime examples of the need for comprehensive immigration reform that is based on requiring accountability and responsibility from all \u2013 the government, employers, and those who have entered the country illegally.  The present system is broken and the Administration continues to call on the Congress to pass comprehensive reform.  While the broader immigration debate continues, the Administration urges the House to take this important step and pass the DREAM Act.  Young people who have spent much of their lives in the United States and want to improve their lives and their Nation by pursuing higher education or defending the United States as members of the Armed Forces should be given this opportunity to earn legal status.    * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2965, which would repeal the statute underlying \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" after the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certify that implementation of the necessary policies and regulations related to the statutory repeal is consistent with the standards of military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention of the Armed Forces.  Congressional enactment of this legislation would allow a repeal to be implemented under terms and a timetable that would be informed by the advice of our military leadership.  The recently-released comprehensive study by the Department of Defense shows that overwhelming majorities of our Service members are prepared to serve with Americans who are openly gay or lesbian; it concludes that overall, and with thorough preparation, there would be low risk associated with the repeal.

The President is committed to ensuring that rescue and recovery workers, residents, students, and others suffering from health consequences related to the World Trade Center disaster have access to the monitoring and treatment they need.  The President looks forward to signing a 9/11 health bill into law to help those whose health and livelihood were devastated by the terrorist attacks of September 11th.

Statutory PAYGO would hold the Federal Government to a simple but important principle: new tax or entitlement legislation should be paid for.  H.R. 2920 would build on the existing PAYGO congressional rules by strengthening enforcement mechanisms that would require offsetting revenue increases or mandatory spending reductions.  In the 1990s, statutory PAYGO proved successful in encouraging tough choices and helped to move the Federal Government from large deficits to surpluses.    The Administration is committed to cutting the deficit in half by the end of the President\u2019s first term.  Enacting statutory PAYGO would complement this effort and strengthen the budget process.  While PAYGO does not solve all budgetary problems, it was the lack of such discipline that led to a near doubling of the long-term deficit over the course of just a few years in the early 2000s.

The bill, as approved by the House Appropriations Committee, is essential to the security of the United States.  With resources dedicated to diplomatic and development efforts, this legislation is a core piece of America\u2019s security strategy.  While U.S. military power provides a critical and effective tool for protecting the Nation, the investments in stability, security, and development in this legislation will enhance our ability to effectively address the range of threats that the country faces today.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  Administration Priorities   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s international affairs priorities that advance U.S. national security including expanding the Foreign Service, promoting the President\u2019s Global Health Initiative, and providing assistance to partners, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and the West Bank/Gaza.  The Administration also thanks the Committee for its support for the Millennium Challenge Corporation.  Global Health  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the President\u2019s Global Health Initiative and looks forward to working with the Congress on its planning and implementation.  The Administration appreciates funding for the bilateral Global HIV/AIDS and malaria programs at the President\u2019s requested levels, but urges the Congress to fully fund the request for the Neglected Tropical Disease program that works toward the elimination of several preventable and treatable diseases.   International Monetary Fund  The Administration strongly opposes provisions that affect U.S. participation in the International Monetary Fund and that would limit future efforts to respond to urgent and unanticipated financial crises.  Diplomatic Operations in Iraq  The Administration appreciates funding provided for Diplomatic and Consular Programs.  The Administration is concerned, however, about the reduction of over $200 million for Department of State operations in Iraq.  This reduction could hinder needed operational support and security programs during a key transition period for the U.S. presence in Iraq.    Multilateral Development Banks  While the Administration welcomes the funding provided for multilateral development banks, the Congress is urged to restore the requested funding of $85 million for arrears to the International Development Association (IDA).  These IDA arrears support grants to the very poorest countries, most of which are in Africa, and are also needed to prevent the United States from falling farther behind in meeting its commitment to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.  International Climate Assistance  The increase in international climate assistance proposed by the President is an important step to reestablish U.S. leadership in addressing global climate change.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for this activity, but the bill is still $351 million below the request, including a $300 million reduction to the request for Department of Treasury climate programs.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the President\u2019s request for climate assistance and to remove restrictions that limit the ability of the Clean Technology Fund to catalyze private-sector investment in cleaner, low-carbon technologies.  Civilian Stabilization Initiative  The Administration is concerned about the $168 million net reduction to the request for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative, which is a critical component of building civilian capacity to respond to pressing national security concerns.    Global Food Security  The President has announced his intention to double U.S. financial support for agricultural development in developing countries to \u201cgive people the tools they need to lift themselves out of poverty.\u201d  The Administration requested $1.36 billion for agricultural development. Of the total, Afghanistan and Pakistan make up roughly $350 million.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for this activity, but given the decreases in funding to key accounts that fund agricultural development, as well as the increases in funding levels for other crosscutting requirements, we are concerned that there will not be sufficient funding available in this Act to meet the President\u2019s goals.  The Congress is urged to provide sufficient flexibility so that the President can advance the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to agricultural development.   2  Constitutional Concerns  Consistent with the President\u2019s statement in signing the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, the Administration is concerned about section 7050 of the bill, which could constrain the President\u2019s authority as Commander-In-Chief.  Similarly, consistent with longstanding Executive Branch concerns about similar provisions, reflected recently in the President\u2019s statement in signing the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, and the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, language within sections 7026, 7030, 7054, 7069, 7070, 7071, 7081, and the International Monetary Fund amendment, could constrain the President\u2019s authority to conduct foreign affairs by directing Executive officials to adopt certain positions or objectives in negotiations and other diplomatic interactions.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address the constitutional concerns with respect to these provisions.  * * * * * * * 3  ", "The Administration supports legislation to expand financial assistance to small businesses and increase their access to capital.  Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and are responsible for nearly 65 percent of job creation.  The Administration is committed to helping entrepreneurs as they undertake new business ventures, expand existing ones, and hire more Americans in the process.    On October 21st, the President announced the Administration\u2019s proposals to more than double the maximum size of loans to small businesses that the Small Business Administration (SBA) can guarantee under the 7(a) loan program from $2 million to $5 million.  Similarly, maximum long-term financing that SBA provides through Certified Development Companies under the section 504 program is proposed to increase from $2 million to $5 million for standard borrowers and from $4 million to $5.5 million for manufacturers.  Finally, the maximum size for small business microloans would increase from $35,000 to $50,000.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on these proposals as H.R. 3854 continues to be developed in the legislative process.  H.R. 3854 includes a number of provisions that the Administration believes will provide much needed assistance to small businesses, such as increased maximum loan sizes for the SBA's flagship 7(a) and section 504 programs.  The bill also contains a number of additional provisions that the Administration believes can be modified to strengthen the assistance provided to small business, the engine of the Nation\u2019s economic recovery.  These provisions include new programs that overlap to varying degrees with current authorities or might expose taxpayers to higher than necessary costs.  To achieve a medium-term economic recovery that will create jobs and promote the expansion of small businesses overall, the Administration supports fiscally responsible approaches to expanding assistance for small businesses.     The Administration supports swift and aggressive action to ensure the Nation\u2019s small businesses have the capital they need to seize opportunities and create jobs.  Passage of H.R. 3854 in the House is an important step in the legislative process, and the Administration encourages the Congress to build on that foundation by incorporating the President's proposals to further assist small businesses.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3961, the Medicare Physician Payment Reform Act of 2009, and appreciates congressional efforts to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries and TRICARE patients continue to have access to care and their physician of choice.  In his FY 2010 Budget, the President recognized the need for comprehensive reform for the Medicare physician payment system.  The Administration believes Medicare and the country need to move toward a system in which doctors receive better incentives to provide their patients with higher quality and more efficient care.  H.R. 3961 takes additional steps to reform Medicare physician payments.  The Administration is pleased that the bill would eliminate the steep payment cut scheduled for 2010.  A cut of this magnitude could reduce access to physicians for Medicare beneficiaries throughout the country.  The Administration also supports the provisions that provide a boost to primary care providers by increasing payments for evaluation and management services, such as office visits.  H.R. 3961 would also create incentives for broader reforms for Medicare physician payments by encouraging the formation of accountable care organizations, in which groups of providers are jointly responsible for the quality and cost of health care services for beneficiaries with chronic conditions.  The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress to achieve comprehensive reforms to Medicare physician payments that will enhance efficient and high-quality care for beneficiaries and protect their choice of physicians.  H.R. 3961 is an important step forward in comprehensively reforming the way Medicare pays physicians to provide the very best care to the Nation\u2019s Medicare beneficiaries and the Administration urges the Congress to pass this legislation.   * * * * * * *        ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5297.  Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and where most new jobs begin.  One of the major challenges facing small business owners is access to the credit that they need to grow and hire.  The House legislation includes two important Administration proposals to help address that problem.  First, the legislation would establish a Small Business Lending Fund that provides incentives for smaller banks to make new loans.  Second, the legislation would establish a State Small Business Credit Initiative that would spur over $20 billion in new lending through innovative State-based programs at a time when States are being forced to cut back on them due to budget shortfalls.  In addition, related legislation that the Administration understands will be incorporated into H.R. 5297 includes the President\u2019s proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on owners of small business stock, a step that will spur investment, innovation, and job creation by small businesses.   In addition to the two lending initiatives described above, the Administration also looks forward to working with Congress on the initiatives the Administration has worked on with the House and Senate Small Business Committees that will allow creditworthy small businesses to expand and create jobs.  *  *  *  *  *  *  *    ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2647, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.  The Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee's continued strong support of our national defense, including its support for the Department's topline budget requests for both the base budget and for overseas contingency operations.  The Administration appreciates, among other things, the leadership of the Committee in supporting many of the President's initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have troubled histories, or that failed to demonstrate adequate performance when compared to other programs and activities needed to carry out U.S. national security objectives.  In addition, the Administration welcomes the Committee's support for the Secretary of Defense's plan to increase the size of the civilian acquisition workforce and reduce the Department's reliance on contractors for critical acquisition functions.  Also, the Administration appreciates that the Committee included authorities that are important to field commanders, such as the Commanders' Emergency Response Program and the authority to reimburse coalition partners.  While there are many areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration nonetheless has serious concerns with a number of provisions that could constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions, that depart from Secretary Gates' decisions reflected in the President's Fiscal Year 2010 Budget which carefully balanced fiscal constraints, program performance, strategic needs and capabilities, or that raise other issues.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns, some of which are outlined below, and to refine this legislation to align it more closely with national defense priorities.  F-22 Advance Procurement:  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions in the bill authorizing $369 million in advanced procurement funds for F-22s in FY 2011.  The collective judgment of the Service Chiefs and Secretaries of the military departments suggests that a final program of record of 187 F-22s is sufficient to meet operational requirements.  If the final bill presented to the President contains this provision, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto.   F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program:  The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $603 million for development and procurement of the alternative engine program, and the requirement for the Department to fund the alternative engine program in future budget requests to the President.  These changes will delay the fielding of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) capability and capacity, adversely impacting the Department's overall strike fighter inventory.  In addition, the  Administration objects to provisions of the bill that mandate an alternative engine program for the JSF.  The current engine is performing well with more than 11,000 test hours.  Expenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and impede the progress of the overall JSF program.  Alleged risks of a fleet-wide grounding due to a single engine are exaggerated.  The Air Force currently has several fleets that operate on a single-engine source.  The Administration also objects to the limit on the obligation of overall JSF development funding to 75% of the amount authorized until Department of Defense (DOD) has obligated all funds provided in FY 2010 for the alternative engine program.  If the final bill presented to the President would seriously disrupt the F-35 program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto.   Missile Defense:  The Administration thanks the Committee for authorizing the President's full funding request of $9.3 billion for missile defense programs, including $7.8 billion for the Missile Defense Agency.  These programs will protect the United States, our deployed forces, and allies against emerging missile threats.  However, the Administration has concerns with provisions limiting U.S. engagements with NATO and European allies regarding missile defenses.  Building Partner Capacity:  The Administration urges the inclusion of its proposals to build the capacity of partner-nation special and conventional forces in order to enhance and increase coalition participation in Afghanistan and Iraq.  These initiatives will directly reduce the pressure on U.S. forces.  These limited, one-year proposals, developed in close partnership with the Department of State, are necessary for timely implementation of our new Afghanistan policy.  Without these authorities, the United States would lose precious time in increasing the capacity and participation of our partners in that conflict and put additional U.S. personnel at risk.  The Administration also urges that authority for the \"Section 1207\" reconstruction stabilization assistance be funded as requested.  Strategic Airlift:  The Administration objects to provisions in the bill that require the Air Force to maintain a strategic airlift fleet of 316 aircraft.  The Department assesses aircraft requirement based on capability, not aircraft numbers.  The restriction impairs the Department's ability to manage the fleet and respond to combatant commanders' request for forces.  The Administration objects to restrictions on C-5 retirements for the same reason.  Futenma Replacement Facility, Okinawa:  The Administration objects to Section 2836, which would limit the Secretary's authority to exercise reasonable judgment regarding airfield operations at the Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF), which is planned for construction on Okinawa.  The current FRF configuration was agreed to during bilateral negotiations with the government of Japan, and this provision places the resulting International Agreement at risk.  National Security Personnel System:  The Administration objects to Section 1112 because legislative action on the National Security Personnel System (NSPS) is premature given the ongoing review by DOD and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  This review will produce findings and recommendations that will help DOD and OPM, working with the Congress, make informed decisions about the future of the program.  Of great concern is the provision prohibiting DOD from adding any person to a position under NSPS after June 16, 2009, which will cause significant, undue disruption to organizations currently operating under NSPS, potentially delaying the filling of thousands of positions and harming the Department's in-sourcing efforts.  2  Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System:  The Administration is concerned that Section 1113, which prohibits new Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS) conversions and mandates termination of the entire system, will prevent the Intelligence Community from transforming itself into a single enterprise that can recruit and retain a competitive workforce to meet our national security needs.  DCIPS is part of a broader effort to reward employee performance, called the National Intelligence Civilian Compensation Program (NICCP), which is modeled after the successful program within the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.  Aircraft Retirements:  The Administration objects to provisions of the bill that restrict aircraft retirements.  The Air Force has provided its analysis supporting accelerated aircraft retirements with the Congress.  Retirements accompanied by modifications and other enablers provide a smaller, but more flexible, lethal, and capable force.  The Air Force has provided a base-by-base summary of the restructuring, including mission end states.  The restrictions currently in the bill will impair the Department\u2019s ability to manage its fleet and manpower to accomplish national priority missions.   Extended Range Multi-Purpose (ER/MP) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle:  The Administration objects to a reduction of $163 million to the Extended Range Multi-Purpose Unmanned Aerial Vehicle program, which would result in a 50-percent cut of the ER/MP systems planned for FY 2010.  The ER/MP is an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance asset critical for force protection and current operations.    Full Funding:  The Administration is concerned that H.R. 2647 authorizes incremental funding of Military Construction projects, and authorizes the Navy to use advance procurement funds to begin construction of aircraft carriers.  As a matter of fiscal prudence, the Administration encourages full funding of these programs, consistent with the President's Budget.  Defense Environmental Cleanup:  The Administration objects to the $471 million reduction for the Department of Energy's Environmental Management program.  This reduction will significantly impede progress in cleaning up the legacy of waste and contamination resulting from nuclear weapons production.  * * * * * * *    3  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3170, making appropriations for financial services and general government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.  America\u2019s economic strength depends, in part, on a strong financial system with effective, impartial regulation that enforces the rules of the road and protects investors and consumers of all sizes.  That is why the President proposed new resources for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Products Safety Commission, and other Federal regulators, giving them the staffing and the resources necessary to pursue a more efficient and effective regulatory structure to better detect fraud and strengthen markets.  This legislation follows through on the President\u2019s request for robust resources for these agencies.  Similarly, the President proposed an aggressive program to identify fraud and reinforce program integrity.  It is estimated that Internal Revenue Service (IRS) efforts to address tax fraud recoup $5 for every $1 spent.  The Administration appreciates the commitment to this effort and to improving services for taxpayers that is demonstrated in the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  Administration Priorities   Internal Revenue Service Tax Enforcement.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for IRS Enforcement, fully funding the request and adopting the program integrity proposal for enhanced tax enforcement activities.  This critical program supports the Administration\u2019s initiatives to improve the fairness of our tax system, closing the gap between taxes owed and taxes paid, through a robust portfolio of new enforcement initiatives, particularly in the international tax area.  Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for CDFI, including $80 million requested to implement the Capital Magnet Fund.  Alcohol and Tobacco Tax & Trade Bureau (TTB).  The Administration urges the Congress to authorize the TTB to collect licensing and registration fees from producers, wholesalers, and retailers of beverage alcohol.  Funding TTB through fees would properly assign the cost of keeping consumers safe to those who profit from the sale of alcoholic beverages.  This proposal  would also bring TTB\u2019s funding mechanism in line with other regulatory agencies across the Government.  Efficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for proposed reductions, including the termination of additional Federal funding for the Christopher Columbus Fellowship Foundation and the Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation, programs that have historically been supported by endowed trust funds.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the President\u2019s other proposals, especially for those items that fund narrowly focused activities or duplicate existing programs that accomplish similar goals.  Department of the Treasury   The Administration strongly opposes the language in the bill that attempts to restore prior Chrysler and General Motors (GM) franchise agreements.  The auto companies, like many in the country, face difficult economic and fiscal decisions.  The Administration shares the Committee\u2019s concern for dealers affected by Chrysler and GM bankruptcy agreements, and has taken steps to help support viable dealerships during this transition.  For example, on July 1st, the Small Business Administration implemented a new program to provide guaranteed floor plan financing loans.  However, the decision by Chrysler and GM to rationalize their dealer networks was a critical part of their overall restructuring to achieve long-term viability in order to save jobs in the long run, and to improve the prospects for the companies\u2019 repayment of the substantial taxpayer investments.  Without the significant steps these automakers have taken to revamp their operations, the companies would have failed \u2013 imperiling every GM and Chrysler dealer in the country.  Under the automakers\u2019 new structure, the overwhelming majority of GM and Chrysler dealers will continue operating with the new companies.  The decision to invest taxpayer dollars into these companies required all stakeholders to make difficult sacrifices, and it would set a dangerous precedent, potentially raising legal concerns, to intervene into a closed Judicial bankruptcy proceeding on behalf of one particular group at this point.  The Administration appreciates the funding provided for the Office of Domestic Finance and Office of Tax Policy.  Additional staff in these offices will work on key aspects of the financial crisis, including implementation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and financial stability programs and key tax policy issues.    District of Columbia (D.C.)   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s full funding of many critical D.C. initiatives, including permanent housing assistance targeted for the District\u2019s homeless population, water and sewer infrastructure, and funds to support school improvement initiatives.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for continuing the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program for only those students currently enrolled in the program.  Small Business Administration   The Administration appreciates the strong support for the Small Business Administration\u2019s programs, which are particularly helpful during the current economic environment.    2  Executive Office of the President (EOP)   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the EOP, particularly in providing efficiencies through consolidating the budgets of the White House Office and the Office of Policy Development and the funding provided to the Office of Administration to stabilize and modernize the current antiquated and deteriorating information technology at the White House.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s efforts to improve the program integrity of Federal assistance programs administered by States by providing $40 million for this effort.  Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided for ONDCP.  However, the Administration is concerned that the Committee redirects funding requested for the National Media Campaign to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program.\u00a0 Constitutional Concerns  Section 714 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch to disclose, without discretion, certain classified and other privileged information, in which case it would intrude on the President\u2019s discharge of his constitutional authorities.     * * * * * * *  3  ", "The Administration supports the goal of H.R. 626, which would provide Federal employees with access to paid leave upon the birth, adoption, or fostering of a child.  Being able to spend time at home with a new child is a critical part of building a strong family.  The initial bonding between parents and their new child is essential to healthy child development and providing a firm foundation for the child\u2019s success in life.  Measures that support these relationships strengthen our families, our communities, and our nation.  The Federal government should reflect its commitment to these core values by helping Federal employees to care for their families as well as serve the public.  Providing paid parental leave has been successfully employed by a number of private-sector employers, and can help to make job opportunities accessible to more workers.    The Administration is currently reviewing existing Federal leave policies to determine the extent of their gaps and limitations.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to refine the details of this legislation to make sure it meets the needs of Federal agencies and employees, as well as their families.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration commends the House Energy and Commerce Committee for its extraordinary efforts in developing historic bipartisan comprehensive energy and climate legislation that creates the framework to accomplish these goals.  The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 2454.  For decades, the energy crisis has largely been ignored, imperiling our economy, our national security, and our planet.  The President has challenged all of us to make America the nation that leads the 21st century by unleashing innovation and utilizing advanced technology in the clean energy sector.  H.R. 2454 contains authorities to move the country in that direction.  This legislation would establish energy efficiency and clean energy requirements for U.S. electric utilities, promote advanced carbon capture and sequestration technology and clean transportation infrastructure and vehicles, and improve energy efficiency in buildings, lighting, and appliances.  H.R. 2454 would, for the first time, create a system of clean energy incentives designed to jumpstart the economy, address carbon pollution, and result in significantly reduced U.S. emissions.  The bill contains provisions to protect consumers, keep costs low, help sensitive industries transition to a clean energy economy, and promote domestic emission reduction efforts that will lead to real global emission reductions.  This legislation would strengthen U.S. leadership in the global effort to address climate change and encourage other nations in their efforts to prevent deforestation and adopt clean energy technology.  Further, the bill would advance ongoing U.S. efforts to understand and adapt to the myriad challenges posed by climate change and assist the most vulnerable countries to address its effects.  The Administration strongly supports a robust and effective agriculture and forestry offsets program and appreciates the efforts of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Agriculture Committee toward that end.  As this complex bill moves through the legislative process, the Administration feels strongly that the enacted bill must be consistent with our international obligations and an open and integrated global economic system.  It must meet the President's objectives of creating a clean economy through an efficient, cost-effective, and comprehensive approach that leverages the Nation's capacity for innovation, creates jobs, reduces dependence on oil, is consistent with the Administration's financial regulatory reform proposal, and makes the United States a leader in efforts to address climate change.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3628.  The Administration believes the DISCLOSE Act is a necessary measure so that Americans will know who is trying to influence the Nation\u2019s elections.  S. 3628 also prevents those who should not interfere in the Nation\u2019s elections \u2013 such as corporations controlled by foreign interests \u2013 from doing so.  Unless the strong new disclosure rules in S. 3628 are established, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Citizens United case will give corporations undue power to influence elections.  This bill is not perfect.  For example, the Administration would have preferred no exemptions.  But, by providing for unprecedented transparency, S. 3628 takes great strides to hold corporations that participate in the Nation\u2019s elections accountable to the American people.

However, the Administration would like to work with the Congress to address provisions that restrict the President's flexibility to conduct foreign affairs or that raise managerial, budgetary, constitutional, or other concerns so that the legislation is aligned with the Administration's foreign policy and management priorities.  This Statement of Administration Policy does not address H.R. 1886, although the Administration understands that the Rule proposes to incorporate this bill into H.R. 2410.  The Administration strongly supports the bill's inclusion of authorizations of appropriations at levels that will strengthen U.S. diplomatic capacity and will allow the United States to meet its financial obligations to the United Nations and other international organizations and to begin synchronizing payments to international organizations where the United States has been chronically late in paying its assessments.  The Administration also welcomes the inclusion of a number of authorities in the bill that support diplomatic operations.  In particular, the Administration supports the inclusion of authorities that eliminate the cut in basic pay faced by entry- and mid-level Foreign Service officers who serve overseas, facilitate the reemployment of retirees to support certain critical mission needs, and provide additional flexibility to manage State Department and Broadcasting Board of Governors personnel.   The Administration also welcomes the increased flexibility for the State Department to use registration fees collected under the Arms Export Control Act.  These many areas of agreement notwithstanding, the Administration has concerns about provisions in the bill that could constrain the ability of the President and the Secretary of State to conduct foreign affairs and manage the Department with the necessary degree of flexibility.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these concerns.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration supports House passage of an Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 2010 that would support the Intelligence Community (IC) and the Community\u2019s mission to conduct intelligence activities to protect the Nation.  The Administration appreciates the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's inclusion in H.R. 2701 of many provisions submitted by the Administration.    Although the Administration is pleased with the many favorable provisions in the bill, the Administration has serious concerns with a number of provisions that would impede the smooth and efficient functioning of the IC and that would raise a number of policy, management, legal, and constitutional concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns, some of which are outlined below, in order to enhance the effectiveness and capabilities of the IC on behalf of the Nation.   While the Administration appreciates the funding authorized for critical intelligence programs as described in the classified schedule, it has serious concerns with certain funding reductions and other matters in the classified schedule that will be addressed separately by the Administration.   Report on Covert Actions (Section 321).  The Administration strongly objects to section 321, which would replace the current \u201cGang of 8\u201d notification procedures on covert activities.  There is a long tradition spanning decades of comity between the branches regarding intelligence matters, and the Administration has emphasized the importance of providing timely and complete congressional notification, and using \u201cGang of 8\u201d limitations only to meet extraordinary circumstances affecting the vital interests of the United States.  Unfortunately, section 321 undermines this fundamental compact between the Congress and the President as embodied in Title V of the National Security Act regarding the reporting of sensitive intelligence matters \u2013 an arrangement that for decades has balanced congressional oversight responsibilities with the President\u2019s responsibility to protect sensitive national security information.  Section 321 would run afoul of tradition by restricting an important established means by which the President protects the most sensitive intelligence activities that are carried out in the Nation's vital national security interests.  In addition, the section raises serious constitutional concerns by amending sections 501-503 of the National Security Act of 1947 in ways that would raise significant executive privilege concerns by purporting to require the disclosure of internal Executive branch legal advice and deliberations.  Administrations of both political parties have long recognized the importance of protecting the confidentiality of the Executive Branch's legal advice and deliberations.  If the final bill presented to the President contains this provision, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto.      Increased Presidentially Appointed and Senate Confirmed (PAS) positions (Sections 424, 426, and 427).  H.R. 2701 creates five new PAS positions.  Consistent with the 9/11 Commission\u2019s recommendations, the Administration believes that if these provisions were to become law, critical national security positions would remain unfilled for significant periods of time and create disruption across the IC.  Further while the Administration agrees in concept to the establishment of Inspectors General, the Administration would want to work closely with the Congress to harmonize any new roles and responsibilities of a new Inspector General of the National Security Agency with those of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense.    Prohibiting the Implementation of the Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System (DCIPS) (Section 304).  The Administration is concerned that section 304 will prevent the IC from transforming itself into a single enterprise that can recruit and retain a competitive workforce to meet national security needs.  The DCIPS is consistent with a broader, long-standing pay-for-performance effort.  In addition, the substantial reduction in funds provided for the IC in transition to pay-for-performance will severely undermine the Administration's efforts to build an intelligence workforce for the 21st century.     Personnel Ceiling Adjustments (Section 103).  The Administration objects to section 103.  Congressionally imposed personnel ceilings on IC civilian employment are inflexible, force the use of often more expensive contractors, and severely hinder the IC\u2019s civilian joint duty, student employment, and National Intelligence Reserve Corps (NIRC) programs.  Inspector General for the Intelligence Community (Section 406).  The Administration supports the important work undertaken by Inspectors General in serving as watchdogs for transparency, accountability, and efficiency, and would like to work with the Congress on the optimal approach and authorities for carrying out the important functions of Inspectors General in the context of the IC.  Although the Administration supports section 406\u2019s expansion of the protections and limitations of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, the Administration is concerned that the bill as drafted could be understood to constrain the President\u2019s constitutional authority to review and, if appropriate, control disclosure of certain classified information.  Administration officials are working closely with Senate and House staff to craft appropriate whistleblower enhancement protections for intelligence community whistleblowers through separate legislative vehicles, H.R. 1507 and S. 372, and urge that the whistleblower enhancement provision in this bill account for Administration proposals offered in those contexts to address constitutional and other concerns with the current formulation.  GAO Review of Intelligence Community Matters (Section 335).  Section 335 would fundamentally shift the long-standing relationship and information flow between the IC and intelligence committee members and staff.  The Administration has committed to be forthcoming with the committees and to provide access to the information they need to conduct their oversight.  The Administration would welcome the opportunity to more fully address this matter before fundamental changes to the oversight process are legislated.  Reporting Requirements (various sections).  The Administration objects to a number of reporting requirements contained in the bill, such as sections 332, 345, 354, and 366, as well as purportedly in the classified annex.  Section 356 would incorporate by reference all reporting requirements in the classified annex into the act, thereby making them a requirement in law.  The Administration objects to the passage of such substantive secret provisions of law.  Further, such a provision would remove the flexibility that Congress and the Executive branch 2  would otherwise have to modify and adapt provisions in the classified annex to meet changing conditions and requirements without seeking a statutory change from the full Congress.  Prohibition on use of funds to provide Miranda warnings to certain persons outside of the United States (Section 504).  The Administration strongly objects to section 504, prohibiting Miranda warnings abroad, which may take the prosecution option off the table in the United States Government's fight against al Qaeda and its affiliates and deny the government an important tool used by the previous Administration to preserve legal options. Indeed, the practice in the previous Administration had been to provide Miranda warnings to persons outside of the United States, recognizing the value of preserving the option to prosecute terrorists in our system of justice.  The Nation needs at its disposal every tool in the national security toolbox, including the ability to bring terrorist prosecutions.    National Security Information (Section 502).  The Administration objects to this section, which would move the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE) into the Executive Office of the President.  The Administration is still reviewing how to make the PM-ISE most effective and believes such legislation is premature and could create undue administrative and managerial burdens by creating a completely new category of information for agencies to manage. The Administration would like to work with Congress to meet its goals through non-legislative means.   * * * * * * * 3  ", "The Administration strongly supports enactment of legislation that is important for the economic security of American workers and their families.  Accordingly, the Administration supports Senate passage of H.R. 4851, which will extend access to health care benefits for workers who have lost their jobs and extend unemployment insurance benefits for millions of Americans who are looking for work.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009.  The Ryan White program provides critical health care and related services to uninsured and underinsured people living with HIV/AIDS.  This legislation authorizes appropriations for the program for the next four years.    The Administration is committed to strengthening access to care for people living with HIV/AIDS. The legislation reauthorizes all parts of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program and supports continued funding for the Minority AIDS Initiative, the goal of which is to address the disproportionate impact of the disease on racial and ethnic minorities.  When the program was last reauthorized in 2006, the Congress took steps to ensure that the program adopted names-based HIV case data as a basis for funding allocations to direct resources to areas of greatest need.  This bill recognizes that some States\u2019 HIV case reporting systems are not yet fully matured, and continues funding for jurisdictions with HIV surveillance systems that are still transitioning.  In recognition of the growing epidemic outside of major urban areas with longstanding epidemics, it is important that the Ryan White program evolve and move towards determining funding allocations based on valid, reliable HIV surveillance data.  The legislation also supports continuing assistance to Transitional Grant Areas.  The Administration supports the provision in the legislation revising the threshold of unobligated balances that triggers penalties for unexpended grant funds.  In an effort to simplify administration of the Ryan White programs, the Administration strongly supports the inclusion of a provision to offset unobligated balances from subsequent grant awards rather than cancellation of unobligated amounts.  Implementation of the cancellation of unobligated balances has proven to be a barrier to efficient and timely disbursement and reallocation of these unexpended funds.  The Administration believes that the current bill makes important improvements in HIV/AIDS care and treatment and looks forward to working with the Congress on this effort to ensure that the Ryan White Program provides the most efficient, effective systems of care for people living with HIV/AIDS.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5851, the \u201cOffshore Oil and Gas Worker Whistleblower Protection Act of 2010,\u201d because it would provide important whistleblower protections to workers on the Outer Continental Shelf.  All workers should be able to protect their health and safety by reporting violations of the law or workplace hazards without fear of retaliation from their employers.  These protections are particularly important for workers whose lives depend on their employers\u2019 assurances of their safety.  Congressional hearings have revealed that workers on the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil drilling platform had significant safety concerns, but  feared they would lose their jobs if they spoke out.  Whistleblower protections must be meaningful so that workers feel secure enough to speak up when they see hazards going unaddressed.  There is currently no Federal law adequately protecting offshore workers who blow the whistle on worker health and safety hazards.  While there are some protections for workers who blow the whistle on environmental or pipeline safety violations, these are not uniform.  H.R. 5851 would extend strong whistleblower protections to workers on the Outer Continental Shelf, including workers who are part of a drilling or spill clean-up operation.  The bill would accomplish this by prohibiting retaliation against workers who, among other things, report violations relating to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act or refuse to perform their duties based on the good faith belief that the work could result in injury or illness, or could cause public harm, such as an oil spill.  H.R. 5851 also would provide that any covered worker who is a victim of retaliation be made whole by reinstatement, back pay, and compensatory and punitive damages.    For these reasons, the Administration strongly supports H.R. 5851, and urges its swift passage.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 2847, with the Senate Committee-reported text, making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, and Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.    As we face difficult economic and fiscal decisions, it is important to make efficient and effective investments.  The bill as considered by the Committee makes important investments in innovation and job creation, community safety, and cutting-edge technologies.  This legislation will help lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  Administration Priorities   Science and Innovation.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee\u2019s bill includes more than $200 million in reductions to requested levels for the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  These two agencies are key components of the President\u2019s Plan for Science and Innovation and the Committee\u2019s reductions would affect important research activities and agency operations in the near term and make it increasingly difficult to achieve the doubling goal for basic research in future years.  The bill includes $58 million in non-priority project funds for the National Institute of Standards and Technology that could be channeled to reduce this shortfall.  Efficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their usefulness, fund narrowly focused activities, or duplicate existing programs.  The Administration encourages the Congress to reconsider other proposals made by the Administration that would better target scarce resources and redirect funds to programs with greater potential for results.   Department of Commerce  The Administration appreciates the support shown for Department of Commerce programs, particularly for the 2010 Census, environmental stewardship, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, and Technology Innovation Program.  Economic Development Administration.  The Administration is concerned that the bill underfunds the Economic Development Administration request by nearly $50 million, particularly in light of  current economic conditions.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the $284 million requested, including $125 million for Economic Adjustment Assistance (EAA).  The $90 million the bill provides for EAA is not enough to fully implement the Administration\u2019s proposals to promote regional innovation clusters and create a Business Incubator Network.  The Administration has requested $50 million for each of these initiatives because they will help the Nation to develop dynamic businesses and respond effectively to challenging economic conditions.  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support of the important activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  However, within this funding level, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the additional $13 million requested to support accelerated improvement of hurricane track and intensity forecasts, which will help to prevent unnecessary and costly evacuations.  Additionally, the Administration urges the Congress to allocate resources based on a competitive and transparent process.  International Trade Administration.  The Administration is concerned with the language directing that negotiations be held within the World Trade Organization to allow its members to distribute antidumping and countervailing duties.  These duties are currently received by the Federal Government as general revenues; distributing them to domestic firms who already benefit from these tariffs would provide a \u201cdouble benefit.\u201d   United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for allowing USPTO full access to its fee collections.  The Administration agrees with the Committee that USPTO should evaluate long-standing examination goals for patent employees to account for advances in technology and other changes in the patent examination process.  USPTO is currently re-evaluating these goals and is working to obtain an independent review of them.  The Congress is urged to allow this process to proceed and remove the language in the bill that would block $25 million from obligation until new goals are adopted, to avoid unnecessary strain on USPTO\u2019s financial resources and operational flexibility.  Department of Justice  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of the funding requests for Department of Justice programs including those of the FBI and other law enforcement components. However, the Administration is concerned about the adequacy of funds provided for key initiatives such as the COPS Hiring Grants Program and the Prisoner Reentry Initiative and additional funds are needed to maintain critical technology initiatives.  Unfortunately, the Committee has only provided one third of the funding requested for the COPS Hiring Grant Program.  By providing the Administration\u2019s full request for this program, more than 1,500 police could be hired \u2013 or kept in their jobs \u2013 in cities and towns across the country.  The Administration is also disappointed that the Committee has provided no funding for Community-Based Violence Prevention Initiatives.  In addition, the changes made to section 505, in Division B of the FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act regarding reprogramming notifications, present significant management challenges for the Department in the execution of its law enforcement and other responsibilities and the Congress is urged to restore the language that was in effect prior to the Act.   2  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s FY 2010 request for NASA, including full funding for Science, Aeronautics, Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and Exploration Systems, and in the existing budget structure as proposed.  However, the Administration is concerned with the reduction of $18.7 million from the request for NASA innovation, which would reduce or eliminate several programs that use public-private partnerships to advance important technologies and enable access to new sources of innovation through incentive prizes and partnerships.  National Science Foundation  The Administration believes the directed transfer of icebreaker operations and maintenance funding from the National Science Foundation to the Coast Guard is premature pending the outcome of several active policy reviews being conducted over the next two years that will better inform mission requirements for the U.S. polar icebreaker fleet going forward.   Legal Services Corporation (LSC)  The Administration appreciates the Committees modification of the restriction on the use of non-LSC funds by LSC grant recipients but also urges the Congress to allow LSC attorneys to collect fees and to participate in class action lawsuits.  These riders limit access to legal representation and constrain legal aid lawyers\u2019 ability to secure settlements and to pursue injunctive relief to stop illegal activity.  In addition, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the President\u2019s request.  Constitutional Concerns  Consistent with longstanding Executive Branch concerns about similar provisions, sections 107 and 528 and language under the headings \u201cOperations and Administration, International Trade Administration\u201d and \u201cSalaries and Expenses, Office of the United States Trade Representative\u201d would interfere with the President\u2019s constitutional authority in the area of foreign affairs by effectively directing the Executive how to proceed or not to proceed in international negotiations.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns.  * * * * * * *  3  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5893.  Passage of this legislation will provide much-needed relief to families, encourage continued job creation by America\u2019s businesses, and provide critical assistance to hard-pressed States, including funding to create and support jobs in the private and public sectors.  In addition, H.R. 5893 includes revenue-raising provisions similar to those included in the President\u2019s Budget, including proposals to close international tax loopholes that currently allow companies to inappropriately lower their U.S. taxes.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on these and additional job-creation measures.    * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 3454, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011.  The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee's continued support of our national defense, including, among other things, its support for the Department's topline budget requests for both the base budget and for overseas contingency operations.  The Administration welcomes the Committee's support for authorities that assist the ability of the warfighter to operate in unconventional and irregular warfare environments, authorities that are important to field commanders, such as the authority to reimburse coalition partners.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee supports the President\u2019s budget request, specifically by not authorizing funding for additional C-17 aircraft or for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) extra engine and by authorizing the phased adaptive approach for missile defense in Europe.  There are many areas of agreement with the Committee\u2019s bill as reported; however, the Administration has concerns with some of the restrictions placed on the Department of Defense, including potentially limiting its ability to effectively advance its priorities and streamline operations.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns, some of which are outlined in more detail below, and others which may be identified in a classified annex once it is made available.  National Guard Deployment to Secure the Southwest Border:  The Administration strongly objects to Section 1041, which the Administration would construe to require the Secretary of Defense to authorize the funding for deployment, under title 32, United States Code, of at least 6,000 National Guard personnel to undertake operations such as constructing fences and border checkpoints, surveying the border, and providing radio communication interoperability among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, until the Secretary, in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security and the Governors of the border states, certifies to Congress that the Federal Government has achieved \u201coperational control\u201d of the border.  The legislation would unduly interfere with the President\u2019s role as Commander in Chief with respect to the management of the Total Force.  The Administration continues to pursue a comprehensive, multi-layered, targeted approach to law enforcement and security on the southwest border.  Within this approach, the National Guard will be utilized to meet specific, requirements-based needs where they can implement missions using their unique capabilities.    Building Partner Capacity and Foreign Policy:  The Administration urges the inclusion of its requested proposals, which were developed with close coordination between the Departments of Defense and State, to build the capacity of partner-nation special and conventional forces.  Among other things, these proposals are important for the implementation of U.S. policy in Afghanistan, to enhance and increase coalition participation in Afghanistan in order to reduce the  pressure on U.S. forces, and to support the drawdown strategy in Iraq and counter-terrorism programs.  To ensure consistency with broader foreign policy objectives, the Administration urges that any new foreign policy or assistance related authorities or requirements to do reports or determinations should require concurrence of the Secretary of State, particularly those in sections 1304 and 1534.  Commanders\u2019 Emergency Response Program (CERP):  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s continued support for this critical program, but urges the restoration of funding to the requested amount of $1.3 billion.  The CERP remains a critical enabler in support of the responsible drawdown in Iraq and provides the people of Afghanistan with tangible, positive economic opportunities and improvements at the local level, leveraging the execution of the shape, clear, hold, and build aspects of our strategy.  Iraqi Security Forces Fund (ISFF):  The Administration objects to the $1 billion reduction to the ISFF, and the limitation placed on the obligation of these funds.  Full funding of the ISFF is critical to the development of the Iraqi military and police so that they possess the minimum essential capabilities necessary for internal security and external defense.  Reducing the request would impede the transition of responsibility necessary to complete the drawdown of U.S. forces in a responsible manner.  The new requirement for a determination on Iraqi commitment to build security forces and the new authority to accept contributions should require concurrence of the Secretary of State to ensure consistency with broader foreign policy objectives.    Policy Concerning Homosexuality in the Armed Forces:  The Administration supports section 591 as it would allow for completion of the Comprehensive Review, enable the Department of Defense to assess the results of the review, and ensure that the implementation of the repeal is consistent with the standards of military readiness, effectiveness, unit cohesion, recruiting and retention.  Such an approach recognizes the critical need to allow our military and their families the full opportunity to inform and shape the implementation process through a thorough understanding of their concerns, insights and suggestions.   Restrictions on Guantanamo Detainee Transfers:  The Administration strongly objects to Section 1044, which prohibits the use of Department of Defense funds to transfer individuals held at the detention facilities at Guantanamo to the countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen for one year following enactment of this bill.  Individual detainee transfer determinations should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all factors, including the threat posed by the particular detainee, U.S. legal obligations and broader U.S. national security interests.  This provision restricts the United States\u2019 ability to make these case-by-case decisions for over seventy percent of the detainees being held at Guantanamo.  By precluding transfers to these countries, section 1044 poses serious national security concerns, including by reducing the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to negotiate transfer conditions that promote national security.  Guam Basing:  The Administration is committed to addressing the needs in Guam (both on base and off) to allow for the realignment of Marines and their families from Japan.  That effort requires a comprehensive government-wide approach.  The Administration is concerned with the  $320 million reduction in funding for Navy construction in Guam.  Deferral of funding requirements into future years or reductions to the program will increase the total cost to the United States of the realignment.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to provide additional details on program implementation to address the Committee\u2019s concerns.  2  Defense Weather Satellites:  The Administration objects to the committee\u2019s reduction of $241.8 million in funding for the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) program.  The decision to restructure the program, taken in February, was designed to address chronic budget, schedule, and management difficulties.  DoD\u2019s senior leadership recently approved a long-term, follow-on weather satellite program to NPOESS \u2013 the Defense Weather Satellite System (DWSS).  The Committee\u2019s reduction would significantly hinder the Department from taking the necessary steps to implement DWSS and to transition critical assets and data to NOAA, potentially resulting in future gaps in military and civil weather satellite coverage.  The reduction could also result in terminating major elements of the existing program, impairing development of NOAA\u2019s Joint Polar Satellite System program, and incurring an otherwise avoidable termination liability for both DoD and Commerce.    National Nuclear Security Administration Program Reductions:  The Administration objects to reductions to key weapons programs, including the W76 Life Extension, Plutonium Infrastructure Sustainment, Kansas City Responsive Infrastructure, Tritium Readiness, and Fissile Materials Disposition programs.  Failure to provide the requested funding for these programs would delay essential stockpile support and nuclear infrastructure modernization in support of the Nuclear Posture Review and would reduce NNSA\u2019s ability to attain the W76 Life Extension Program production rates needed to meet Navy requirements.    Expansion of the Defense Production Act:  The Administration objects to section 214, which  authorizes the use of Defense Production Act Title III authorities to develop advanced technologies for ground vehicles without a determination that the industry involved is essential to the national defense and that government assistance is required for the production of the systems and technologies.  Early stage development of advanced technologies for military vehicles is best addressed in the Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation title. Incremental and Full Funding:  The Administration is concerned that the committee is authorizing incremental funding of military construction projects.  As a matter of fiscal prudence, the Administration encourages full funding of these programs, which is consistent with the President\u2019s Budget.    Commission on Military Environmental Exposures:  The Administration objects to section 314, directing the President to establish a commission of non-federal scientific experts to develop compensation decisions under controlling law and regulations for current and former members of the armed forces and their dependents based on the potential for exposure to environmental hazards at military installations.  A commission made up of scientific experts should address scientific issues, while accountable government policy officials should make military and veterans benefits and entitlement recommendations.  Also, until exposures resulting in health implications are established, it is premature to consider the issue of benefits and entitlements.  The Administration would be pleased to work with the Congress in developing language that would address this matter in a manner that will advance the science as well as promote additional protection to our members and their dependents from such exposures.   Contracts for Commercial Imaging Satellite Capacities:  The Administration objects to Section 142, which requires that DoD only procure the capacity of commercial imagery satellites with 1.5 meter telescopes after December 31, 2010.  The planned next generation of commercial imagery satellites will use a 1.1 meter aperture.  Since the commercial satellite industry does not currently build 1.5 meter satellites, this provision would require considerable additional government investment, and is not required to meet defense or intelligence requirements.  3  Further, by stipulating a predetermined commercial solution, this provision could negatively impact the commercial data providers, limit innovation in commercial technology, and increase the risks on future government contracts for commercial data services.    Iran.  The Administration strongly supports P.L. 111-195, the recently enacted comprehensive Iran sanctions legislation, and is very concerned that a related section in S. 3454 (section 818) could conflict with P.L.111-195.  The Administration urges that no new provisions on Iran be included in light of the comprehensiveness of the recently enacted sanctions legislation.   Troops to Teachers Program:  The Administration urges the Senate\u2019s support for the transfer of the Troops to Teachers Program to DoD in FY 2011, as reflected in the President\u2019s Budget and DoD\u2019s legislative proposal to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and Title 10 of the U.S. Code.  The move to Defense will help ensure that this important program supporting members of the military as teachers is retained and provide better oversight of program outcomes by simplifying and streamlining program management.  The Administration looks forward to keeping the Congress abreast of this transfer, to ensure it runs smoothly and has no adverse impact on program enrollees.    Restoration of Policy Regarding Use of Medical Facilities:  The Administration supports section 713, which would restore a policy to ensure that servicewomen and military dependents \u2013 including nearly 50,000 servicewomen stationed overseas \u2013 have the ability to obtain abortion services using their own, private funds.   * * * * * * *    4  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 4213.  Passage of this legislation will provide much-needed relief to families, including extended access to health care benefits for workers who have lost their jobs and extended unemployment insurance benefits for millions of Americans who are looking for work.  It will also provide critical assistance to hard-pressed States while encouraging continued job creation by America\u2019s businesses.  The importance of longer-term extensions for various authorities and programs \u2013 and the certainty that such extensions bring \u2013 has been highlighted by the severe problems caused by interruptions in authorities for these programs.  The House Amendment contains several important provisions, including:  (1) an extension of extended unemployment insurance and COBRA subsidies through the end of the year; (2) reform of the physician payment formula; (3) an extension of increased American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rates that allow for additional Federal support for State Medicaid programs; (4) an extension of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Emergency Fund to continue support for State-subsidized employment programs for needy parents and youth, among other purposes; (5) an extension of ARRA subsidies so that the Small Business Administration can continue certain lending programs with reduced fees and higher guarantees; (6) additional resources to create summer jobs for youth; (7) targeted pension-funding relief; and (8) extension of provisions that will support affordable housing and create jobs.  The President has long supported comprehensive, fiscally responsible reform of the physician payment formula to improve the quality of care. The House Amendment provision represents significant progress toward that goal, and the Administration strongly supports its passage.  The Administration applauds the Congress for including provisions in the bill to fulfill the obligations set forth in the Cobell and Pigford II settlement agreements.  The settlements that have been achieved are historic and provide full and final resolution to two long-running disputes \u2013 a case involving the management of individual Indian trust accounts related to Indian lands and claims of prior discrimination brought by black farmers against the Department of Agriculture.  The bill also includes several other important measures supported by the Administration.  The extensions to expiring tax cuts include several provisions that will encourage companies to invest in new technologies and create more high-tech jobs for the 21st century, including extending the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit for another year.  The legislation also extends the tax credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel, providing clean energy companies with the certainty they need to make critical investments in the Nation\u2019s energy future.     Finally, the House Amendment includes revenue-raising provisions similar to those included in the President\u2019s budget, including proposals to close international tax loopholes that currently allow companies to shift profits among overseas jurisdictions to lower their U.S. taxes and a sensible proposal to make certain that investment managers pay taxes on their earnings at rates closer to the ordinary income tax rates paid by other workers in the Nation\u2019s economy.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on these and additional measures to spur private sector job creation, including measures focused on small businesses (including lending provisions, zero capital gains for small businesses and bonus depreciation) and energy (including retrofits and an expansion of the 48C tax credit for manufacturing).     * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3288, making appropriations for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010.  The President believes that America\u2019s economic success in the 21st Century depends significantly on a modernized infrastructure, from roads and highways to high-speed rail, inland waterways, and housing.  These infrastructure investments will help build a new foundation for long-term economic growth to benefit the American people for years to come.  The President requested, and the Committee approved, significant increases in 21st Century transportation with new resources for the Nation\u2019s road, rail, and air transportation systems. The legislation takes an important step toward modernizing what has become an outdated and over-stressed transportation network.  Importantly, the legislation not only invests in new systems, but also works to improve the safety of those systems already in place.  Increased transit and air travel safety dollars will result in fewer accidents and more lives saved.   Additionally, the funding included in the legislation for housing and community development programs can serve as important anchors to locally driven innovations.  With a strengthened safety net for Americans facing significant hardship in these challenging economic times together with funds dedicated to revitalizing local communities and expanding opportunities, this legislation will help the Nation\u2019s urban and rural areas alike.  These efforts are complimentary to the Administration\u2019s desire to work with the Congress to launch the Housing Trust Fund, which would expand the rental housing supply available for very low-income families.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  Administration Priorities  National Infrastructure Bank and High Speed Rail.  The Administration appreciates the support for up to $2 billion for a National Infrastructure Bank, an important Administration priority, and looks forward to working with the Congress to authorize the Bank as soon as possible.  Once established, the Bank will play a key role in supporting regionally and nationally significant, high-value, multi-modal projects selected on the basis of merit.  The Administration also thanks the Committee for capital grants for high-speed and intercity passenger rail corridor expansion.     Combat Mortgage Fraud.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Combat Mortgage Fraud initiative, which will support a strong response to abusive practices that have taken advantage of home loan borrowers and contributed to financial market turmoil.  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s pledge to fully fund CDBG, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to consider reforms to the program, particularly modernizing the outdated funding formula to target funds to economically distressed communities more effectively, resulting in increased accountability.    Choice Neighborhoods.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide $250 million requested for Choice Neighborhoods, which would support the Administration\u2019s broader effort to fight concentrated poverty and revitalize neighborhoods.    Efficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals. The Administration urges the Congress to support the President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their usefulness, fund narrowly focused activities, or duplicate existing programs, including the Rail Line Relocation Program for which funds are not distributed through a need- or merit-based process and an alternative program achieves the same goal.  Department of Transportation (DOT)  The Administration is pleased that the Committee supports the President\u2019s request for DOT.  The Administration appreciates the provision of capital funding for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which will help WMATA to address safety shortfalls within its rail system.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the funding provided to the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Next Generation Air Transportation System.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for Tenant-Based Rental Assistance, Project-Based Rental Assistance, and Public Housing programs.  This funding is especially important in light of the current economic environment.    The Administration urges the Congress to provide the full $100 million request for the Energy Innovation Fund to support local initiatives that remove barriers to efficiency and leverage private sector funds.  The Fund will allow for the identification of the most effective practices for replication across the Nation, increasing the dividends of energy efficiency investments in housing.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for HUD\u2019s new Transformation Initiative, which sets aside funds for HUD to become a more innovative and accountable agency.

The Administration agrees with the sponsors of H.R. 2101 that the defense-acquisition process needs improvement in the areas of systems engineering, developmental test and evaluation, technological maturity, and cost estimation, and that changes are needed to strengthen a culture of acquisition excellence in the Department of Defense.  The Administration is committed to making trade-offs among cost, schedule, and performance to significantly reduce cost growth in major defense acquisition programs.  The Administration wants to ensure that the defense acquisition process is free from conflicts of interest and that the process supports the U.S. Government being a better steward of the taxpayers' dollars.  The Administration believes that H.R. 2101, with some changes that we believe can satisfactorily be resolved, would enable the Administration to meet those objectives.   *  *  *  *  *  *      ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of health insurance reform legislation.

The legislation also provides the resources necessary to keep food and medicines safe and reliable.  It provides critical support for farmers to continue the Nation\u2019s leading role in feeding the world.  In addition, this legislation addresses chronic problems facing Americans, including poverty, nutrition, and housing.  Moreover, the legislation responds to the President\u2019s call for investments in programs that work while ending programs that do not.

The Administration appreciates that USDA\u2019s renewable energy, small business programs, and food safety programs are funded at the requested level.  Efficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.  The Administration encourages the Congress to support the President\u2019s initiatives to terminate or reduce programs that have outlived their usefulness, fund narrowly focused activities, or duplicate existing programs, such as public broadcast grants to help  the digital conversion.  The FY 2010 Budget proposed to support public broadcasting through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and eliminate the duplicative USDA Public Broadcast Grants program.  The Administration urges the Congress to accept this termination since digital conversion is largely complete and CPB has funding that can be used to complete any remaining conversion needs.  Food Safety and Inspection Service    The Administration is concerned with section 744 of the bill which deals with food safety issues.  The Administration would like to work with the Congress to address the issues raised by the Committee in a manner that would protect the Nation\u2019s food supply and be consistent with international trade obligations.  Food and Nutrition Service  The Administration is pleased with the Committee\u2019s support for strengthening nutrition assistance programs by including funding for food banks, community-based food providers, fully funding WIC, and by supporting a pilot initiative to help increase elderly participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.  Farm Service Agency  The Administration appreciates the funding provided for the Farm Service Agency\u2019s Information Technology Modernization, which will allow the agency to continue modernizing its antiquated information technology systems.   Rural Development  The Administration appreciates that the majority of Rural Development programs are funded at the President\u2019s requested levels.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides the requested increase to strengthen FDA\u2019s efforts to make food and medical products safer.  The requested funding will allow FDA to work with domestic and foreign industries to develop new control measures for all levels of the supply chain, improve and increase risk-based inspections, and respond more effectively with rapid and targeted product tracing when problems do occur.  Investing in the Basic Sciences and Agricultural Research    The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s goal of investing in the basic agricultural sciences.

The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the President\u2019s goal of increasing access to broadband.  However, the President\u2019s request provided an increase in loan funding which the Committee moves into grants, resulting in a decrease in loan support of $132 million.  This reduction will slow expansion of broadband into rural America.  Rural Revitalization.  The FY 2010 Budget requested an increase of $70 million for rural revitalization grants.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee provides less than $10 million of the requested increase, including no increase for Secondary and Post-Secondary Education, Institution Challenge Grants, or the Quality of Life Program.  Renewable Energy.  The Administration appreciates the support the Committee has provided to the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Rural Business programs.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to fund the Rural Energy for America program at the full  requested amount.  This program is necessary in promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy in rural communities.  Efficiencies and Cost-Saving Proposals.

Once completed, the multi-year stabilization and modernization plan, dubbed \u201cMIDAS,\u201d will allow the agency to provide program benefits in a more efficient, accurate, and responsive manner.

It meets the President\u2019s criteria for health insurance reform:  it assures that all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care that is there when they need it and does so without adding a dime to the deficit.  This legislation is the product of unprecedented cooperation and countless hours of hard work by Members of the House of Representatives who share the President\u2019s conviction that the Nation cannot wait another year for health insurance reform.  They have forged a strong consensus that represents an historic step forward.   The House legislation includes critical reforms to the insurance industry, so that Americans will no longer have to worry that they will be denied coverage, or that their coverage will be dropped or watered down when they need it most.  It covers virtually all Americans and ensures that all Americans with health insurance are protected against high out-of-pocket spending.  The Administration is pleased that the bill includes a public health insurance option offered in an exchange.  As the President has said throughout this process, a public option that competes with private insurers is one of the best ways to ensure the choice and competition that are so badly needed in today\u2019s market.  The House bill also includes important health care delivery system reforms, and would extend the solvency of Medicare\u2019s hospital insurance trust fund.  Its Medicare and Medicaid policies promote integrated care, quality care, and primary care.  It invests in research on the most effective treatments, prevention, and the health care workforce.  It also makes critical improvements for Medicare beneficiaries including closing the coverage gap in the Medicare drug benefit known as the donut hole.

Defense Matters    The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for the ongoing military, diplomatic, and intelligence operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.  The bill also provides improved protection to our forces against the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices and increased funding to provide wounded servicemembers with the highest quality care.

However, the Administration is concerned about the omission of authorizations for the Contributions to Multilateral Development Banks.  The Administration urges the House to include language authorizing the 15th Replenishment for the International Development Association (IDA15) and 11th Replenishment for the African Development Fund (AfDF11). These authorizations are necessary for the United States to meet its international commitments to these institutions and to the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), as well as to maintain leadership as we push for management reforms at both banks.   The Congress provided funds for  these institutions in P.L. 111-8, the \"Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009.\"  Without the necessary authorizations, Treasury cannot make the IDA15 payment before June 30, 2009, and the United States will fall farther behind in meeting its MDRI commitment.  2009-H1N1 Influenza    The Administration appreciates the Committee's inclusion of additional resources to respond to the current 2009-H1N1 influenza outbreak and to prepare for a possible future pandemic influenza.  The Administration also commends the Committee for providing some flexibility within the resources to address the 2009-H1N1 outbreak.  Out of an abundance of caution, the President requested $1.5 billion and flexibility to enhance our Nation\u2019s capability to respond domestically and internationally.  The Administration believes that the unpredictable outbreak merits appropriation of funds to a new account in the Executive Office of the President for a Federal-wide assessment and coordination of the resources to respond to this situation.

These investments are designed to further new solutions to create new industries and new opportunities for Americans for decades to come.  This bill invests in the sciences, encouraging innovative technologies that will be central to the Nation\u2019s energy independence.  The legislation makes long overdue commitments to improved infrastructure, focusing on high-return investments and the reliable operation of those facilities that are of central importance to the Nation.

The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s recognition of the need to analyze alternatives for the future of LANSCE.  Department of Energy  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Administration urges the Congress to restore $68 million for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The research and development of solar energy and building technologies are two areas where investments can make large contributions toward a clean energy economy.     Energy Innovation Hubs and RE-ENERGYSE.  The Administration strongly urges support for the Energy Innovations Hubs and RE-ENERGYSE.  The Hubs will advance highly promising areas of energy science and technology from their early stages and RE-ENERGYSE will encourage tens of thousands of American students to pursue careers in science, engineering, and entrepreneurship related to clean energy.    Office of Nuclear Energy.  The Administration is concerned with the Committee\u2019s reallocation of funds among nuclear energy programs because it reduces the critical investment in longer-term research and development, undermining the goal of building a solid foundation for the long-term use of safe and secure nuclear power.  Energy Information Agency.  The Administration urges the Congress to restore funds to allow the Energy Information Agency to undertake important energy analysis and statistical work, such as gathering critical information to understand energy use and the performance of Federal energy efficiency programs and to improve the statistical reliability of home energy use data.  Power Marketing Administrations.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee adopted the proposal to reclassify power receipts from mandatory to discretionary to offset the annual expenses of the Southeastern, Southwestern, and Western Power Administrations.  This will allow for better operations and maintenance planning and execution, leading to a more reliable power system.  National Nuclear Security Administration.  The elimination of the $65 million funding for the B61 refurbishment study in FY 2010 will cancel refurbishment activities associated with replacing the B61 end-of-life components.

It covers virtually all Americans and ensures that all Americans with health insurance are protected against high, out-of-pocket spending.  The Administration is pleased that the bill includes a public health insurance option offered in an Exchange.  As the President has said throughout this process, a public option that competes with private insurers is one of the best ways to provide the choice and competition that are so badly needed in today\u2019s market.  The Senate bill also includes important health care delivery system and insurance reforms and cost-containment initiatives, and it would extend the solvency of Medicare\u2019s hospital insurance trust fund.  The Administration is also pleased that the bill creates an Independent Medicare Advisory Board.  The bill\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid policies promote integrated care, quality care, and primary care.  It invests in research on the most effective treatments, prevention, and the health care workforce.  It also makes critical improvements for Medicare beneficiaries including beginning to address the coverage gap in the Medicare drug benefit known as the donut hole.  In addition, it provides new options for long-term care.  The bill includes important program integrity protections that will safeguard Medicare and Medicaid from fraud, waste, and abuse.  Moreover, the Senate bill is not only fully paid for, but also reduces the deficit by $130 billion in the first decade and by more than half a trillion dollars in the next decade.  This bill provides the necessary health reforms that the Administration seeks \u2013 affordable, quality care within reach for the tens of millions of Americans who do not have it today, and stability and security for the hundreds of millions who do.  The Administration appreciates the hard work of the Senate on this bill, which contributes to transforming the health care system.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to enact health insurance reform and urges quick action on this landmark bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration commends the House for acting promptly to move bipartisan legislation to expand high-quality service opportunities and position the Corporation for National and Community Service to support both growth and excellence in the programs it oversees.  The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1388, which will expand national service programs and strengthen the capacity of the Corporation to manage a dramatic increase in service opportunities.    The Administration is pleased that H.R. 1388 would set the Corporation on a path toward 250,000 members.  The Administration is strongly committed to this growth, and at the same time, supports measures that enable the Corporation to maintain high-quality programs and manage growth effectively.  The Administration applauds the bill's focus on service learning and provisions that would increase the Eli Segal Education award and link future increases in award amounts to the maximum Pell Grant awards.  The Administration has called upon Americans from all walks of life to take part in civic renewal, and is therefore pleased that H.R. 1388 also would expand and improve service opportunities for seniors.  In particular, the Administration applauds the responsible and balanced introduction of competition into the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, which would better position the program for expansion.  Competition should be introduced across all of the Senior Corps programs, improving the quality of service opportunities for seniors while introducing greater accountability and innovation.  As the Federal investment in national service programs increases, the Administration is committed to making the programs more accountable and cost-effective, and supports the many ways in which H.R. 1388 would foster this.  In particular, the Administration supports the bill's provisions to consolidate funding in AmeriCorps, giving the Corporation flexibility to support the best programs.  The Administration is also pleased that the Committee on Education and Labor added to the bill expanded authority for fixed-amount grants that simplify reporting requirements, ease burdens on grantees, and strengthen accountability for performance.    The Administration is pleased that the Committee added to the bill the President's Budget initiative to create a \"Social Innovation Fund\" to provide seed money and scale up innovative and evidence-based efforts in the nonprofit sector to address social problems, leveraging private and foundation capital to meet major social challenges.     H.R. 1388 couples expanded and improved national service with the structural changes needed to support growth and produce excellent results for the participants and our Nation.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to perfect the bill and get this important legislation enacted.        * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration supports enactment of legislation to strengthen the Nation's housing sector and facilitate the goals of the Administration's Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan to help millions of American homeowners keep their homes.  Accordingly, the Administration supports Senate passage of S. 896 and looks forward to working with the Congress to refine the legislation to better align it with the Administration\u2019s housing policy.  In particular, the Administration supports modifications to the HOPE for Homeowners program, which will ease restrictions on eligibility and enable refinancing of underwater mortgages for a greater number of borrowers.  The Administration also supports appropriate changes to facilitate cost-neutral loan modifications for federally guaranteed rural housing loans and FHA loans.    In the context of the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, the Administration supports giving servicers appropriate authority and incentives to make loan modifications that are affordable.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that any safe harbor, if necessary, provides appropriate authority and incentives for lenders and servicers to make loan modifications that are affordable to at-risk homeowners, and also provides appropriate contractual protections that encourage mortgage financing in the future.  Similarly, the Administration supports the creation of a nationwide Mortgage Fraud Task Force to address mortgage fraud and deter and prosecute those people responsible for mortgage rescue fraud schemes, but recommends that the definition of mortgage fraud be revised to include all mortgage-related fraud perpetrated against borrowers.  The Administration supports making permanent the increase of Federal deposit insurance coverage to $250,000 for insured depository institutions (i.e., banks, thrifts, and credit unions) and increasing the ability of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration to borrow from the Treasury Department.  The Administration is supportive of the Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund only as a temporary measure to address challenges with the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to make changes to improve the Share Insurance Fund\u2019s ability to better manage all liquidation payments and the impact those payments have on the credit union industry.  The Administration also supports appropriately tailored bankruptcy legislation to provide a mechanism for homeowners who are out of other options to file for bankruptcy and implement a responsible plan to pay the debts that they are able to pay.  Notwithstanding the Senate vote on the Durbin Amendment, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address this issue.     *  *  *  *  *  *  *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5973, making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013.    Last summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  The BCA created a framework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that would bring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national priorities.  Departing from the bipartisan agreement reached in the BCA and departing from these caps, the House of Representatives put forward a topline discretionary funding level for FY 2013 that, for example, would cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially seniors, veterans, and children \u2013 as well as degrade many of the basic Government services on which the American people rely such as air traffic control and law enforcement.  In addition, these cuts were made in the context of a budget that fails the test of balance, fairness, and shared responsibility by giving millionaires and billionaires a tax cut and paying for it through deep cuts, including to discretionary programs.  In addition to the concern outlined above, the Administration strongly opposes the bill as reported by the Committee.  The bill severely undermines key investments in financial oversight in a manner that would cripple Wall Street reform.  It also imposes harmful cuts in rural economic development, renewable energy development, nutrition programs, food safety, and international food aid.  Investing in these areas is critical to the Nation's economic growth, security, and global competitiveness. The Administration also strongly objects to the inclusion of any ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5973, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  Rural Development.  The Administration appreciates that several Rural Development programs are funded at the FY 2013 Budget requested levels.  However, funding for the Rental Assistance Grants  falls $18 million short of the amount needed for expiring rental assistance contract renewals expected in FY 2013, eliminating nearly 4,600 units of rental assistance for rural America.  The Administration urges the House to provide the requested $907 million, which would continue the support of rents for USDA financed properties on behalf of the tenants who receive subsidized rent.  In addition, the funding for Distance Learning, Telemedicine and Broadband programs is $20 million below the FY 2013 Budget request, and the bill also proposes to rescind balances that would otherwise support broadband deployment in rural America.  The Administration urges the House to provide the requested $47 million in the FY 2013 Budget for the programs to advance economic recovery, foster job growth, and improve health care and education in rural America.    Grants Funding.  The Administration is concerned that the $277 million provided for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative competitive grant program, a significant reduction from the $325 million requested in the FY 2013 Budget, would prevent USDA from fully responding to the serious challenges of climate change, world food hunger, food safety, human nutrition, and sustainable bioenergy.   Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  The Administration is concerned with the funding level for WIC in the bill and encourages the House to provide the $7 billion level requested in the FY 2013 Budget.  WIC program costs are highly variable.  The Committee's low funding level creates a risk that the contingency reserve, which is normally used to cover unexpected changes in food prices or participation, would be needed to cover anticipated costs, thus threatening the program's ability to manage shortfalls.   Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP).  The Administration urges the House to fund CSFP at the FY 2013 Budget request.  The Committee bill level could result in as many as 55,000 participants \u2013 the majority of whom are vulnerable seniors \u2013 losing eligibility.  CSFP provides a supplementary food package with the nutrients typically lacking in the diets of its target population.   International Food Aid.  The Administration strongly opposes the $250 million reduction in funding from the FY 2013 Budget request for Food for Peace Title II international food aid.  The funding level would severely reduce the United States' ability to respond to food crises abroad and to make investments that both save lives and help prevent future crises.  Title II programs help to stabilize conditions for vulnerable groups in the face of drought, conflict, and other shocks.   Clean and Renewable Energy.  The Administration urges the House to include the proposal in the FY 2013 Budget that moves the Rural Electric Loan Program away from fossil fuels and encourages the construction, acquisition, or improvement of renewable energy plants in rural America.  Service Center Salaries and Expenses.  The Administration urges the House to restore funding for USDA's Service Center Agencies (Farm Service Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and Rural Development) to the level requested in the President's Budget.  Each of these agencies has seen significant decreases in its administrative budget since 2010, which they have met through permanent staffing reductions using voluntary early retirement and separation authorities, delaying or eliminating the acquisition of important information technologies upgrades, office closures, and reductions for most other administrative expenses.  An additional three percent reduction could harm program delivery, delay rural economic development, and lead to longer waits for farm and home loans as well as assistance for farmers and ranchers.  2  Building Operations and Maintenance (O&M).  The Administration opposes the elimination of funding for the building O&M portion of the Agriculture Buildings and Facilities account, and the 35 percent reduction for the departmental administration staff offices, a $55 million and $9 million reduction, respectively, from the FY 2013 Budget request.  Consistent with the Administration's efforts to reduce administrative costs, the Department is streamlining services and cutting expenses by closing unnecessary offices, reducing travel and printing, and consolidating information technology contracts.  The Committee proposal to eliminate O&M funding entirely and the deep cut in the USDA-wide staff offices would put an unrealistic burden on agencies.    Program Cuts, Consolidations, and Savings.  The Administration urges the House to accept additional cuts, consolidations, and savings proposed in the FY 2013 Budget for USDA, including an estimated $75 million in savings from blocking spending of the Good Performance Rebate and $15 million in savings from termination of the Watershed Rehabilitation Program.   Department of Health and Human Services  Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Administration strongly supports robust funding for FDA to continue implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act, improve oversight of imports, and invest in the development of medical products, including medical countermeasures.  The Administration requested $4.5 billion in total resources for FDA and the bill provides $3.8 billion, does not include new proposed user fees, and rescinds previous appropriations.  The Administration urges the House to adopt the new user fees proposed in the FY 2013 Budget and restore FDA's budget authority.  These new user fees, targeted in areas where the industry derives a direct benefit from FDA's regulatory oversight, provide additional resources that are essential to support FDA's critical mission to make food and medical products safer, and increase access to safe and effective generic drugs and biologics.  The reductions in budget authority also jeopardize FDA's ability to complete its Life Sciences/Biodefense laboratory, an integral part of FDA's regulatory science capacity that will support national and global preparedness for annual and pandemic influenza and other emerging threats.   Other Independent Agencies Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The Administration strongly opposes the $128 million reduction in funding from the FY 2013 Budget request for CFTC.  Moreover, the $25 million cut from the FY 2012 enacted level would result in furloughs across the Agency, and would also severely undermine CFTC's ability to carry out its market oversight and enforcement functions.  The funding level would significantly curtail the Administration's priority of timely, effective implementation of Wall Street Reform, which includes CFTC's new responsibilities to regulate the $300 trillion swaps market.  Reducing CFTC's capacity to effectively police the futures and swaps marketplaces would imperil investors' funds and pose a threat to U.S. financial stability.  In addition, the Administration urges the Congress to consider the Budget proposal to implement a CFTC user fee, which would fully offset the FY 2013 Budget request for CFTC.  CFTC is the only Federal financial regulator not funded in whole or in part through fees paid by its regulated community.   3  Riders  The Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders that have no place in funding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill:  GIPSA Marketing Rule.  Section 719 of the bill effectively prevents USDA's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration from further implementing the remaining portions of a rule on conduct violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.  The provision's proposal to rescind many components of the rule that was finalized in December 2011, would prevent full implementation of this rule, which is needed to clarify conditions for industry compliance with the Packers and Stockyards Act and provide for a fairer marketplace.   Changes to the WIC Food Benefit.  Section 743 would prohibit the exclusion of certain foods from the WIC food package, which undermines the science-based approach used in the program.  WIC provides supplemental foods that nutrition research has found to be critical for healthy child development that are otherwise lacking in the diets of pregnant women, infants, and children.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *   4  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5855, making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.    Last summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  The BCA created a framework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that would bring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national priorities.  Departing from the bipartisan agreement reached in the BCA and departing from these caps, the House of Representatives put forward a topline discretionary funding level for FY 2013 that, for example, would cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially seniors, veterans, and children \u2013 as well as degrade many of the basic Government services on which the American people rely such as air traffic control and law enforcement.  In addition, these cuts were made in the context of a budget that fails the test of balance, fairness, and shared responsibility by giving millionaires and billionaires a tax cut and paying for it through deep cuts, including to discretionary programs.  Taking this into account, passing H.R. 5855 at its current funding level would mean that when the Congress constructs other appropriations bills, it would necessitate significant and harmful cuts to critical national priorities such as education, research and development, job training, and health care.  Furthermore, the bill undermines key investments in homeland security, including cuts to aviation security activities, reductions to critical grant programs, and elimination of key consolidation efforts to improve operations across Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enterprise operations.  Investing in these areas is critical to the Nation's economic growth, security, and global competitiveness.  The Administration also strongly objects to the inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.   If the President were presented with H.R. 5855, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Transportation Security Administration.  The Administration objects to the bill's failure to reform the aviation passenger security fee as proposed in the FY 2013 Budget.  The Administration is also concerned that funding for the Federal Air Marshals is cut by $50 million below the FY 2013 Budget request, which will result in reduced coverage on high-risk flights.  State and Local Grant Programs.  The Administration objects to the Committee's failure to include the proposed National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP).  NPGP is designed to develop, sustain, and leverage core capabilities across the United States in support of national  preparedness, prevention, and response.  The Administration appreciates that the bill continues the flexibility provided to the Secretary of Homeland Security to award grants, as authorized in FY 2012.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  The Administration opposes the Committee's decision to fund 1,200 unrequested detention beds while reducing funds requested for ICE's Alternatives to Detention program, which helps ensure that low-risk individuals in removal proceedings appear for hearings and comply with removal orders, all at a lower per-day cost than detention.  The Administration objects to the funding provided above the FY 2013 Budget request for the 287(g) program, since Secure Communities is more consistent, efficient, and cost-effective in identifying and removing criminal and other priority aliens than the 287(g) program.  The Administration also objects to a statutory funding floor for worksite enforcement, which would limit ICE's ability to address emerging criminal trends and prevent ICE from reallocating investigatory resources based on threat and risk.  Departmental Management Initiatives.  The Administration opposes the lack of funding for two key management initiatives at DHS: continued investments for the St. Elizabeths Headquarters Consolidation project; and funding for DHS Data Center Consolidation.  Both of these initiatives are necessary to strengthen DHS operations and increase efficiency in future years.  Cybersecurity.  The Administration appreciates the support the bill provides for cybersecurity initiatives including the EINSTEIN program and a new initiative to continuously monitor Federal networks for malicious cyber activity.  Incremental Funding.  The Administration opposes the use of incremental funding for the Coast Guard's National Security Cutter program.  Although the Administration supports the underlying shipbuilding programs, the use of incremental funding rather than the full funding requested for FY 2013 undermines program stability and long-term cost discipline.  Transfer of US-VISIT.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not include the Administration's proposal to transfer portions of the US-VISIT program to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  Currently CBP operates numerous screening and targeting systems, and integrating US-VISIT activities within CBP would strengthen the Department's overall vetting capability while also realizing efficiencies and savings.  The bill instead places US-VISIT within the National Protection and Programs Directorate without achieving operational efficiencies or cost savings, hampering the Department's efforts to improve program effectiveness.  Disaster Relief Fund.  The Administration appreciates the funding level provided in the bill for the Disaster Relief Fund, including $608 million for base program activity and $5.5 billion provided as a disaster relief cap adjustment made pursuant to the BCA.  This funding should be sufficient to support the Nation's response to emergencies and major disasters and to provide ongoing aid to disaster survivors. Immigrant Integration Grants.  The Administration appreciates the $9.2 million in fee-based funding provided to administer the citizenship and immigrant integration grant program at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and encourages the Congress to fund these efforts through discretionary appropriations, as requested in the FY 2013 Budget.       Civilian Pay Freeze.  The Administration objects to efforts to reduce pay for civilian personnel that would effectively extend the freeze on civilian pay through FY 2013.  As the President 2  stated in his FY 2013 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.  The Administration encourages the Congress to support the proposed 0.5 percent pay raise.  Facilitating Trade and Travel.  The Administration underscores its concern that the bill does not include the Administration's proposal for additional authority for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to enter into public-private partnerships, which would enable CBP to expand and expedite the throughput of travelers and cargo to and from the United States.  The Administration proposed this authority to provide additional flexibility for augmenting safe and secure processing capacity to increase travel and trade to the United States.  Riders  The Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders that have no place in funding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill:  Abortion-Related Provisions.  Sections 566, 567, and 568 purport to limit the use of Federal funds for providing or facilitating abortion services.  Longstanding Federal policy prohibits Federal funds from being used for these services, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  Current DHS practice does not compel employees to perform or facilitate them, or permit Federal funds to be used to acquire these services except in cases where a pregnancy is the result of rape, incest, or threatens the life of the woman.   Constitutional Concerns   The Administration strongly objects to and has constitutional concerns about the provisions of section 533 that limit the use of funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee transfers.  Although the Administration opposes the release of detainees within the United States, section 533 undermines our national security and raises significant separation of powers concerns.  This provision unnecessarily constrains the Nation's counterterrorism efforts, particularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 option for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have leveraged the flexibility and strength of this country\u2019s Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous terrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The continued prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an essential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available option.  Such restrictions or interferences would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.    Additionally, Section 512 purports to prevent funds from being used to exercise supervisory control over preparation of certain reports by the Privacy Officer of the Department of Homeland Security.  This provision implicates separation of powers concerns by imposing a potentially material practical burden on the President's effective supervision and management of the Executive Branch.  The Administration urges that it be deleted.  Finally, Sections 547 and 550 both raise concerns under the Recommendations Clause, because they purport to constrain the substance of the President's or other executive officers' budget proposals. The Administration also urges that these provisions be deleted.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * * 3  ", "The Administration recognizes that S. 1931 would at least continue this year's payroll tax cut.  However, the Administration opposes S. 1931 because, by contrast to S. 1944, it provides one-third less tax relief for America's workers and is paid for by unbalanced cuts that would break a bipartisan deal achieved in August and would undermine the Nation's ability to invest in areas that are key to America's future, to maintain core government functions, and to defend the United States.      If the Congress does nothing, the typical working family earning $50,000 will see its taxes go up by $1,000.  Under the American Jobs Act and S. 1944, that family's tax cut would be increased from $1,000 to $1,500.  By contrast, S. 1931 does not expand the current payroll tax cut at all, thus providing one-third less tax relief to 160 million American workers.    While S. 1944 proposes to fully pay for the tax cuts in a balanced and fair way, S. 1931 would almost entirely pay for the payroll tax cuts by breaking the bipartisan deal achieved in the Budget Control Act.  It would add new cuts on top of the $1 trillion in reductions to defense and non-defense spending under the Budget Control Act and the additional $1.2 trillion in cuts that could automatically go into place because of the failure of the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction.  The additional spending cuts under S. 1931 would mean further reductions in areas like education and energy, reducing core government functions ranging from services for this Nation's veterans to border security, and further cutting back spending on the Nation's defense.   The President is committed to providing tax relief to America's workers next year and fully paying for this relief in a way that is fair.  The Administration strongly supports S. 1944 and opposes S. 1931.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports the enactment of S. 990, which reauthorizes through June 1, 2015, three critical authorities that our Nation's intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to protect our national security.  These authorities, which expire after May 26, 2011 absent extension, are:  (1) section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority for roving surveillance of targets who take steps that may thwart Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) surveillance; (2) section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority to compel production of business records and other tangible things with the approval of the FISA court; and (3) section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which provides authority under FISA to target non-U.S. persons who engage in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor, but are not necessarily associated with an identified terrorist group (the so-called \"lone wolf\" provision).  The Administration urges the Congress to act immediately to avoid any hiatus in these critical authorities needed to protect our national security.  * * * * * * *       ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 6020, making appropriations for financial services and general government for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.   Last summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).

In addition to the concern outlined above, the Administration strongly opposes the bill as reported by the Committee.  The bill severely undermines key investments in financial oversight and implementation of Wall Street reform to protect American consumers, as well as needed tax enforcement and taxpayer services.  It also hampers effective implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  Investing in these areas is critical to the Nation's economic growth, security, and global competitiveness.

If the President were presented with H.R. 6020, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The Administration strongly opposes the bill's reduction in funding from the FY 2013 Budget request for the IRS.  Freezing funding at FY 2012 levels would continue to erode IRS program performance, significantly reduce revenue, and impair taxpayers' ability to access  IRS services.  The Administration also urges the Congress to adopt the FY 2013 Budget's program integrity cap adjustment proposal, to provide additional funding to support high-return activities critical to the Nation's fiscal stability, yielding revenue that is many times larger than the investment.    Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) \u2013 Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI) and Bond Guarantee Program.  The Administration strongly urges the House to support key CDFI priorities such as HFFI, which is designed to increase the availability of affordable, healthy food outlets in underserved urban and rural communities, and the authorized Bond Guarantee Program, which would expand economic development and opportunity in low-income and disadvantaged areas.   Fiscal Service.  The Administration urges the House to provide a single appropriation for Fiscal Service rather than the Committee's proposal to provide separate funding for the Bureau of the Public Debt and the Financial Management Service.  A single account would enhance the organizational consolidation that is currently underway to streamline Federal financial management processes while improving efficiency and performance.   Other Defense Civil Programs  Selective Service System.  The Administration objects to the 50-percent reduction from the FY 2013 Budget request for the Selective Service System.  This reduction would make it difficult to maintain a viable registration system, which has both military and symbolic significance, and would require a Reduction-In-Force (RIF).    Executive Office of the President (EOP)  EOP Funding.  The $23 million reduction from the FY 2013 Budget request in the bill would significantly impact the EOP's responsibilities to assist the President in carrying out his constitutional duties as head of the Executive Branch, including protecting national security interests, developing policies to address the challenges facing the Nation, and providing effective coordination and oversight of Federal agencies.    Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  The Administration strongly objects to the bill's funding level for OMB, which represents a ten-percent reduction from the FY 2012 enacted level and is $11 million reduction below the FY 2013 Budget request. Absorbing reductions of this magnitude would require OMB to eliminate approximately 90 full time equivalents (FTEs) a staffing reduction of over 17 percent. This reduction would severely impact OMB's ability to carry out responsibilities that ensure sound use of taxpayer dollars, reduce low-priority spending to live within our fiscal constraints, and improve Government management.   General Services Administration (GSA)  Federal Buildings Fund.  The Administration urges the House to provide the FY 2013 Budget request for the Federal Buildings Fund.  By providing $702 million less than the FY 2013 Budget request, the bill fails to fund repair and alteration projects with exigent needs including fire and life safety repairs, and underfunds GSA's minor repair and alterations allocation, which is needed to meet minimal building repair requirements.  The Committee's funding level for the Federal Buildings Fund's operating activities jeopardizes GSA's ability to pay private lessors, utilities, and janitorial services.  2   Small Business Administration  Disaster Loan Program.  The Administration urges the House to provide the FY 2013 Budget request of $167 million for the Disaster Loan program's administrative costs through the authorized disaster cap adjustment under the BCA.    Other Independent Agencies  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Administration strongly opposes total resources included in the bill for SEC, which is $245 million below the FY 2013 Budget request, including a provision preventing obligation of funds from the Commission's non-appropriated Reserve Fund.  Taken together with onerous mandated increases in information technology funding in excess of amounts requested, the bill would require SEC to reduce staff policing U.S. securities markets and enforcing Federal securities laws, threatening the stability of our markets and the health of our economy.   Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The Administration appreciates that the bill allows FCC increased access to spectrum auction receipts to conduct auctions, enabling FCC to implement the spectrum auctions recently authorized by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act in a manner that best serves taxpayers.  However, the bill also reduces regular appropriated funding for FCC to $323 million.  Funding for FCC is budget neutral and without the proper amount of resources the agency would find it increasingly difficult to manage its responsibilities, such as supporting the build-out of public safety communications networks, overseeing mergers and spectrum transactions, and reforming the Universal Service Fund.  Election Assistance Commission (EAC).  The Administration urges the House to fund EAC at the requested level of $11.5 million to maintain the Commission's ability to fulfill its statutorily required duties and protect the integrity of elections.  The Committee's funding level could require EAC to RIF half of its current employees.   Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS).  The Administration opposes the Committee's decision not to include funding for ACUS, which would deprive taxpayers of the substantial cost savings that result from ACUS's recommendations.    Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.  The Administration opposes the Committee's decision to not include funding for the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.  Without funding in FY 2013, the Board would be unable to begin operations and execute its statutory responsibilities to assist agencies in ensuring that policies and activities properly protect U.S. citizens' privacy and civil liberties.   District of Columbia.  The Administration urges the House to include the provision requested in the FY 2013 Budget that allows the District of Columbia to spend its own local funds collected through local taxes and other non-Federal sources in the event of a lapse in Federal appropriations.  As is true for States, vital District operations that rely solely on non-Federal funds should not be disrupted by inaction of the Federal Government.    3  Civilian Pay Freeze  The Administration objects to the exclusion of a provision providing for a Government-wide civilian pay adjustment for calendar year 2013.  As the President stated in his FY 2013 Budget request, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.  The Administration encourages the Congress to support the proposed 0.5 percent pay raise for civilian employees, while continuing the pay freeze for senior political officials.  The Administration also urges the inclusion of a provision relating to pay adjustments for prevailing rate employees.  Riders  The Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders that have no place in funding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill:  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Funding Restrictions.  Sections 501 and 502 would terminate Federal Reserve transfers to fund CFPB and subject the agency to the annual appropriations process beginning in FY 2014.  The provision would shred the necessary independence of CFPB set in statute, and would increase the likelihood of underfunding CFPB, reducing consumer protection in the financial services marketplace.    Internal Revenue Service Affordable Care Act.  Section 106 would impair the IRS' ability to implement the tax laws, specifically those enacted in ACA, by restricting the use of certain funding sources.  This restriction would pose unnecessary risks to proper implementation of the Nation's laws.  District of Columbia Needle Exchange Restriction.  Section 807 restricts the use of Federal funds for the District's needle exchange programs.  This is contrary to current law and the Administration's policy to allow funds to be used in locations where local authorities deem needle exchange programs to be effective and appropriate.   District of Columbia Abortion Restriction.  Section 810 prevents the District of Columbia from using its own funds for abortions, which undermines the principle of States' rights and of District home rule.  Longstanding Federal policy already prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.    Reporting Requirements Related to Wall Street Reform Implementation.  Sections 120, 203, and 503 place additional reporting requirements on the Office of Financial Research, OMB, and CFPB, respectively, that are duplicative of existing reporting requirements and costly to produce.    Abortion Coverage Under Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Programs.  Section 613 would expand current prohibitions on funding for abortion services and related administrative expenses by the Federal Employee Health Benefits programs health insurance carriers to all carriers under OPM's purview.  Longstanding Federal policy prohibits funds from being used for abortion services, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered. However, this expansion could implicate the Multi-State plans (MSPs) administered by OPM under ACA, and preclude OPM from spending any funds appropriated by this Act for MSPs that cover abortion services under segregated funding requirements that are structured to ensure no Federal funds are used for abortion except in the cases listed above.  This expansion is not necessary to protect Federal funds and restricts 4  private insurance choices.  Sequestration Reporting.  Sections 205 and 206 include requirements for OMB to report on the impact of sequestration.  The Administration urges the Congress to focus on bipartisan, balanced deficit reduction legislation to avoid sequestration.  Should the Congress fail to act, the Administration will be prepared to implement the sequester.   Constitutional Concerns   Multiple provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  Section 204 would prohibit the use of funds for officers or employees of the Executive Office of the President \"to prepare, sign, or approve statements abrogating legislation passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate and signed by the President.\"  Contrary to the implication of section 204, presidential signing statements do not abrogate legislation.  They indicate how the Executive Branch will apply acts of the Congress to ensure faithful execution of the laws.  To the extent section 204 purports to prevent the President from making use of his immediate aides in the Executive Office of the President to prepare any statement articulating the conclusion that a particular provision of law is unconstitutional and therefore will not be executed, in whole or in part, this provision would impermissibly encroach upon the President's constitutional authority to execute and interpret Federal laws, including the Constitution.  Section 622 would prohibit the use of funds for several positions that involve providing advice directly to the President and any \"substantially similar positions.\"  The President has well-established authority to supervise and oversee the Executive Branch, and to obtain advice in furtherance of this supervisory authority.  The President also has the prerogative to obtain advice that will assist him in carrying out his constitutional responsibilities, and do so not only from Executive Branch officials and employees outside the White House, but also from advisors within it.  Finally, sections 713 and 715 are phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch to disclose, without discretion, certain classified and other privileged information, in which case they would intrude on the President's discharge of his constitutional authorities.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  5  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3 because it:  intrudes on women's reproductive freedom and access to health care; increases the tax burden on many Americans; unnecessarily restricts the private insurance choices that consumers have today; and restricts the District of Columbia\u2019s use of local funds, which undermines home rule.  Longstanding Federal policy prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  This prohibition is maintained in the Affordable Care Act and reinforced through the President\u2019s Executive Order 13535.  H.R. 3 goes well beyond these safeguards by interfering with consumers\u2019 private health care choices.  The Administration also strongly supports existing provider conscience laws that have protected the rights of health care providers and entities for over 30 years, and it recognizes and supports the rights of patients.  The Administration will strongly oppose legislation that unnecessarily restricts women\u2019s reproductive freedoms and consumers\u2019 private insurance options.  If the President is presented with H.R. 3, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5972, making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.  Last summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  The BCA created a framework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that would bring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national priorities.  Departing from the bipartisan agreement reached in the BCA and departing from these caps, the House of Representatives put forward a topline discretionary funding level for FY 2013 that, for example, would cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially seniors, veterans, and children \u2013 as well as degrade many of the basic Government services on which the American people rely, such as air traffic control and law enforcement.  In addition, these cuts were made in the context of a budget that fails the test of balance, fairness, and shared responsibility by giving millionaires and billionaires a tax cut and paying for it through deep cuts, including to discretionary programs.  Taking this into account, passing H.R. 5972 at its current funding level would mean that when the Congress constructs other appropriations bills, it would necessitate significant and harmful cuts to critical national priorities, such as education, research and development, job training, and health care.  Furthermore, the bill undermines key investments in economic and community development programs that drive local innovations, while also weakening the safety net for Americans facing significant hardship in these challenging economic times.  The Administration also strongly objects to the inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.   If the President were presented with H.R. 5972, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Transportation (DOT)  The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to produce a long-term surface transportation reauthorization bill devoid of controversial policy riders, to put Americans to work  building the Nation's roads, bridges, railways, and transit systems.    TIGER Grants.  The Administration is disappointed with the lack of funding for TIGER Grants and urges the House to provide $500 million for the TIGER program, as requested in the FY 2013 Budget.  The program relies on a competitive, merit-based approach to help communities build innovative, multi-modal transportation projects \u2013 often with substantial State and local co-investment.   Intercity Passenger Rail.  While the Administration appreciates the robust funding level for Amtrak, the Administration strongly objects to the bill's failure to provide additional funding for High Speed Rail grants, which would help continue progress toward developing new and improved rail services for the Nation's most congested metropolitan regions.   Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Choice Neighborhoods.  The Administration strongly objects to the bill's failure to fund the FY 2013 Budget request of $150 million for Choice Neighborhoods.  Absent this funding, public housing authorities and other local entities would have no resources to support the revitalization of distressed HUD-assisted housing or improve economic development and job opportunities in the surrounding neighborhoods for low-income families.  Sustainable Communities.  The Administration strongly objects to the bill's failure to fund the FY 2013 Budget request of $100 million for Sustainable Communities.  This competitive grant program supports an interagency effort between HUD, DOT, and the Environmental Protection Agency that integrates Federal, State, and local investment activities in housing, land use, economic and workforce development, and transportation.  At a time of budget constraints, it is critical that support for regional and local planning is available to help localities invest limited resources strategically to achieve the greatest short and long-term benefit for citizens.    Homeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration urges the House to provide the FY 2013 Budget request for Homeless Assistance Grants, which fund a variety of intervention programs that serve homeless and at-risk individuals and families.  The Committee provides $2 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, which is $231 million below the FY 2013 Budget request.  At this level, HUD would be unable to fund all renewals of existing grants, jeopardizing assistance to approximately 25,000 people.  Rental and Other Assistance.  The Administration urges the House to adopt rental assistance proposals along the lines in the FY 2013 Budget that would yield savings across HUD rental assistance programs.  At present, the funding level in the bill for Housing Choice Vouchers, Project-Based Rental Assistance, and Public Housing would result in about 30,000 families losing their assistance.  In addition, the Administration urges the House to fund the Jobs-Plus pilot program at the $50 million requested in the FY 2013 Budget.  This is an evidence-based proposal proven to improve employment outcomes for public housing residents and help lift them toward self-sufficiency.   Housing Counseling.  The Administration urges the House to provide the requested funding for HUD's Housing Counseling program and for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation's National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program.  These funds provide much needed counseling assistance to families facing foreclosure and others that are struggling to find or maintain adequate housing.  2  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the CDBG program, which provides critical funding to State and local governments to address infrastructure, affordable housing, and economic development needs in their communities.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *    3  ", "The Administration strongly opposes legislation that attempts to erode the important provisions of the Affordable Care Act.  Additionally, the Administration has serious concerns with key aspects of medical malpractice provisions included in H.R. 5.  The goals of medical malpractice reform should be to provide fair and prompt compensation to patients who have been harmed by medical negligence, reduce preventable injuries, improve the quality of care, reduce defensive medicine, and lower medical liability premiums.  However, H.R. 5 would establish inappropriate and harmful restrictions on health care lawsuits without effectively meeting these goals.  Specifically, the Administration opposes placing artificial caps on malpractice awards which will prevent patients and other claimants who have been wrongfully harmed from receiving just compensation.    The Administration is committed to strengthening Medicare, protecting patients, and supporting the physicians who care for them.  We believe that this legislation fails to accomplish these goals.  If the President is presented with H.R. 5, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1249 as modified by the Manager\u2019s Amendment, but final legislative action must ensure that fee collections fully support the Nation\u2019s patent and trademark system.  The bill\u2019s much-needed reforms to the Nation\u2019s patent system will speed deployment of innovative products to market and promote job creation, economic growth, and U.S. economic competitiveness \u2013 all at no cost to American taxpayers.  The bill represents a balanced and well-crafted effort to enhance the services to patent applicants and America\u2019s innovators provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  It does so by supporting the USPTO\u2019s efforts to improve patent quality and reduce the backlog of patent applications, reducing domestic and global patenting costs for U.S. companies, providing greater certainty with respect to patent rights, and offering effective administrative alternatives to costly and complex litigation.   By adopting a first-inventor-to-file system, the bill simplifies the process of acquiring intellectual property rights.  This provision provides greater certainty for innovators, reduces legal costs that often burden small businesses and independent inventors, and makes it easier for innovators to market their inventions in the global marketplace.  This legislation also provides authority for the USPTO to establish and adjust its fees to reflect the actual costs of the services it provides. In addition, the Manager's Amendment provides important authority for a 15 percent surcharge on patent fees and additional fees for \"fast-track\" patent applications, which will enable the USPTO to reduce the backlog.  Finally, to increase the quality and certainty of patent rights and offer cost-effective, timely alternatives to district court litigation, the Administration also supports provisions in the legislation that would enhance the opportunities for post-grant review of patents by the USPTO.    To carry out the new mandates of the legislation and reduce delays in the patent application process, the USPTO must be able to use all the fees it collects to serve the users who pay those fees.  In this light, the Administration is concerned that Section 22 of the Manager's Amendment to H.R. 1249 does not by itself ensure such access.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to provide additional direction that makes clear that the USPTO will have timely access to all of the fees collected, subject to the congressional oversight provisions in the bill.     House passage of H.R. 1249 would foster innovation, improve economic competitiveness, and create jobs at no expense to taxpayers \u2013 all of which are key Administration goals. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to finalize this important bipartisan legislation and ensure that the USPTO can effectively accomplish its mission to support America\u2019s innovators.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration appreciates the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's support of the work and efforts of the Intelligence Community (IC) and supports many provisions contained in H.R. 754.  However, the Administration has a number of concerns with the bill, which are highlighted below, and looks forward to working with the Congress to address them.    The Administration strongly urges the Congress to reverse the reduction and realignment of resources (including to personnel levels) proposed in the Classified Annex and the Classified Schedule of Authorizations to the bill and requests that the Congress authorize all funding as appropriated, as well as all requested personnel levels.  The directed reductions and redirection of resources at this late point in the fiscal year would effectively make unavailable over $200 million of already appropriated funds for critical intelligence capabilities.     \u2022  First, cuts to requested funding and personnel levels will have a seriously negative effect on essential IC national security operations, including counter-terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction analysis and counterintelligence \u2013 all critical, high priority needs.  The reductions would result in less capability than exists today.  The Administration opposes the reductions in personnel levels below what was funded in the FY 2011 Appropriations Act and urges the Congress to authorize those funds as appropriated.    \u2022  Second, significant redirection of funds below the funding level enacted in the FY 2011 Appropriations Act from a technical collection program will negatively impact an acquisition that is successfully achieving acquisition milestones.  This action comes at a time when the IC is conducting a Congressionally-requested assessment of an alternative to the Administration\u2019s program.  Until that assessment is complete, a significant reduction or redirection of funds is unwarranted and will likely jeopardize the scheduled operational capability of this critical national security collection system.  Additional details are set out in a classified views letter from the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to the intelligence oversight committees, dated 12 April 2011.    Section 402 requires the DNI to create an insider threat detection program for the information resources of each element of the IC to detect unauthorized access to classified information.  The Administration wholeheartedly agrees with the need to be vigilant and proactive in trying to detect, mitigate, and deter insider threats, and supports a comprehensive insider threat detection capability.  The Administration is currently working toward its implementation.  However, the Administration is concerned with the unrealistic timelines required by this provision for the program\u2019s operational readiness, and strongly requests that the provision be amended to grant the DNI flexibility in implementation timelines of the program.   The Administration urges the inclusion with certain modifications of Section 412, which would help facilitate the auditability of Defense intelligence agencies by providing the Secretary of Defense with additional transfer authority for appropriations.  Deletion of this section will impede the IC\u2019s ability to meet the Congressionally-mandated goal of auditable financial statements.  * * * * * * *     2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4348.  The Administration is committed to working on a bipartisan basis on a comprehensive surface transportation reauthorization bill.  The reauthorization of the programs funded by the Highway Trust Fund is critical to the safety of the traveling public and the Nation\u2019s ability to facilitate commerce and trade. Since the expiration of the last multi-year authorization bill in 2009, surface transportation and highway safety programs have operated under a series of short-term extensions, varying from one to nine months.   By simply extending current authority through the end of the fiscal year, this legislation would miss a critical opportunity to provide more certainty to States and localities as they undertake the long-term planning and execution of projects and programs that are essential to creating and keeping American workers in good paying jobs, improving the Nation\u2019s surface transportation infrastructure, and ensuring roadway safety.  Further, the Administration is strongly opposed to this bill because it seeks to circumvent a longstanding and proven process for determining whether cross-border pipelines are in the national interest and for assessing the environmental impacts by mandating the permitting of the Keystone XL pipeline project, despite the fact that the pipeline route has yet to be identified and there is no complete assessment of its potential impacts, including impacts on health and safety, the economy, foreign policy, energy security, and the environment.  The Administration continues to support dedicating a significant amount of the Clean Water Act civil penalties resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill for Gulf Coast recovery in a manner that best serves the people and environment of the Gulf Coast.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve this goal.  Because this bill circumvents a longstanding and proven process for determining whether cross-border pipelines are in the national interest by mandating the permitting of the Keystone XL pipeline before a new route has been submitted and assessed, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend that he veto this legislation.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1837, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act because the bill would unravel decades of work to forge consensus, solutions, and settlements that equitably address some of California's most complex water challenges. H.R. 1837 would undermine five years of collaboration between local, State, and Federal stakeholders to develop the Bay-Delta Conservation Plan.  It would codify 20-year old, outdated science as the basis for managing California's water resources, resulting in inequitable treatment of one group of water users over another.  And, contrary to 100 years of reclamation law that exhibits congressional deference to State water law, the bill would preempt California water law. The bill also would reject the long-standing principle that beneficiaries should pay both the cost of developing water supplies and of mitigating any resulting development impacts, and would exacerbate current water shortages by repealing water pricing reforms that provide incentives for contractors to conserve water supplies. Finally, H.R. 1837 would repeal the San Joaquin River Settlement Agreement, which the Congress enacted to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation.  Repeal of the settlement agreement would likely result in the resumption of costly litigation, creating an uncertain future for river restoration and water delivery operations for all water users on the San Joaquin River. The Administration strongly supports efforts to provide a more reliable water supply for California and to protect, restore, and enhance the overall quality of the Bay-Delta environment.  The Administration has taken great strides toward achieving these co-equal goals through a coordinated Federal Action Plan, which has strengthened collaboration between Federal agencies and the State of California while achieving solid results.  Unfortunately, H.R. 1837 would undermine these efforts and the progress that has been made.  For this reason, were the Congress to pass H.R. 1837, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 2578, which is an omnibus lands bill incorporating fourteen separate House bills.  The Administration has worked to protect and manage the responsible use of America's natural resources and to support and ensure that the Nation's spectacular landscapes, unique natural life, and cultural resources and icons endure for future generations.  The Administration is working, through balanced and community-based decision-making, to maximize the benefits of the outdoors for all Americans.  The Department of the Interior advises that hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation alone contribute an estimated $730 billion to the economy each year.  Enactment of H.R. 2578 in its current form would not advance, and in many cases would set back, these priorities.  Overall, H.R. 2578 contains a number of provisions that would undermine the responsible balance of interests and considerations in the stewardship of the Nation's lands and natural resources.  Further, various provisions would disregard and shortchange public input on a range of community interests, including natural resource protections, and preclude agencies from considering less environmentally detrimental alternatives.  Most significantly, H.R. 2578 would:  (1) undermine recent months of productive talks on a revised proposal to satisfy Alaska Native land claims and consider the natural resource and other values of timberland in Alaska's Tongass National Forest; (2) reverse course on the science-based National Park Service plan, developed after a lengthy public engagement process, that provides an appropriate balance of off-road vehicle access and protection of sensitive seashore areas in North Carolina; (3) weaken important National Environmental Policy Act and public involvement provisions for actions affecting resources such as grazing on lands managed by the Department of the Interior; and (4) thwart successful efforts by agencies to collaborate on border security while protecting our natural and cultural resources on Federal lands along U.S. borders by waiving thirty-seven environmental and administrative laws.  All of these provisions present a false choice between natural resources protection and the economy or national security.  The Administration recognizes that portions of this multi-title legislation are noncontroversial; a few are unworkable as drafted, but many could be amended to address concerns, including those outlined in Executive branch testimonies delivered in congressional hearings over the past number of months.  Thus, the Administration urges the Congress to address these identified policy, programmatic, and management concerns, and looks forward to working with the Congress on them.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 2204, which would repeal $21 billion in special tax breaks for oil and gas companies over 10 years.  The Nation\u2019s outdated tax laws currently provide the oil and gas industry billions of dollars per year in these subsidies, even though the industry is reporting outsized profits.  Furthermore, heads of the major oil companies have in the past made it clear that high oil prices provide more than enough profit motive to invest in domestic exploration and production without special tax breaks.  In making the tough choices necessary for deficit reduction, the Nation simply cannot afford these wasteful subsidies, and that is why the President has proposed to eliminate them in his past three budgets as well as in his framework for business tax reform.  This money can be better spent promoting domestic manufacturing, encouraging the development of clean energy technologies that will reduce our dependence on oil, and cutting the deficit.    In addition, S. 2204 is consistent with elements of the President\u2019s Budget such as the reauthorization of the section 48C advanced energy manufacturing credit and the extension of the section 1603 program.  Together, these important provisions support projects that will increase the Nation\u2019s production of domestic clean energy and encourage investment in factories that will manufacture cutting-edge energy technologies here in the United States.  There is no silver bullet when it comes to high gas prices, which is why the Administration has consistently advocated for an \u201call-of-the-above\u201d approach when it comes to the Nation\u2019s energy policy.  By ending taxpayer subsidies to large oil companies and investing part of that money in a clean energy industry that has never been more promising, S. 2204 is consistent with that approach.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 358 because, as previously stated in the Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 3, the legislation intrudes on women's reproductive freedom and access to health care and unnecessarily restricts the private insurance choices that women and their families have today.    Longstanding Federal policy prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  The Affordable Care Act preserved this prohibition and included policies to ensure that Federal funding is segregated from any private dollars used to fund abortions for which Federal funding is prohibited.  The President\u2019s Executive Order 13535 reinforces that Federal funding cannot be used for abortions (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered) and ensures proper enforcement of this policy.  H.R. 358 goes well beyond the safeguards found in current law and reinforced in the President\u2019s Executive Order by restricting women\u2019s private insurance choices.

The Administration is pleased that S. 1925 continues that bipartisan progress and targets resources to address today\u2019s most pressing issues.  Sexual assault remains one of the most underreported violent crimes in the country.  The bill provides funding through State grants to improve the criminal justice response to sexual assault and to better connect victims with services.  The bill also seeks to reduce domestic violence homicides and address the high rates of violence experienced by teens and young adults.  Reaching young people through early intervention can break the cycle of violence.    The Administration strongly supports measures in S. 1925 that will bring justice to Native American victims.  Rates of domestic violence against Native American women are now among the highest in the United States.  The bill builds on the Tribal Law and Order Act \u2013 which President Obama signed on July 29, 2010 \u2013 to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of tribal justice systems and will provide additional tools to tribal and Federal prosecutors to address domestic violence in Indian country.

The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee's continued support of our national defense, including its support for both the base budget and for overseas contingency operations and for most of the Administration's initiatives to control spiraling health costs of the Department of Defense (DoD).   The Administration appreciates the support of the Committee for authorities that assist the ability of the warfighter to operate in unconventional and irregular warfare, authorities that are important to field commanders, such as the Commanders' Emergency Response Program, Global Train and Equip Authority, and other programs that provide commanders with the resources and flexibility to counter unconventional threats or support contingency or stability operations.  The Administration looks forward to reviewing a classified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns on classified programs as the legislative process moves forward.   While there are many areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration would have serious concerns with provisions that would: (1) constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions; (2) impede the Secretary of Defense's ability to make and implement decisions that eliminate unnecessary overhead or programs to ensure scarce resources are directed to the highest priorities for the warfighter; or (3) depart from the decisions reflected in the President's FY 2012 Budget Request.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.   Detainee Matters:  The Administration objects to and has serious legal and policy concerns about many of the detainee provisions in the bill.  In their current form, some of these provisions disrupt the Executive branch's ability to enforce the law and impose unwise and unwarranted restrictions on the U.S. Government's ability to aggressively combat international terrorism; other provisions inject legal uncertainty and ambiguity that may only complicate the military's operations and detention practices.    Section 1031 attempts to expressly codify the detention authority that exists under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40) (the \u201cAUMF\u201d).  The authorities granted by the AUMF, including the detention authority, are essential to our ability to protect the American people from the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its associated forces, and have enabled us to confront the full range of threats this country faces from those organizations and individuals.  Because the authorities codified in this section already exist, the Administration does not believe codification is necessary and poses some risk.  After a decade of settled jurisprudence on detention authority, Congress must be careful not to open a whole new series of  legal questions that will distract from our efforts to protect the country.  While the current language minimizes many of those risks, future legislative action must ensure that the codification in statute of express military detention authority does not carry unintended consequences that could compromise our ability to protect the American people.   The Administration strongly objects to the military custody provision of section 1032, which would appear to mandate military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects.  This unnecessary, untested, and legally controversial restriction of the President's authority to defend the Nation from terrorist threats would tie the hands of our intelligence and law enforcement professionals.  Moreover, applying this military custody requirement to individuals inside the United States, as some Members of Congress have suggested is their intention, would raise serious and unsettled legal questions and would be inconsistent with the fundamental American principle that our military does not patrol our streets.  We have spent ten years since September 11, 2001, breaking down the walls between intelligence, military, and law enforcement professionals; Congress should not now rebuild those walls and unnecessarily make the job of preventing terrorist attacks more difficult.  Specifically, the provision would limit the flexibility of our national security professionals to choose, based on the evidence and the facts and circumstances of each case, which tool for incapacitating dangerous terrorists best serves our national security interests.  The waiver provision fails to address these concerns, particularly in time-sensitive operations in which law enforcement personnel have traditionally played the leading role.  These problems are all the more acute because the section defines the category of individuals who would be subject to mandatory military custody by substituting new and untested legislative criteria for the criteria the Executive and Judicial branches are currently using for detention under the AUMF in both habeas litigation and military operations.  Such confusion threatens our ability to act swiftly and decisively to capture, detain, and interrogate terrorism suspects, and could disrupt the collection of vital intelligence about threats to the American people.    Rather than fix the fundamental defects of section 1032 or remove it entirely, as the Administration and the chairs of several congressional committees with jurisdiction over these matters have advocated, the revised text merely directs the President to develop procedures to ensure the myriad problems that would result from such a requirement do not come to fruition.  Requiring the President to devise such procedures concedes the substantial risks created by mandating military custody, without providing an adequate solution.  As a result, it is likely that implementing such procedures would inject significant confusion into counterterrorism operations.    The certification and waiver, required by section 1033 before a detainee may be transferred from Guant\u00e1namo Bay to a foreign country, continue to hinder the Executive branch's ability to exercise its military, national security, and foreign relations activities.  While these provisions may be intended to be somewhat less restrictive than the analogous provisions in current law, they continue to pose unnecessary obstacles, effectively blocking transfers that would advance our national security interests, and would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  The Executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers.  Section 1034's ban on the use of funds to construct or modify a detention facility in the United States is an unwise intrusion on the military's ability to transfer its detainees as operational needs dictate.  Section 1035 conflicts with the consensus-based interagency approach to detainee reviews required under Executive Order No. 13567, which establishes procedures to ensure that 2  periodic review decisions are informed by the most comprehensive information and the considered views of all relevant agencies.  Section 1036, in addition to imposing onerous requirements, conflicts with procedures for detainee reviews in the field that have been developed based on many years of experience by military officers and the Department of Defense.   In short, the matters addressed in these provisions are already well regulated by existing procedures and have traditionally been left to the discretion of the Executive branch.     Broadly speaking, the detention provisions in this bill micromanage the work of our experienced counterterrorism professionals, including our military commanders, intelligence professionals, seasoned counterterrorism prosecutors, or other operatives in the field.  These professionals have successfully led a Government-wide effort to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qa'ida and its affiliates and adherents over two consecutive Administrations.  The Administration believes strongly that it would be a mistake for Congress to overrule or limit the tactical flexibility of our Nation's counterterrorism professionals.    Any bill that challenges or constrains the President's critical authorities to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, and protect the Nation would prompt the President's senior advisers to recommend a veto.    Joint Strike Fighter Aircraft (JSF):  The Administration also appreciates the Committee's inclusion in the bill of a prohibition on using funds authorized by S. 1867 to be used for the development of the F136 JSF alternate engine.  As the Administration has stated, continued development of the F136 engine is an unnecessary diversion of scarce resources.   Medium Extended Air Defense Systems (MEADS): The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Department's air and missile defense programs; however, it strongly objects to the lack of authorization of appropriations for continued development of the MEADS program.  This lack of authorization could trigger unilateral withdrawal by the United States from the MEADS Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Germany and Italy, which could further lead to a DoD obligation to pay all contract costs \u2013 a scenario that would likely exceed the cost of satisfying DoD's commitment under the MOU.  Further, this lack of authorization could also call into question DoD's ability to honor its financial commitments in other binding cooperative MOUs and have adverse consequences for other international cooperative programs.    Overseas Construction Funding for Guam and Bahrain:  The Administration has serious concerns with the limitation on execution of the United States and Government of Japan funds to implement the realignment of United States Marine Forces from Okinawa to Guam.  The bill would unnecessarily restrict the ability and flexibility of the President to execute our foreign and defense policies with our ally, Japan.  The Administration also has concerns over the lack of authorization of appropriations for military construction projects in Guam and Bahrain.  Deferring or eliminating these projects could send the unintended message that the United States does not stand by its allies or its agreements.    Provisions Authorizing Activities with Partner Nations:  The Administration appreciates the support of the Committee to improve capabilities of other nations to support counterterrorism efforts and other U.S. interests, and urges the inclusion of DoD's requested proposals, which balance U.S. national security and broader foreign policy interests.  The Administration would prefer only an annual extension of the support to foreign nation counter-drug activities authority in line with its request.  While the inclusion of section 1207 (Global Security Contingency Fund) 3  is welcome, several provisions may affect Executive branch agility in the implementation of this authority.  Section 1204 (relating to Yemen) would require a 60-day notify and wait period not only for Yemen, but for all other countries as well, which would impose an excessive delay and seriously impede the Executive branch's ability to respond to emerging requirements.   Unrequested Authorization Increases:  Although not the only examples in S. 1867, the Administration notes and objects to the addition of $240 million and $200 million, respectively, in unrequested authorization for unneeded upgrades to M-1 Abrams tanks and Rapid Innovation Program research and development in this fiscally constrained environment.  The Administration believes the amounts appropriated in FY 2011 and requested in FY 2012 fully fund DoD's requirements in these areas.   Advance Appropriations for Acquisition:  The Administration objects to section 131, which would provide only incremental funding \u2013 undermining stability and cost discipline \u2013 rather than the advance appropriations that the Administration requested for the procurement of Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites and certain classified programs.   Authority to Extend Deadline for Completion of a Limited Number of Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Recommendations:  The Administration requests inclusion of its proposed authority for the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense to extend the 2005 BRAC implementation deadline for up to ten (10) recommendations for a period of no more than one year in order to ensure no disruption to the full and complete implementation of each of these recommendations, as well as continuity of operations.  Section 2904 of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act imposes on DoD a legal obligation to close and realign all installations so recommended by the BRAC Commission to the President and to complete all such closures and realignments no later than September 15, 2011.  DoD has a handful of recommendations with schedules that complete implementation close to the statutory deadline.    TRICARE  Providers:   The  Administration  is  currently  undertaking  a  review  with  relevant agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Justice, to clarify the responsibility of health care providers under civil and workers' rights laws.  The Administration therefore objects to section 702, which categorically excludes TRICARE network providers from being considered subcontractors for purposes of the Federal Acquisition Regulation or any other law.     Troops to Teachers Program:  The Administration urges the Senate's support for the transfer of the Troops to Teachers Program to DoD in FY 2012, as reflected in the President's Budget and DoD's legislative proposal to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and Title 10 of the U.S. Code in lieu of section 1048. The move to Defense will help ensure that this important program supporting members of the military as teachers is retained and provide better oversight of 6 program outcomes by simplifying and streamlining program management. The Administration looks forward to keeping the Congress abreast of this transfer, to ensure it runs smoothly and has no adverse impact on program enrollees.  Constitutional concerns:  A number of the bill's provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, such as sections 233 and 1241, which could intrude on the President's constitutional authority to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive diplomatic communications.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.   * * * * * * * 4  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1076, which would unacceptably prohibit Federal funding of National Public Radio (NPR) and the use of Federal funds by public radio stations to acquire radio content.  As part of the President\u2019s commitment to cut spending, the President\u2019s Budget proposed targeted reductions in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which provides a small amount of funding for NPR, and the Administration has expressed openness to other spending reductions that are reasonable.  However, CPB serves an important public purpose in supporting public radio, television, and related online and mobile services.  The vast majority of CPB\u2019s funding for public radio goes to more than 700 stations across the country, many of them local stations serving communities that rely on them for access to news and public safety information. Undercutting funding for these radio stations, notably ones in rural areas where such outlets are already scarce, would result in communities losing valuable programming, and some stations could be forced to shut down altogether.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas production as part of a broad energy strategy that will protect consumers and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  Safety and environmental reforms that the Administration implemented in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill are critical to achieving those objectives.  These reforms strengthen requirements for issues ranging from well design to workplace safety to corporate accountability, and they require operators to show that they can contain a subsea oil spill like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The Administration opposes         H.R. 1230 and H.R. 1229, as reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources, both of which would undercut these critical reforms.   H.R. 1230 would undermine the Administration's work to ensure that environmental analysis required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is conducted in a rigorous manner.  H.R. 1230 would hastily open areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic to leasing, including requiring the Department of the Interior (DOI) to hold three lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico using outdated NEPA analysis that was conducted before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The Administration has strengthened NEPA analysis in light of lessons learned from the spill.  DOI intends to hold all three Gulf of Mexico lease sales referenced in the bill by mid-2012.      H.R. 1229 would constrain the ability of DOI to ensure that permits meet safety standards by requiring permitting decisions to be made within 30 days of receiving an application \u2013 thereby curtailing the review period.  Two 15 day extensions would be possible, though DOI would be required to submit burdensome justifications.  The bill would grant permits automatically at the end of this 60 day window, regardless of whether the applicant satisfied safety standards.  The Administration believes these statutory time constraints are unwarranted.  Fifty-one new shallow water permits have been issued since the Administration\u2019s stronger safety standards were put in place, and deepwater permit applications also are being processed in a timely manner.  Since the end of February, when industry first demonstrated to safety regulators the capability to contain a subsea spill, twelve deepwater wells have been permitted.  H.R. 1229 would also require the Secretary of the Interior to grant an automatic one-year suspension of leases (effectively extending the term of the lease) in the Gulf of Mexico.  The Administration fully supports suspensions for Gulf of Mexico leaseholders directly impacted by the drilling moratorium.  Ten such suspensions have already been granted using administrative procedures to leaseholders who demonstrated that they were affected by the moratoria.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration will continue to work with the Congress to responsibly implement the Affordable Care Act.

This bill would strengthen the NFIP\u2019s current financial position and increase its ability to fund future claims.  The Administration is pleased that the bill would provide the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) with greater flexibility to set premium rates.  The bill provides improved protection for American taxpayers by requiring FEMA to use actuarial principles in determining full flood risk rates for certain properties. The bill would also phase in changes to let policyholders and communities adjust.  The bill would authorize studies and pilots to test alternative approaches to flood insurance that is sustainable and cost-effective.  The Administration recognizes the importance of improving the quality of flood risk information to the public and looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that implementation concerns related to notification requirements are addressed in the final version of the bill.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on further reform to strengthen the NFIP.    * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5856, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.   Last summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  The BCA created a framework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that would bring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national priorities.  Consistent with last summer's budget agreement, the FY 2013 Budget request provides the resources that the Department of Defense (DOD) needs to effectively meet the Nation's security requirements.  By adding unrequested funding for defense, the House of Representatives departs from the bipartisan understanding reached a year ago.  Upending the balance in the BCA has negative consequences that will, for example, cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially seniors, veterans, and children \u2013 as well as degrade many of the basic Government services on which the American people rely such as air traffic control and law enforcement.  In addition, these cuts were made in the context of a budget that fails the test of balance, fairness, and shared responsibility by giving millionaires and billionaires a tax cut and paying for it through deep cuts, including to discretionary programs.  Taking this into account, passing H.R. 5856 at its current funding level would mean that when the Congress constructs other appropriations bills, it would necessitate significant and harmful cuts to critical national priorities such as education, research and development, job training, and health care.  Furthermore, the bill undermines key investments in high-priority programs, impeding the ability of the Secretary of Defense to carry out the defense strategic guidance issued earlier this year, and hindering the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions consistent with the new strategy.  The Administration also strongly objects to the inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5856, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Administration Priorities.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for certain priorities, including:  funding for Overseas Contingency Operations; the requested pay raise for military personnel; DOD's program of basic research; the Defense Advanced Research Projects  Agency; and air and missile defense programs, including support for the Government of Israel to purchase additional Iron Dome missile systems.    Limitations on Retirement of Aircraft.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 8116 through 8118 of the bill that would restrict the Air Force and Army from divesting, transferring or retiring unneeded aircraft, including C-27Js, C-23s, and RQ-4 Global Hawk Block 30 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  These provisions would force DOD to operate, sustain, and maintain aircraft that are in excess to national security requirements, as defined by the new defense strategy, and are not affordable in an austere budget environment.  They also would impair the ability of the Secretary to manage the Department and, by retaining large numbers of under-resourced aircraft in the fleet in today's fiscally constrained environment, could contribute to a hollow force.   Unnecessary Funding.  The Administration is concerned about the billions of dollars the bill provides for items DOD did not request and does not need, as well as section 8006 of the bill, which makes spending on these unnecessary items statutorily required.  This diverts resources from more important defense programs and limits the Secretary's flexibility to manage the Department efficiently.   Incremental Funding.  The Administration strongly opposes the use of incremental funding, which undermines program stability and cost discipline.  The bill would provide incremental funding for Space-Based Infrared System satellites rather than full funding through advance appropriations, as the Administration requested in the FY 2013 Budget request.  In addition, the bill provides less than half of the $911 million requested to deactivate the USS Enterprise.   Army Depot Maintenance.  The Administration strongly objects to the reduction in the Army's depot maintenance program as specified in section 8087 of the bill.  The reduction of nearly $2.5 billion from the FY 2013 Budget request would create long-term delays in modernization and readiness for helicopters, radars, and the Stryker combat vehicle.  Additionally, with this funding reduction the Army would not meet core depot logistics requirements for many of its systems.  This cut would directly reduce Army readiness.   Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS).  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's decision to omit funding for MEADS.  If the Congress does not appropriate the funding in the FY 2013 Budget request, there is a high likelihood that this action would be perceived by our partners, Italy and Germany, as breaking our commitment under the Memorandum of Understanding.  This could harm our relationship with our Allies on a much broader basis, including future multinational cooperative projects.  It also could prevent the completion of the agreed Proof of Concept activities, which would provide data archiving, analysis of testing, and software development necessary to harvest technology from U.S. and partner investments in MEADS.   TRICARE Fees and Co-Payments.  The Administration is disappointed that the Congress did not incorporate the requested TRICARE fee initiatives into either the appropriation or authorization legislation.  The Administration asks the House to reconsider the TRICARE fee proposals, which are essential for DOD to successfully address rising personnel costs.  The $1.8 billion in savings are part of a carefully balanced FY 2013 Budget request.   Advanced Drop-In Biofuel Production.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $70 million from the FY 2013 Budget request intended to support the development of a domestic capability to 2  produce cost-competitive advanced drop-in biofuels at a commercial scale, which is important to the country's long-term national security.  Developing large-scale capacity to produce biofuels, in collaboration with the Departments of Agriculture and Energy, would help insulate the Nation as a whole, as well as the military, from price shocks arising from supply disruptions and price volatility of petroleum products.   MQ-8 Fire Scout UAV.  The Administration opposes the $66 million reduction from the FY 2013 Budget request for the Fire Scout upgrade, which would enable the Special Forces to track potential targets at greater distances and for longer periods.  The proposed reduction would prevent the Navy from fielding a system that meets the needs of the Special Forces in FY 2014.    Afloat Forward Staging Base (AFSB).  The Administration opposes elimination of funding for AFSB.  The $38 million requested in the FY 2013 Budget request is needed for advanced procurement of AFSB, which would meet Combatant Commanders' requirements for special operations and mine clearance.  Further, AFSB is critical to the health of the shipbuilding industrial base as it is the only auxiliary ship in the Navy's shipbuilding plan until FY 2016.   Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Systems.  The Administration objects to the 56-percent reduction from the FY 2013 Budget request for the CWMD Systems program, which integrates intelligence information about weapons of mass destruction for senior government officials.  The Military Departments and Combatant Commands have repeatedly identified data fusion as a critical capability gap.  The full $54 million requested in the FY 2013 Budget request is needed to start fusion center operations by the end of FY 2013.  The proposed reduction would cause the Department to assume significant tactical, operational, and strategic risk.  Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund (DAWDF).  The Administration opposes the reduction of $224 million from the FY 2013 Budget request for DAWDF.  Failure to provide the full request of $274 million would require DOD to collect from other budget accounts the shortfall between the appropriation and the statutory minimum for DAWDF.  The reduction in the appropriation would put unnecessary stress on the Operation and Maintenance budget at a time when funding levels are already constrained.   General Transfer Authority.  The Administration opposes the reduction of general transfer authority provided in section 8005 of the bill.  The $3 billion limit provided by the Committee significantly restricts DOD's ability to accommodate changing circumstances and to respond to urgent requirements in support of deployed forces, such as for force protection, in a timely manner.  DOD needs sufficient transfer authority in order to match individual accounts to programmatic needs.   Intelligence Community Management Account.  The Administration opposes the exclusion of section 8045 proposed in the FY 2013 Budget request, which provides critical language to authorize the Program Manager for the Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE) to transfer funds to other Federal departments and agencies.  Without transfer authority, PM-ISE would lose its ability to leverage agency efforts and work effectively with non-Federal partners to improve the performance of the information sharing environment in support of national security.    Classified Programs.  The Administration understands that there could be problematic funding adjustments contained in the Classified Annex to the bill and looks forward to providing its views on 3  this annex once it becomes available.   Civilian Pay Freeze.  The Administration objects to section 8119 of the bill, which does not fund the 0.5 percent civilian pay raise for calendar year 2013 proposed in the FY 2013 Budget request.  As the President stated in his FY 2013 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.   Riders  The Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders that have no place in funding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill:  Limitation on Reimbursement of the Government of Pakistan.  Section 9015 would require the Secretary of Defense to certify Pakistan's cooperation on issues outside of his purview and would severely constrict DOD's ability to respond to emergent war-time coalition support requirements, negatively affecting our campaign in Afghanistan.  Veterans Memorial Object Transfer.  Section 8120 would prohibit the transfer of a veterans memorial object to a foreign country or an entity controlled by a foreign government without specific authorization in law.  This provision would restrict the President's ability to take actions to demonstrate goodwill toward foreign allies and partners by lending or giving historical artifacts in instances where doing so would serve the national security interests of the United States.   Detainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to and has constitutional concerns about the provisions of sections 8108 and 8109 that limit the use of funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee transfers.  Section 8108 undermines national security and this unnecessarily constrains the Nation's counterterrorism efforts, particularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 option for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have leveraged the flexibility and strength of this country's Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous terrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The continued prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an essential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available option.  Additionally, the restrictions in section 8109 on the transfer of detainees to the United States and to the custody or effective control of foreign countries or entities in the context of an ongoing armed conflict may interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and to make important foreign policy and national security determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers should occur.  The restrictions or interferences in both these sections would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.     In addition, the Administration strongly opposes section 8110 which would prohibit the use of funds to construct, acquire or modify a detention facility in the United States.  This would constrain the flexibility that the Nation's Armed Forces and counterterrorism professionals need to deal with evolving threats, intruding upon the Executive Branch's ability to carry out its mission.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  4  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H. J. Res. 2.   We do not need to amend the Constitution for only the 28th time in our nation\u2019s history to do the job of restoring fiscal discipline.  Instead, it requires us \u2013 as members of both parties have done in the past \u2013 to move beyond politics as usual and find bipartisan common ground to restore us to a sustainable fiscal path.  H. J. Res. 2 would impose serious risks for our economy in several ways. It risks accelerating economic downturns by requiring the government to raise taxes and cut spending in the face of a contraction, which would accelerate job losses. The President proposed a balanced approach to restore fiscal sustainability and in a way that doesn\u2019t slow the Federal Government's ability to initiate actions that help stabilize the economy and keep future recessions from becoming worse.  By contrast, under H. J. Res. 2, a minority in a single house of Congress could block the will of the majority and the Executive to waive its provisions when our country faces a downturn. If H. J. Res. 2 had been in effect in recent years, such a minority in one house would have been able to prevent efforts to override the requirement for tax increases or spending cuts, risking an even deeper contraction and pushing the economy into a second Great Depression.   Further, H. J. Res. 2 ducks responsibility and does not take the Nation's fiscal challenges head-on.  Rather, it could inevitably result in handing the hard decisions that our elected representatives in the Congress should be making to the Federal Courts.    In addition, absent a willingness to raise substantially higher revenues than in the House Budget Resolution by closing tax loopholes or asking the most fortunate to pay more, H. J. Res. 2 would undercut the Federal Government's ability to meet its core commitments to seniors, middle class families and the most vulnerable, while reducing our ability to invest in our future. This could result in severe cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security that are growing due to the retirement of the baby boomers, putting at risk the retirement security of millions of Americans, and it could result in significant cuts to education, research and development, and other programs critical to growing our economy and winning the future.    H. J. Res. 2 is not a solution to the Nation's deficits.  The Administration is committed to working with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to achieve real deficit reduction.

The President urges the Committee to meet or exceed its mandate for deficit reduction.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2230, which would set a minimum tax rate for taxpayers with annual income greater than $1 million.  S. 2230 will ensure that the Nation's wealthiest people are not able to use tax preferences and shelters to reduce their tax rate below what middle class families pay.   Over the past fifty years, the average tax rate paid by the very highest-income Americans has fallen to a near low \u2013 even as their share of the Nation's income has risen to one of the highest levels in close to a century.  As a result, one in four taxpayers with annual income greater than $1 million today pays a lower tax rate than millions of hardworking middle-class households.    S. 2230 would address that most basic source of unfairness by limiting the degree to which the most financially fortunate can take advantage of tax expenditures and preferential rates on certain income.  The Administration believes that S. 2230 would not only make the Nation's tax system more fair, but will also help the economy by closing inefficient tax shelters and loopholes and by allowing the Nation to continue making the vital investments that strengthen the economy and provide economic security for middle class families.  All Americans are being asked to come together to make the sort of shared sacrifices that will allow the Nation to continue making crucial investments in areas that will help the economy grow and create jobs, such as education, research, and infrastructure.

In support of more safe and responsible domestic oil and gas production, the Administration is already taking steps including: expediting the search for resources; leasing new areas both offshore and onshore; providing incentives for the development of existing leases; and issuing permits to drill, consistent with rigorous safety standards and environmental responsibility.  However, the Administration opposes H.R. 2021, because it would curtail the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to help ensure that domestic oil production on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) proceeds safely, responsibly, and with opportunities for efficient stakeholder input.   H.R. 2021 would limit existing EPA authority to protect human health and the environment.  The bill would:  (1) preclude EPA from requiring offshore sources to demonstrate compliance with health-based air quality standards anywhere but in a single onshore area; (2) reduce the length of time during which exploration platforms and drill ships are emission sources under the CAA, thereby limiting the time when emissions would be controlled; and (3) make it impossible to use the permitting program to set emission control requirements for service vessels associated with offshore sources.  These changes could result in increased air pollution from OCS sources, including nitrogen dioxide, particles, and sulfur dioxide.  H.R. 2021 would increase Federal court litigation and deprive citizens of an important avenue for challenging government action that affects local public health.

At the same time that the House is advancing a bill to extend tax cuts for wealthy individuals while raising taxes on 25 million students and working families, H.R. 6684 would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle class and vulnerable Americans \u2013 especially seniors, veterans, and children.  The President has made clear that the Congress can and must act to avoid the sweeping impacts of sequestration by passing a balanced deficit reduction package.  The bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) included a sequestration mechanism with mutually disagreeable cuts to both defense and non-defense funding.  This sequestration, scheduled to occur on January 2, 2013, would have destructive effects on national security; on important domestic investments such as education, research and development, and rebuilding the Nation's crumbling infrastructure; and on core government programs from air traffic control to law enforcement.  The threat of these destructive cuts under the BCA was intended to force action by the Congress on deficit reduction.  In contrast, the approach put forward in this bill, virtually identical to earlier legislation, eliminates the defense portion of the pending sequester and does so in a way that imposes far greater cuts in the non-defense part of the budget than the existing sequester would entail.     H.R. 6684 would do nothing to address the reductions in discretionary spending and the sequestration in mandatory programs after 2013.   Rather than pursuing a comprehensive, balanced deficit reduction package to replace sequestration, H.R. 6684 undermines the intent of the BCA to bring both sides to compromise by proposing a short-term, one-sided solution.  This approach sharply undermines critical domestic priorities, such as efforts to prevent hunger and support low-income families and communities; to make health care more affordable through the implementation of the health care law; to protect consumers and implement the Wall Street Reform Act; and to support homeowners struggling to stay in their homes.  The Administration strongly opposes both the principles of this approach and specific legislative proposals included in the bill.   If the President were presented with H.R. 6684, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of S. 1786 because the bill does not give the Nation\u2019s economy the jumpstart it needs right now, even as it would undermine key environmental and public health protections and seriously disrupt the Federal Government's services.  The President has proposed immediately investing $50 billion in the Nation's highways, transit, rail, and aviation, which would put hundreds of thousands of construction workers back on the job and modernize America's crumbling infrastructure for the long-term.  The President has also proposed a national infrastructure bank capitalized with $10 billion, in order to leverage private and public capital in innovative and reform-minded ways without earmarks or political influence.  None of these proposals are contained in S. 1786.  Among the problematic provisions that the Administration strongly opposes that are included in this bill are:    Title IV of the bill would impose an unprecedented requirement that a joint resolution of approval be enacted by the Congress before any major rule of Executive Branch agencies could have force or effect.  This radical departure from the longstanding separation of powers between the Executive and Legislative branches would delay and, in many cases, thwart implementation of statutory mandates and execution of duly enacted laws, increase business uncertainty, undermine much-needed protections of the American public, and create unnecessary confusion. There is no justification for such an unprecedented requirement.    Title V and Section 140 would undermine public health protections under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from moving ahead with long-overdue requirements to reduce air pollution from industrial boilers, solid waste incinerators, and cement plants.  They also weaken EPA's ability to ensure that its standards protect American families from a range of harmful pollutants including mercury and other toxic metals, as well as smog and soot.  Delaying implementation of important air pollution standards would increase exposure to mercury, which can impair children's ability to think and learn.  Delay due to this title and section could mean foregoing over a hundred billion dollars in health benefits.  Each additional year of delay would mean foregoing tens of billions of dollars more in net benefits.  Title VI, the Regulatory Time-Out Act of 2011, would block implementation of critical public health and safety protections.  This Administration is committed to a regulatory system that is informed by science, cost-justified, and consistent with economic growth.  Finally, S. 1786 seeks to pay for its proposals with a rescission of $40 billion of appropriated funds that runs counter to the spirit of two recent bipartisan agreements, including the recently- enacted Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  Disregarding the BCA agreement and cutting already-tight discretionary program levels even further, as this bill would do, would be a serious mistake.  The bill's unspecified rescission of $40 billion in appropriated funds would cause serious disruption in the Federal Government\u2019s basic services in support of critical national goals, such as supporting education, protecting public safety, and promoting economic growth.  If the President is presented with S. 1786, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration opposes HR 2417, which would repeal energy efficiency standards for light bulbs, because it would result in negative economic consequences for U.S. consumers and the economy.  The Department of Energy has estimated that the lighting standards that H.R. 2417 would repeal could collectively save U.S. households nearly $6 billion in 2015 alone.  These standards are: (1) helping to drive U.S. innovation; (2) creating new manufacturing jobs in the United States; (3) saving consumers money by providing them with energy and cost efficient lighting; and (4) reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions.  Further, H.R. 2417 is unnecessary.  Any type of bulb can be sold as long as it meets the efficiency requirements.  In sum, the bill would hinder an opportunity to save American consumers money, while enhancing energy efficiency and reducing harmful emissions associated with energy production.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 2832, which renews the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs.  The TAA provisions renew coverage for American workers whose jobs have been adversely affected by global competition.  These workers need, and would benefit from, job retraining and other services.  As the United States expands access to other markets through new Free Trade Agreements, the Federal Government can help ensure that American workers are provided with the tools they need to take advantage of opportunities for retraining and other services and to compete in the global economy.  The TAA provisions preserve the key goals of the 2009 TAA program reforms (which expired in February, 2011), such as covering service workers and workers whose jobs shift to China, India, and other countries, to help ensure workers adversely affected by global competition are given the best opportunity to acquire skills and credentials to get good jobs.  The Administration estimates that this version of TAA will provide significant savings when compared to a straight extension of the full 2009 program. The Administration is pleased that this legislation also renews and extends the GSP, one of the United States' largest preference programs. The GSP program provides preferential, duty-free entry to the United States for up to 4,800 products from 129 designated beneficiary countries and territories.  Many GSP imports are used as inputs by U.S. companies to manufacture goods here in the United States.  The program is particularly important to American small businesses, many of which rely on the program's duty savings to stay competitive.  The lapse in GSP authorization has already cost U.S. businesses tens of millions of dollars in additional import duties, increased costs to American manufacturers and consumers, and undercut efforts by poor countries to grow their economies and fight poverty.  Timely passage of this legislation will address these concerns.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration is committed to increasing public-private sharing of information about cybersecurity threats as an essential part of comprehensive legislation to protect the Nation's vital information systems and critical infrastructure.  The sharing of information must be conducted in a manner that preserves Americans' privacy, data confidentiality, and civil liberties and recognizes the civilian nature of cyberspace.  Cybersecurity and privacy are not mutually exclusive.  Moreover, information sharing, while an essential component of comprehensive legislation, is not alone enough to protect the Nation's core critical infrastructure from cyber threats.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3523, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, in its current form.  H.R. 3523 fails to provide authorities to ensure that the Nation's core critical infrastructure is protected while repealing important provisions of electronic surveillance law without instituting corresponding privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties safeguards.  For example, the bill would allow broad sharing of information with governmental entities without establishing requirements for both industry and the Government to minimize and protect personally identifiable information.  Moreover, such sharing should be accomplished in a way that permits appropriate sharing within the Government without undue restrictions imposed by private sector companies that share information.  The bill also lacks sufficient limitations on the sharing of personally identifiable information between private entities and does not contain adequate oversight or accountability measures necessary to ensure that the data is used only for appropriate purposes.  Citizens have a right to know that corporations will be held legally accountable for failing to safeguard personal information adequately.  The Government, rather than establishing a new antitrust exemption under this bill, should ensure that information is not shared for anti-competitive purposes.    In addition, H.R. 3523 would inappropriately shield companies from any suits where a company's actions are based on cyber threat information identified, obtained, or shared under this bill, regardless of whether that action otherwise violated Federal criminal law or results in damage or loss of life.  This broad liability protection not only removes a strong incentive to improving cybersecurity, it also potentially undermines our Nation's economic, national security, and public safety interests.  H.R. 3523 effectively treats domestic cybersecurity as an intelligence activity and thus, significantly departs from longstanding efforts to treat the Internet and cyberspace as civilian spheres.  The Administration believes that a civilian agency \u2013 the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 must have a central role in domestic cybersecurity, including for conducting and  overseeing the exchange of cybersecurity information with the private sector and with sector-specific Federal agencies. The American people expect their Government to enhance security without undermining their privacy and civil liberties.  Without clear legal protections and independent oversight, information sharing legislation will undermine the public's trust in the Government as well as in the Internet by undermining fundamental privacy, confidentiality, civil liberties, and consumer protections.  The Administration's draft legislation, submitted last May, provided for information sharing with clear privacy protections and strong oversight by the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.    The Administration's proposal also provided authority for the Federal Government to ensure that the Nation's critical infrastructure operators are taking the steps necessary to protect the American people.  The Congress must also include authorities to ensure our Nation's most vital critical infrastructure assets are properly protected by meeting minimum cybersecurity performance standards.  Industry would develop these standards collaboratively with the Department of Homeland Security.  Voluntary measures alone are insufficient responses to the growing danger of cyber threats.    Legislation should address core critical infrastructure vulnerabilities without sacrificing the fundamental values of privacy and civil liberties for our citizens, especially at a time our Nation is facing challenges to our economic well-being and national security.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to engage with the Congress in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to enact cybersecurity legislation to address these critical issues.  However, for the reasons stated herein, if H.R. 3523 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they are tailored to advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that they minimize uncertainty.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 527, the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act.  The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act would impose unneeded and costly analytical and procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from performing their statutory responsibilities.  It would also create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty and increase costs for businesses and further impede the implementation of commonsense protections for the American public.  The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act would impose unnecessary new procedures on agencies and invite frivolous litigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and well understood procedural requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act and other federal statutes such as the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  With respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act in particular, agencies already have in place procedures and policies, as required by Executive Order 13272, to ensure that agencies take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.  Furthermore, this Administration\u2019s deep commitment to promoting small business and ensuring that regulations do not unduly burden the Nation\u2019s small businesses is reflected in Executive Order 13563, which requires agencies to examine existing regulations and to eliminate, streamline, or alter them where they are excessively burdensome, and the January 18 President Memorandum on Regulatory Flexibility, Small Business, and Job Creation.  Furthermore, this Administration's deep commitment to promoting small business and ensuring that regulations do not unduly burden the Nation's small businesses is reflected in Executive Order 13563, which requires agencies to examine existing regulations and to eliminate, streamline, or alter them where they are excessively burdensome.  Passage of H.R. 527 would replace the existing framework with layers of additional procedural requirements that would seriously undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory mandates.  It would unjustifiably expand the use of advocacy review panels, require excessive and unnecessary retrospective review of rules, and create needless grounds of judicial review and judicial remedies.  It would also impose unrealistic analytic requirements on agencies far beyond the already rigorous existing requirements that promote commonsense regulation.  In these ways and others, the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act would impede the ability of agencies to provide the public with  basic protections, and create needless confusion and delay that would prove disruptive for businesses, as well as for state, tribal and local governments.     If the President were presented with the Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 3094 because it would undermine and delay workers\u2019 ability to exercise their right to choose whether or not to be represented by a union.

As a whole, this bill represents a fair, balanced, and necessary effort to improve patent quality, enable greater work sharing between the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and other countries, improve service to patent applicants and the public at the USPTO, and offer productive alternatives to costly and complex litigation.  By moving the United States to a first-to-file system, the bill simplifies the process of acquiring rights.  This essential provision will reduce legal costs, improve fairness, and support U.S. innovators seeking to market their products and services in a global marketplace.  Further, by providing authority for the USPTO to establish and adjust its fees to reflect changes in costs, demand, and workload, the bill would enhance productivity \u2013 reducing delay in the patent application process \u2013 and ensure full cost recovery at no taxpayer expense.  Senate passage of this bill is consistent with the Administration\u2019s commitment to support and encourage innovation that leads to improved competiveness, economic prosperity, and job growth \u2013 without adding a penny to the deficit.  Finally, the Administration understands that several stakeholders have suggested that the provisions on damages and venue are no longer needed in the legislation in light of recent court decisions in these areas.  The Administration would not object to removal of these provisions from the final version of the legislation.

The Presidential election public financing system was enacted in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal to free the Nation\u2019s elections from the influence of corporations and other wealthy special interests.  Rather than candidates having to rely on raising large sums of private money in order to run, the system provides qualifying presidential candidates with the option of accepting matching funds in the primary and a public grant in the general election.  It has done so at minimal cost to taxpayers, who fund it by voluntarily choosing to direct $3 of their Federal taxes to this beneficial system.  For many years, the system worked well and attracted wide participation.  In time, however, it became clear that a system introduced in the 1970s was in need of modernization and repair.  Beginning in the 2000 Presidential campaign, candidates began to opt out.  Since that time, promising proposals for the strengthening of the system have been made.    H.R. 359 would kill the system, not strengthen it.  Its effect would be to expand the power of corporations and special interests in the Nation\u2019s elections; to force many candidates into an endless cycle of fundraising at the expense of engagement with voters on the issues; and to place a premium on access to large donor or special interest support, narrowing the field of otherwise worthy candidates.  After a year in which the Citizens United decision rolled back a century of law to allow corporate interests to spend vast sums in the Nation\u2019s elections and to do so without disclosing the true interests behind them, this is not the time to further empower the special interests or to obstruct the work of reform.    * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration will continue to work with the Congress to responsibly implement the Affordable Care Act.

Women continue to earn substantially less than men for performing the same work.  Women earn only 77 cents for every dollar men earn, with women of color at an even greater disadvantage with 64 cents on the dollar for African American women and 56 cents for Hispanic women.  As more and more American families rely on women's wages for a significant portion of their income, the pay gap hurts not only women, but the families that depend on them.  The Paycheck Fairness Act is commonsense legislation that strengthens the Equal Pay Act and would give women the tools they need to fight pay discrimination.  This bill would address the pay gap by enhancing enforcement of equal pay laws.  Specifically, it would prohibit retaliation against employees who ask about or discuss wage information, and would provide more effective remedies for women subjected to discriminatory pay practices.  S. 3220 would strengthen the Equal Pay Act by closing judicially-created loopholes for employer defenses and by bringing its class action rules into conformity with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  S. 3220 also requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect pay data to enable better enforcement of laws prohibiting pay discrimination.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4970, a bill that would undermine the core principles of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).  VAWA is a landmark piece of legislation that first passed the Congress in 1994 and has twice been reauthorized with overwhelming bipartisan support, each time with important improvements to strengthen VAWA.  The Act transformed the Nation's response to violence against women and brought critically needed resources to States and local communities to address these crimes.  H.R. 4970 retreats from this forward progress by failing to include several critical provisions that are part of the Senate-passed VAWA reauthorization bill.  For instance, H.R. 4970 fails to provide for concurrent special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction by tribal authorities over non-Indians, and omits clarification of tribal courts' full civil jurisdiction regarding certain protection orders over non-Indians.  Given that three out of five Native American women experience domestic violence in their lifetime, these omissions in H.R. 4970 are unacceptable.  The bill also fails to include language that would prohibit discrimination against LGBT victims in VAWA grant programs.  No sexual assault or domestic violence victim should be beaten, hurt, or killed because they could not access needed support, assistance, and protection.  In addition, H.R. 4970 does not include important improvements to the Clery Act found in the Senate-passed bill that would address the high rates of dating violence and sexual assault experienced by young people in college and other higher education institutions.  The bill also weakens critical new provisions in the Senate-passed bill that would improve safety for victims living in subsidized housing.   H.R. 4970 also takes direct aim at immigrant victims of domestic violence and sexual assault by removing critical protections currently in law.  H.R. 4970 allows abusers to be notified when a victim files a VAWA self-petition for relief, and it eliminates the path to citizenship for U visa holders \u2013 victims of serious crimes such as torture, rape, and domestic violence \u2013 who are cooperating with law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of these crimes.  These proposals senselessly remove existing legal protections, undermine VAWA's core purpose of protecting victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, frustrate important law enforcement objectives, and jeopardize victims by placing them directly in harm's way.   The Administration urges the House to find common ground with the bipartisan Senate-passed bill and consider and pass legislation that will protect all victims.  H.R. 4970 rolls back existing law and removes long-standing protections for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault \u2013 crimes that predominately affect women.

Res. 37, which would overturn long-overdue national clean air standards limiting power plant emissions of toxic air pollution, including mercury.  As a result, this resolution would cause substantial harm to public health and undermine our Nation's longstanding commitment to clean up pollution from power plants.  Since it was enacted in 1970 and amended in 1977 and 1990, each time with strong bipartisan support, the Clean Air Act (CAA) has improved the Nation's air quality and protected public health.  Since 1970, the economy has grown over 200 percent while emissions of key pollutants have decreased more than 60 percent.  More than forty years of clean air regulation has shown that a strong economy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.  S.J. Res. 37 would undermine more than forty years of CAA progress by blocking the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, the first national standards to protect American families from harmful power plant emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollution like arsenic, acid gases, nickel, and chromium.  By addressing the largest remaining source of mercury emissions in the United States, these standards will reduce our children's exposure to this neurotoxicant which can impair their ability to think and learn.  Because technology to control toxics also reduces fine particle pollution, the standards will help America's children grow up healthier, preventing 130,000 cases of childhood asthma symptoms and over 6,000 cases of acute bronchitis among children each year.  EPA further estimates that emissions reductions resulting from meeting these standards will prevent as many as 11,000 avoidable premature deaths and 4,700 heart attacks, annually.  The annual value of these health benefits alone is estimated to be as much as $90 billion.  In addition, the standards will reduce the risk of numerous other non-monetized yet devastating health effects, including illnesses of the central nervous system, damage to kidneys, and cancer.  The Mercury and Air Toxics Standards will ensure that the Nation's power plants install modern, widely available technologies to limit harmful pollution \u2013 leveling the playing field for power plants that already have such controls in place.  The standards are achievable; pollution control equipment that can help meet them already is installed at more than half of the Nation's coal-fired power plants.  Numerous studies, including analysis by the Department of Energy, have projected that the standards can be met without adversely affecting the adequacy of electric generation resources in any region of the country.  Finally, if a rule is disapproved under the Congressional Review Act, an agency may not issue a rule that is \u201csubstantially the same.\u201d  In this case, because EPA has adhered closely to its narrowly  circumscribed authority under the CAA in promulgating these standards, the enactment of S.J.

The Agreement advances U.S. national economic interests and meets the negotiating principles and objectives set out by Congress in the Trade Act of 2002.  Under the Agreement, over 80 percent of U.S. industrial and consumer goods exports (not including petroleum) will gain duty-free access to the Colombian market immediately upon implementation.  This will help to level the playing field, since 91 percent of our imports from Colombia have enjoyed duty- free access to our market.  U.S. agricultural exports in particular will enjoy substantial new improvements in access to Colombia's market.  Currently, no U.S. agricultural exports enjoy duty free access to Colombia.  Once the Agreement enters into force, almost 70 percent, by value, of current U.S. agricultural exports will be able to enter Colombia duty-free immediately.  The Agreement contains state of the art provisions to help protect and enforce intellectual property rights, reduce regulatory red tape, and eliminate regulatory barriers to U.S. exports.  The Agreement also contains high standards for protecting labor rights, carrying out covered environmental agreements, and ensuring that key domestic labor and environmental laws are enforced, combined with strong remedies for non-compliance.  Colombia has already made significant reforms related to the obligations it will have under the labor chapter, including measures taken under the Colombian Action Plan Related to Labor Rights.  The Administration will ensure that Colombia has successfully implemented key elements of the Action Plan before the Administration will bring the Agreement into force.  The Agreement forms an integral part of the Administration's larger strategy of doubling exports by the end of 2014.  In addition, the Agreement represents an historic development in our relations with Colombia, a steadfast strategic partner for the United States and a leader in the region.  The Agreement reflects the commitment of the United States to supporting democracy and economic growth in Colombia.  The Agreement will also help Colombia battle production of illegal crops by creating alternative economic opportunities.  The bill also extends the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), which helps countries in their fight against drug production and trafficking by expanding their economic alternatives.  Extension of this program will restore, until the entry into force of the Agreement, the access that Colombian goods had enjoyed under ATPA prior to its expiration in February 2011.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2401, which would block two landmark public health regulations under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and require the preparation of costly, unnecessary, and redundant reports.  While the Administration strongly supports careful analysis of the economic effects of regulation, the approach taken in H.R. 2401 would slow or undermine important public health protections.  Since its enactment in 1970 and subsequent amendment in 1990, both times with strong bipartisan support, the CAA has improved the Nation's air quality and protected the health of this country\u2019s citizens.  Forty years of success have demonstrated that strong environmental protections and strong economic growth go hand in hand.  H.R. 2401 would undermine this progress by blocking EPA's ability to move forward with two long overdue CAA rules \u2013 the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard and the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule \u2013 to reduce harmful air pollution that threatens public health, especially the health of the most vulnerable populations, including children and seniors.  Each year, these rules would avoid tens of thousands of premature deaths, prevent tens of thousands of heart attacks and thousands of hospital visits for respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and alleviate hundreds of thousands of childhood asthma attacks and other respiratory illnesses.  EPA estimates that these two rules alone will yield hundreds of billions of dollars in net benefits each year.

Absent Congressional action, on July 1, the interest rate on new subsidized Federal Direct Stafford Loans for undergraduate students is set to double, from 3.4% to 6.8%.  Taking action to stop the doubling of these rates will save students $1,000, on average, over the life of their loans.  Students are increasingly relying on loans to finance postsecondary education, often absorbing tuition hikes stemming from reductions in State funding and institutional support.  Graduates should not be burdened with unmanageable college debt as they seek to launch a career or a business, start a family, or buy a house.    Unfortunately, rather than finding common ground on a way to pay for this critical policy, H.R. 4628 includes an attempt to repeal the Prevention and Public Health Fund, created to help prevent disease, detect it early, and manage conditions before they become severe.  Women, in particular, will benefit from this Prevention Fund, which would provide for hundreds of thousands of screenings for breast and cervical cancer.

While lacking some of the key provisions of earlier bills, the revised legislation will provide important tools to strengthen the Nation's response to cybersecurity risks.  The legislation also reflects many of the priorities included in the Administration's legislative proposal. The Administration particularly appreciates the bill's strong protections for privacy and civil liberties and would not support amendments that weaken these protections.  The Administration agrees that it is essential that the collection, use, and disclosure of such information remain closely tied to the purposes of detecting and mitigating cybersecurity threats, while still allowing law enforcement to investigate and prosecute serious crimes.  All entities \u2013 public and private \u2013must be accountable for how they handle such data.  The bill should take care not to duplicate existing domestic or international law enforcement frameworks.  The bill also must protect the confidentiality of statistical data and honor the statutory confidentiality pledges made to respondents.  The Administration is confident that S. 3414 can improve the Nation's cybersecurity while protecting the privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties that are central to American values.   The revised bill contains critical-infrastructure protection measures that are less robust than in earlier drafts, but would still produce meaningful cybersecurity improvements.  However, the Administration would not support amendments that would weaken the critical infrastructure protection measures in the legislation, including: (1) reducing the Federal Government's existing roles and responsibilities in coordinating and endorsing the outcome-based cybersecurity practices; (2) weakening the statutory authorities of the Department of Homeland Security to accomplish its critical infrastructure protection mission; or (3) substantially expanding the narrowly-tailored liability protections for private sector entities.  While liability limitations are necessary to encourage information sharing, overly broad immunities from legal obligations would undermine the very trust that the bill seeks to strengthen. S. 3414 would create an interagency National Cybersecurity Council to coordinate the identification of voluntary cybersecurity practices for critical cyber infrastructure.  As currently drafted, the structure of the National Cybersecurity Council raises constitutional concerns and should be amended to employ an administrative structure similar to that of other recently established councils.  Further, the bill contains provisions purporting to prescribe the Executive branch's responsibilities in coordinating with foreign governments and conducting diplomatic negotiations.  These provisions should be clarified so as to maintain the President's exclusive  constitutional authority to conduct diplomacy.  The Administration also believes that to ensure consistency with existing law, processes, and Presidential directives, certain provisions must be addressed in the final bill regarding the protection of intelligence sources and methods, as well as information sharing and policy coordination.

The importance of this requirement is documented in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review and was an element in support of ratification of the New START Treaty.  This bill would limit the Department of Defense's (DOD's) ability to assemble critical CPGS technology data, delay transition from technology development to an acquisition program, and ultimately delay deployment of a CPGS system by two years.   Advance Appropriations for Acquisitions.  The bill would provide only incremental funding \u2013 undermining stability and cost discipline \u2013 rather than the advance appropriations that the Administration requested for the procurement of Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellites and certain classified programs.   Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF).  The bill would eliminate base and Overseas Contingency Operations JUONF funding, critical to DOD's ability to quickly respond to urgent warfighter needs and effectively address Combatant Commanders' urgent operational requirements in a timely manner.   Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Spacecraft.  The level of resources the bill would provide for the Air Force\u2019s Rocket Systems Launch Program would prevent DOD from launching the refurbished DSCOVR spacecraft, part of an interagency partnership with the Department of  Commerce, which would provide forecasts of geomagnetic storm conditions and imminent warnings of adverse solar events, helping to protect the Nation's military and economic assets including our commercial electric grid and communications and airline operations.    Medium Extended Air Defense Systems (MEADS).  The Administration appreciates the support for DOD's air and missile defense programs; however, the level of resources the bill would provide for the MEADS program could trigger unilateral withdrawal by the U.S. from the MEADS Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Germany and Italy, which could further lead to a DOD obligation to pay all contract costs \u2013 a scenario that would likely exceed the cost of satisfying DOD\u2019s commitment under the MOU.  This reduction also could call into question DOD's ability to honor its financial commitments in other binding cooperative MOUs and have adverse consequences for other international cooperative programs.    Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Actions.  Section 8112 of the bill would impede the Secretary's ability to make and implement force management decisions that would ensure resources are directed to the highest priorities.  Investment in Innovation.  The bill\u2019s funding level for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for high-priority science and technology programs would undermine the Nation\u2019s ability to invest in innovation and ideas that would have long-term benefits for the country\u2019s national security and economy.  Assured SATCOM Services In Single Theater (ASSIST).  Acquiring the satellite as part of the ASSIST program as proposed in the 2012 Budget would be far more cost effective than the Committee's proposed alternative which would result in DOD continuing to lease commercial satellites while procuring a Wideband Global Satellite that would not be ready for many years.   C-17 Transport Aircraft.  Additional funding for an unrequested C-17 airlift is unnecessary and diverts resources that could be used for higher priority programs, since analyses by DOD have shown that there are already more C-17s in the force and on order than are needed to meet the Department's current and future airlift needs, even under the most stressing situations.  Intelligence Community Management Account.  The reduction in funding for this account would impair the Director of National Intelligence's ability to lead Intelligence Community integration and oversight.   Classified Programs.  The Administration looks forward to providing its views on the Classified Annex to the bill once it becomes available.   The bill includes the following problematic policy and language issues:  Prohibition of TRICARE Prime Increases for One Year.  Language in the report, which is incorporated into statute by section 8006, would seek to prohibit TRICARE Prime enrollment fee increases for one year.  This language is contrary to the House-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012, and would hinder implementation of the TRICARE proposals included in the President\u2019s Budget.  The Administration understands this language was added inadvertently, and requests that it be deleted from the report.    Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq (OSC-I).  The Department appreciates the funding provided for OSC-I; section 9013 of the bill does not authorize funding for Security Assistance Teams (SATs) in 2  Iraq or the operations and activities of the OSC-I within the funds provided.  The requested funding supports SATs for 2012, which is needed to accomplish the OSC-I mission.  Section 9013, as currently worded, would eliminate the Department's ability to support SATs, which implement the Iraqi Security Forces Mission Essential Capability development program.    Intelligence Community Reprogramming Thresholds and General Transfer Authority (GTA).  The Administration objects to sections 8091, 8092 and 8120, which would reduce the Director of National Intelligence's ability to respond quickly to unforeseen and emergent requirements.    Military Information Support Operations.  Section 8119 of the bill restricts the use of funding in the base budget for Information Operations/Military Information Support Operations activities.  These activities are a core capability of the Department and support military objectives during peacetime and contingency operations.    Detainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions that limit the use of authorized funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee transfers.  Although the Administration opposes the release of detainees within the United States, section 8123 is a dangerous and extraordinary challenge to critical Executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute detainees, based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and national security interests.  It unnecessarily constrains the Nation's counterterrorism efforts and would undermine national security, particularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 option for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have leveraged the flexibility and strength of this country's criminal justice system to incapacitate dangerous terrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an essential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available option.  The certification requirement in section 8124, restricting transfers to foreign countries, interferes with the authority of the Executive branch to make important foreign policy and national security determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers should occur.  Broadly speaking, the detention provisions in HR 2219 seek to reduce the flexibility and decision making of our military, intelligence, and law enforcement personnel.  Those professionals have successfully led a Government-wide effort to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al\u2013Qa\u2019ida over several Administrations.  The Administration believes strongly that it is a mistake for members of Congress to overrule or limit the tactical flexibility of the Nation\u2019s counterterrorism professionals, including our military commanders, intelligence professionals, seasoned counterterrorism prosecutors, or other operators in the field.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 appropriations process moves forward to ensure the Administration can support enactment of the legislation.  * * * * * * *   3  ", "The Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas production as part of a broad energy strategy that will protect consumers and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  That strategy, among other things, includes a balanced process to open new areas for leasing, prepare for the possibility of oil spills, and encourage responsible development of existing leases.  The Administration opposes H.R. 1231, which would undermine and circumvent the transparent public process for determining which new areas are appropriate to lease.  H.R. 1231 would require the Department of the Interior (DOI) to open new areas on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to leasing without any discretion to determine which areas are actually appropriate and safe for exploration and development.  The bill would have the effect of mandating OCS lease sales along the entire East Coast, offshore California, and elsewhere, without providing states and local citizens the opportunity to share views about where exploration should happen.    The Administration is developing a 5-year (2012-2017) comprehensive plan for offshore oil and gas exploration and production that incorporates lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  This plan, developed through a public review process, will assess which areas of the OCS are appropriate for future oil and gas leasing.  In addition, the Administration is focusing on resources that are already available for development under existing plans.  A recent DOI report shows that about 70 percent of leased offshore acres are not being explored or developed.  Given the untapped potential of those areas, the Administration is pursuing a number of policies to promote timely and responsible development of those OCS leases.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration supports H.R. 1473, making continuing appropriations for the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies of the Government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, and for other purposes.  The legislation makes the largest annual spending cuts in the Nation\u2019s history, while at the same time investing in America's future in significant ways.  Although the Administration would not have agreed to many of these cuts under better fiscal circumstances, the bill reflects a compromise that will help the Federal Government live within its means while protecting those investments that will help America compete for new jobs.  These include investments in education, clean energy, and life-saving medical research. However, the Administration strongly opposes any attempts to include language in the underlying bill that would deny funding for critical women\u2019s health services or prohibit funding to implement the Affordable Care Act that is making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.  The Administration is committed to cutting spending and reducing the deficit to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal path.

The Agreement advances U.S. national economic interests and meets the negotiating principles and objectives set out by the Congress in the Trade Act of 2002.  Since 1985, our trade relationship with Panama has been characterized by the unilateral trade preferences that the United States provides through the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) program.  This program has contributed to economic growth and development and export diversification in Panama.  The Agreement will build on the success of the CBI program.  Today, Panama is one of the fastest-growing economies in the Western Hemisphere.  Most imports from Panama currently enter the United States duty-free, but U.S. exports to Panama face substantial tariffs.  The Agreement will create significant new opportunities for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses by opening Panama's market and eliminating barriers to U.S. goods, services and investment.  Upon entry into force of the Agreement, Panama will immediately eliminate its tariffs on over 87 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial goods and on more than half of U.S. exports of agricultural goods, by value.  The Agreement also contains state of the art provisions to help protect and enforce intellectual property rights, reduce regulatory red tape, and eliminate regulatory barriers to U.S. exports.  The Agreement contains high standards for protecting labor rights, carrying out covered environmental agreements, and ensuring that key domestic labor and environmental laws are enforced, combined with strong remedies for non-compliance.  The Agreement is an important part of the Administration's efforts to spur economic growth, increase exports, and create jobs in the United States, while promoting our core values.  The Agreement forms an integral part of the Administration's larger strategy of doubling exports by the end of 2014.  It will strengthen our economic and political ties with Panama, support democracy and freedom, and contribute to greater competitiveness and economic growth in both countries.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports passage of S. 1944, which would continue and expand the payroll tax cut in place this year and put more money in the pockets of working and middle class Americans.  The President proposed this measure to the Congress as part of the American Jobs Act as a way to create jobs and spur economic growth.     By extending and expanding the payroll tax cut, the bill would cut in half the amount of payroll tax paid by employees and the self-employed on their wages and salaries for 2012.  Approximately 160 million workers would benefit from this tax cut, which would increase the size of the payroll tax cut for a family earning $50,000 from $1,000 in 2011 to $1,500 in 2012.  S. 1944 is paid for through a balanced and fair set of measures, including asking the Nation\u2019s wealthiest to contribute a small percentage more and modestly increasing the fees that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac charge mortgage lenders to guarantee repayment of new mortgage loans.  What is most important is putting Americans back to work, and S. 1944 would meet the test of paying for the extension and expansion of the payroll tax cuts in a way that is fair.     If the Congress does nothing, the typical working family will see its taxes go up by $1,000.  Independent economists have confirmed that these tax cuts for working families would add hundreds of thousands of jobs to the economy next year.  By enacting S. 1944, the Congress and the President can work together to create jobs, and the Administration urges prompt and favorable action.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports passage of S. 1917, which puts more money in the pockets of working and middle class Americans and provides tax cuts for small businesses to help them grow.  The President proposed these measures to the Congress as part of the American Jobs Act as a way to create jobs and spur economic growth.     By extending and expanding the payroll tax cut in place this year, the bill would cut in half the amount of payroll tax paid by employees and the self-employed on their wages and salaries for 2012.  Approximately 160 million workers would benefit from this tax cut, with the typical family earning $50,000 seeing more than $1,500 in additional take-home pay.    The bill would also cut in half the payroll tax paid by employers on the first $5 million of taxable payroll for 2012.  This provision would benefit all businesses, but would target the benefit to the 98 percent of firms with payrolls below the $5 million payroll threshold.  The bill would also completely eliminate the payroll tax paid on added workers and on wage increases for current workers for the first $12.5 million of an employer's increased taxable payroll for the 4th quarter of 2011 and the first $50 million in increased payroll for 2012.  This provision, also targeted to small businesses, would encourage firms to hire additional employees and raise wages for their current employees.  Finally, the bill provides that these tax cuts would have no effect whatsoever on balances in the Social Security Trust Funds.  S. 1917 is fully paid for through a surtax on those Americans making over $1 million per year. What is most important is putting Americans back to work.  S. 1917 would meet the test of paying for the extension and expansion of the payroll tax cuts in a way that is fair.

The DISCLOSE Act is a necessary measure to ensure transparency and accountability and to equip Americans with the tools to know who is attempting to influence the Nation's elections.    The Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 50 (2010), allowed unlimited corporate and special-interest money in elections, bringing about an era where corporations and other wealthy interests can exert vastly disproportionate influence, including through anonymous donations.  Under the DISCLOSE Act, any \"covered organization\" that spends $10,000 or more on campaign-related disbursements would be required to file a disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission within 24 hours of the expenditure, and to file a new report for each additional $10,000 or more that is spent.  In addition, the bill provides mechanisms to allow organizations to keep non-political donations private.     In the absence of the disclosure rules in S. 3369, corporations and wealthy individuals will continue to be able to shield their donations from disclosure.  Congress should act now to hold corporations and special interests that participate in the Nation's elections accountable to the American people.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2 because it would explode the deficit, raise costs for the American people and businesses, deny an estimated 32 million people health insurance, and take us back to the days when insurers could deny, limit or drop coverage for any American.  In a preliminary analysis of H.R. 2, the Congressional Budget Office found that repealing the law would increase the deficit by $230 billion in the first decade and roughly one-half of one percent of GDP, or over a trillion dollars, in the second decade; increase the number of uninsured Americans by 32 million; impose higher premiums on large firms; and cause consumers who buy coverage in the individual market to pay more out of pocket for fewer benefits.  Medicare\u2019s insolvency would be accelerated by repeal \u2013 the Medicare actuaries previously stated that the Affordable Care Act extended solvency by 12 years.  Repealing the Affordable Care Act would not only increase deficits in the coming decade, but would also significantly worsen the long-term fiscal burdens on American businesses and families.  When the Affordable Care Act provisions are fully in effect, insurance companies will no longer be able to discriminate against any American with a preexisting condition, charge women higher rates, or charge drastically higher premiums for older Americans.  H.R. 2 would eliminate the important patient protections, coverage expansions, affordability provisions, and fiscal savings in the Affordable Care Act.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2, he would veto it.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of the Rules Committee Print of H.R. 1315 because it would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in a manner that would expose American consumers and the Nation\u2019s economy to the same risks that led to the 2008 financial crisis.    H.R. 1315 would needlessly delay the transfer of Federal consumer financial protection responsibilities from seven other agencies to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) established by the Dodd-Frank Act, thus continuing to foster a fragmented approach to consumer financial protection.  In addition, the bill would seriously weaken the Bureau\u2019s decision-making power by making the head of the CFPB a five-person commission rather than a single Director, significantly limiting the Bureau\u2019s ability to effectively respond to the rapid changes in the dynamic consumer financial products and services market.  Finally, H.R. 1315 would compromise the independence of the CFPB by imposing unwarranted restrictions on a Bureau that is already subject to significant oversight.  The CFPB is the only banking regulator whose rules can be set aside by a council made up of other Federal agencies.  H.R. 1315 would go beyond this already stringent limitation by making it easier for the Financial Stability Oversight Council to set aside CFPB rules and regulations, which would significantly impede the Bureau\u2019s ability to protect American consumers from unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices.   H.R. 1315 would significantly interfere with the CFPB\u2019s charge to make consumer financial markets operate more efficiently and effectively, facilitate innovation in the marketplace, protect consumers\u2019 interests, and ensure that consumers have the information they need to make prudent financial decisions.  The President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend that the President veto any bill, including H.R. 1315, that makes the Nation\u2019s economy more vulnerable to another devastating financial crisis by undermining the core reforms included in the Dodd-Frank Act.    * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.J.

The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means and reducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  That is why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, supports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, and meets the commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their circumstances.    While overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of ongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership on the Nation\u2019s long-term fiscal picture, the bill provides insufficient funding for a number of programs in a way that undermines core government functions and investments key to economic growth and job creation.  Programs adversely affected by the bill include:  Transportation Security Administration Passenger Security Fee.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee bill fails to reform the aviation passenger security fee.    State and Local Grant Programs.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee bill insufficiently funds the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s State and local grants, including Assistance to Firefighter Grants.  The funding level provided will adversely impact the entire portfolio of preparedness grants to State, local, tribal jurisdictions, and the transportation sector.  Further, funding the SAFER program at the Committee\u2019s level would reduce the number of firefighters funded by approximately 2,200 positions.  Although large balances remain available in these programs, State and local governments depend on this funding to support ongoing homeland security prevention and preparedness programs and ensure that all levels of government have the capacity to adequately respond to threats.  The Administration supports and appreciates the flexibility given to the Secretary to allocate limited homeland security grant funding to those areas deemed most critical.  Science and Technology Research Funding.  The funding for research and development provided in the Committee\u2019s bill would limit the domestic investment in developing new capabilities to efficiently meet the demands of current and emerging homeland security threats through the elimination of more than 144 research projects in areas such as biological and explosives detection, advanced cyber security, and interoperability.  Without domestic investment in new technologies and solutions targeted specifically at the homeland security threat, the United States will become increasingly dependent on foreign countries for any advances in homeland security technology.   Coast Guard Fast Response Cutter and Shore Projects.  The Committee bill provides insufficient funds for key acquisition programs that will allow for the recapitalization of aging assets. The level of funding provided for Fast Response Cutters will unnecessarily delay production and increase future costs by delaying purchase of the proprietary specifications that are needed to replace aging patrol boats. Further, the funding level for shore and housing projects will deprive Coast Guard families of suitable housing in duty stations where housing market shortfalls exist and eliminate high priority shore projects that directly affect operations.  Transportation Security Administration.  The funding level in the Committee bill for the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s Federal Air Marshal Service will result in either reduced staffing in 2012 or curtailed domestic mission coverage on priority aviation flights. Further, the funding provided will not permit the deployment of 275 additional advanced imaging technology systems, which is an important tool for detecting both metallic and non-metallic threats as part of the aviation passenger screening process.  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF).  The Administration will continue to closely monitor Disaster Relief Fund balances and work with the Congress to ensure Fund solvency.  The Administration, however, strongly objects to proposed language that would direct the President to submit a budget amendment or supplemental appropriations request with associated offsets when the Fund dips below a certain threshold.  The Administration would view this provision as advisory.   Headquarters Consolidation and Operation.  The Committee bill would delay the consolidation of the Department of Homeland Security headquarters by at least two years, resulting in higher lease costs and will mean the loss of construction efficiencies and increased future construction costs. The funding provided in the bill for the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management would result in a reduction-in-force.  The Administration also has a number of serious constitutional concerns.  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions of section 537 that limit the use of funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee transfers.  Although the Administration opposes the release of detainees within the United States, section 537 is a dangerous and extraordinary challenge to critical Executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute detainees, based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests.   It unnecessarily constrains the Nation's counterterrorism efforts and would undermine national security, particularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 option for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have leveraged the flexibility and strength of this country\u2019s Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous terrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an essential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available option.    The Administration strongly opposes any inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.

The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4402, which, though vaguely worded, would undermine and remove the environmental safeguards, for, at a minimum, almost all types of hardrock mines on Federal lands. Notwithstanding the title and the stated purpose of the legislation, H.R. 4402, as reported by the House Natural Resources Committee, is drafted in such a manner as to cover virtually all hardrock mining on Federal lands.  Protection of the public through sound Federal decision-making would be circumvented by the bill's provisions, which include, among other things, the elimination of appropriate reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act and the circumvention of public involvement in and the formulation of alternatives to any mining proposal.  The Administration strongly supports the development of rare earth elements and other critical minerals, but rejects the notion that their development is incongruent with environmental protection and public involvement in agency decision-making.   The legislation also undermines existing law calling for the multiple uses of public lands by placing mining interests above all other uses.  This change has the potential to threaten hunting, fishing, recreation and other activities which create jobs and sustain local economies across the country.  Furthermore, the Administration opposes the legislation's severe restrictions on judicial review.  While the legislation purports to limit litigation, its extremely short statute of limitations and vague constraints on the scope of prospective relief that a court may issue are likely to have the opposite effect.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5326, making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.    Last summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  The BCA created a framework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that would bring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national priorities.  Departing from the bipartisan agreement reached in the BCA and departing from these caps, the House of Representatives put forward a topline discretionary funding level for FY 2013 that, for example, would cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially seniors, veterans, and children \u2013 as well as degrade many of the basic Government services on which the American people rely such as air traffic control and law enforcement.  In addition, these cuts were made in the context of a budget that fails the test of balance, fairness, and shared responsibility by giving millionaires and billionaires a tax cut and paying for it through deep cuts, including to discretionary programs.    Taking this into account, passing H.R. 5326 at its current funding level would mean that when the Congress constructs other appropriations bills, it would necessitate significant and harmful cuts to critical national priorities such as education, research and development, job training, and health care.  Furthermore, the bill undermines key investments in resource management, export promotion, community safety, access to justice, and space flight.  Investing in these areas is critical to the Nation's economic growth, security, and global competitiveness.  The Administration also strongly objects to the inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.   If the President were presented with H.R. 5326, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Commerce  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The Administration strongly opposes the $93 million reduction in funding from the FY 2013 Budget request for NOAA.  This cut would impact negatively NOAA's ability to support the Nation's fisheries and oceans stewardship programs such as protected species programs, which would be cut by $16 million  below the FY 2013 Budget request and $20 million below the FY 2012 enacted level.  Decreased funding for Protected Species Research and Management could lead to delays in permitting or consultations and result in the development of less precise measures, which could have economic impacts on coastal industries such as fisheries, agriculture, oil and gas development, and coastal construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for mission-critical satellite programs.    Census Bureau.  The Administration opposes the $92 million reduction from the FY 2013 Budget request.  The cut below the FY 2012 enacted level threatens the Bureau's ability to implement Economic Census data collection activities that peak in FY 2013, hindering the successful development of critical benchmarks for Gross Domestic Product estimates.  The bill also does not provide sufficient funding for 2020 Decennial Census Planning, adversely impacting Census research and testing activities that inform the development of an accurate and cost-efficient decennial census.   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The Administration opposes the decision to not include funding for the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC).  The continued Government support of NSTIC pilot projects, as proposed in the President's FY 2013 Budget, is required to demonstrate new identity management solutions that will protect individuals, businesses, and agencies from cyber-crimes.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for NIST intramural research and manufacturing initiatives.    International Trade Administration (ITA).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $517 million for ITA, which plays an important role in increasing U.S. exports.  The Administration strongly encourages the full request be provided for the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center and SelectUSA initiatives, which will help protect against unfair trade practices and promote investment and jobs.  Without the requested funding, ITA would have to dramatically scale back its export promotion and counseling efforts, both domestically and overseas.  This would result in fewer additional American exports, particularly by small businesses, and fewer new American jobs.     Department of Justice  State and Local Assistance.  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided for the Community Oriented Policing Services Hiring Grants Program, which is $217 million below the FY 2013 Budget request.  This reduced funding level would result in the loss of approximately 1,200 police hires/rehires, including veterans.  In addition, some communities seriously impacted by crime would not be able to support enough police officers to effectively respond.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fund the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program at the requested level of $430 million, which will provide much-needed assistance to help State and local law enforcement address crime.   Executive Office of the President  Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).  The Administration opposes the reduction from the FY 2013 Budget request for USTR.  The bill does not fully fund the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center, a coordinated interagency approach to enhance trade enforcement which levels the playing field for U.S. workers and businesses.    2  Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the FY 2013 Budget request of $5.85 million.  This funding enables OSTP to leverage its scientific and technical expertise to address the Nation's science and technology challenges.   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided for the commercial crew program, which is $330 million below the FY 2013 Budget request, as well as restrictive report language that would eliminate competition in the program.  This would increase the time the United States will be required to rely solely on foreign providers to transport American astronauts to and from the space station.  While the Administration appreciates the overall funding level provided to NASA, the bill provides some NASA programs with unnecessary increases at the expense of other important initiatives.  National Science Foundation (NSF)  The Administration appreciates the funding level of $7.3 billion provided for NSF, which is $300 million above the FY 2012 enacted level.  The funding would support over 400 additional research and education awards compared to FY 2012.   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)  The Administration is concerned about the Committee's funding level for EEOC, which is $7 million less than the FY 2013 Budget request.  Funding at this level would prevent EEOC from filling critical investigator positions lost through attrition, which would increase EEOC's backlog and weaken its ability to enforce Federal laws that protect individuals from discrimination based on their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetic information.  Legal Services Corporation (LSC)  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided in the bill for LSC, which is $74 million below the FY 2013 Budget request.  At this funding level, tens of thousands of low-income Americans, including many military families and veterans, would be denied assistance with civil legal problems, impacting their ability to receive fair treatment in the courts.   Riders  The Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders that have no place in funding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill:  Reasonable Factors Other Than Age Rule.  Preventing the implementation of this Rule under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act would prevent the EEOC from bringing its regulations into line with Supreme Court decisions and perpetuate uncertainty surrounding the defenses to an age discrimination claim, resulting in inconsistent litigation outcomes for both individuals and employers.  3   Prohibition on Multiple Sales of Rifles Reporting Requirement.  Preventing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from requiring licensed firearms dealers in four border States to report information on the sale of multiple rifles or shotguns to the same person would hamper efforts to address the problem of illegal gun trafficking along the Southwest Border and in Mexico.  Authority to Enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The Americans with Disabilities Act is crucial to protecting core civil rights principles and ensuring that people with disabilities have access to everyday activities and can participate in all aspects of society.  Weakening civil rights enforcement under the Americans with Disabilities Act sets a dangerous precedent.  Constitutional Concerns   Several provisions in the bill, particularly sections 509, 520, and 534, could raise constitutional concerns in certain applications by intruding upon the President's constitutional authority over international diplomacy.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns.   In addition, the Administration objects to and has constitutional concerns about section 529 of the bill.  This provision's restrictions on the transfer of detainees to the United States in the context of an ongoing armed conflict may interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and to make important foreign policy and national security determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers should occur.  Such restrictions or interferences would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *   4  ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J.

The Administration is committed to supporting the right of workers to join and participate in a union and bargain for fair wages, benefits and a safe workplace.  These rights are fundamental to better conditions for American workers and to an open, just, economically fair and prosperous society.  S.J. Res. 36 attacks these bedrock American values.

Without timely passage of a clean extension, all of FAA\u2019s capital accounts (Grants-in-Aid for Airports, Facilities and Equipment, and Research, Engineering, and Development) would be shut down, and approximately 4,000 employees would be furloughed.  FAA\u2019s ability to award new grants, including for infrastructure upgrades at airports across the country, as well as to move forward with vital testing and implementation of the Next Generation air traffic control system, would come to a stop.    * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes S.

Instead, we must\u2013 as members of both parties have done in the past \u2013move beyond politics as usual and find bipartisan common ground to restore us to a sustainable fiscal path.  S. J. Res. 10 would set a severe and unrealistic spending cap that would undercut the Federal Government\u2019s ability to meet its core commitments to seniors, middle class families and the most vulnerable, while reducing our ability to invest in our future.  This cap could result in severe cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security that are growing due to the retirement of the baby boomers, putting at risk the retirement security of millions of Americans, and it could result in significant cuts to education, research and development, and other programs critical to growing our economy and winning the future.    S. J. Res. 10 also would impose serious risks for our economy.  It risks accelerating economic downturns by requiring the government to raise taxes and cut spending in the face of a contraction, which would accelerate job losses.  The President proposed a balanced approach to restore fiscal sustainability and in a way that does not slow the Federal Government's ability to initiate actions that help stabilize the economy and keep future recessions from becoming worse.  By contrast, under S. J. Res. 10, a minority in a single house of Congress could block the will of the majority and the Executive to waive its provisions when our country faces a downturn.  If S. J. Res. 10 had been in effect in recent years, such a minority in one house would have been able to prevent efforts to override the requirement for tax increases or spending cuts, risking an even deeper contraction and pushing the economy into a second Great Depression.   Further, S. J. Res. 10 ducks responsibility and does not take the Nation's fiscal challenges head-on.  Rather, it could result in handing the hard decisions that our elected representatives in the Congress should be making to the Federal Courts.  S. J. Res. 10 is not a solution to the Nation's deficits.

This legislation makes it clear that Members of Congress may not engage in insider trading.  It will help to limit the corrosive influence of money in politics and ensure that the Congress is playing by the same set of rules as everyone else, an important component of the President\u2019s Blueprint for an America Built to Last.    S. 2038 clarifies that Members and employees of Congress are subject to the prohibitions arising under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s Rule 10b-5, including the prohibition on insider trading.  In particular, it makes clear that Members and employees of Congress owe a duty arising from their position of trust and confidence not to use nonpublic information obtained by virtue of their position for personal benefit.  It also requires reporting of various transactions, including purchases and sales of stock, within 30 days.  In addition, S. 2038 requires the Comptroller General in consultation with the Congressional Research Service to prepare a report for submission to the Congress on the role of political intelligence in the financial markets.  This report would address, among other things, the effects of the sale of political intelligence on the financial markets, related legal and ethical considerations, and the merits of imposing disclosure requirements on those who engage in political intelligence activities.    As the President said in his State of the Union message, it is critical that the Congress take steps to restore the American people\u2019s trust in Washington.  Members of Congress should not be able to trade stocks based on nonpublic information gleaned on Capitol Hill.  The Administration believes this bipartisan legislation is an important first step to prevent Members of Congress from profiting from their positions and calls for swift passage.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R 2018 because it would significantly undermine the Clean Water Act (CWA) and could adversely affect public health, the economy, and the environment.    Under the CWA, one of the Nation\u2019s most successful and effective environmental laws, the Federal Government acts to ensure safe levels of water quality across the country through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Since the enactment of the CWA in 1972, the Federal Government has protected the waterways our citizens depend on by using its checks and balances authority to review and adjust key State water pollution control decisions, where necessary, to assure that they reflect up to date science, comply with the law, and protect downstream water users in other States.  H.R. 2018 would roll back the key provisions of the CWA that have been the underpinning of 40 years of progress in making the Nation\u2019s waters fishable, swimmable, and drinkable.      H.R. 2018 could limit efforts to safeguard communities by removing the Federal Government\u2019s authority to take action when State water quality standards are not protective of public health.  In addition, it would restrict EPA\u2019s authority to take action when it finds that a State\u2019s CWA permit or permit program is inadequate and would shorten EPA\u2019s review and collaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers on permits for dredged or fill material.  All of these changes could result in adverse impacts to human health, the economy, and the environment through increased pollution and degradation of water bodies that serve as venues for recreation and tourism, and that provide drinking water sources and habitat for fish and wildlife.   H.R. 2018 would disrupt the carefully constructed complementary CWA roles for EPA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and States in protecting water quality.  It also could eliminate EPA\u2019s ability to protect water quality and public health in downstream States from actions in upstream States, and could increase the number of lawsuits challenging State permits. In sum, H.R. 2018 would upset the CWA\u2019s balanced approach to improve water quality across the Nation, risking the public health and economic benefits of cleaner waters.

H.R. 4078, the Regulatory Freeze for Jobs Act, would undermine critical public health and safety protections, introduce needless complexity and uncertainty in agency decision-making, and interfere with agency performance of statutory mandates.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4078. When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and well understood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  This Administration is committed to a regulatory system that is informed by science, cost-justified, and consistent with economic growth.  Through Executive Order and the direction of the President, agencies must also ensure that they take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.  Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased public participation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a regulatory retrospective review.  Through Executive Orders 13579 and 13610, the Administration also has taken important steps to promote systematic retrospective review of regulations by all agencies.  Collectively, these requirements promote flexible, commonsense, cost-effective regulation.  Passage of H.R. 4078 would seriously undermine the existing framework.  H.R. 4078 would also add layers of procedural burdens that would interfere with agency performance of statutory mandates, unnecessarily delay important public health and safety protections, and undermine and potentially delay important environmental reviews.  For example, H.R. 4078 would create excessively complex permitting processes that would hamper economic growth.  It would also spawn excessive regulatory litigation, and introduce redundant processes for litigation settlements.  It also addresses numerous problems that do not exist, such as a moratorium on \"midnight\" rules.  In these ways and many others, the Regulatory Freeze for Jobs Act would impede the ability of agencies to protect public health, welfare, safety, and our environment, as well as to promote economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.

The Administration's recently announced five-year strategy for offshore oil and gas leasing makes areas containing more than 75 percent of estimated, technically recoverable oil and gas resources in our oceans available for exploration and development -- including all of the highest resource areas on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  This plan was developed following extensive input from the public, industry, States, Tribes, and others, and incorporates lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  H.R. 6082 would require the Department of the Interior to open a number of new areas on the OCS.  This action would be directed without Secretarial discretion to determine whether those areas are appropriate for leasing through balanced consideration of factors such as resource potential, State and local views and concerns, and the maturity of infrastructure needed to support oil and gas development, including in the event of an oil spill.  The bill would mandate OCS lease sales along the east and west coast and elsewhere without regard for significant issues such as State and local concerns and impacts on important fishing areas and with inadequate consideration of military use conflicts.    The bill also would establish unworkable deadlines and substantive and procedural limitations on important environmental review and other analysis that is critical to complying with laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Clean Water Act.

The Agreement will level the playing field for U.S. businesses, workers, farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, investors and service providers by offering them unprecedented access to Korea's nearly $1 trillion economy, and meets the negotiating principles and objectives set out by Congress in the Trade Act of 2002.  The Agreement eliminates tariffs on over 95 percent of U.S. exports of industrial and consumer goods to Korea within the first five years and, together with the agreement entered into through an exchange of letters in February 2011, addresses the concerns of American automakers and workers regarding the lack of a level playing field in Korea's auto market.  The Agreement also ensures that almost two-thirds of current U.S. agricultural exports will enter Korea duty-free immediately.

The Nation's tax code does too little to encourage job creation and investment in the United States while allowing firms to benefit from incentives to locate production and jobs overseas.  This bill can help attract and keep jobs in the United States by providing a 20 percent general business tax credit for eligible expenditures associated with bringing jobs back, which is paid for by preventing firms from receiving tax breaks for deducting expenses associated with outsourcing.  Senate passage of this bill is consistent with the Administration's commitment to support economic growth, job creation, and business investment in the United States, and serves to discourage outsourcing in all sectors of the economy, but particularly in our manufacturing sector.  Following a decade in which the United States lost over 5 million manufacturing jobs, the Nation has begun to make progress.  Over the past 28 months, the U.S. manufacturing sector has added roughly 500,000 new jobs, the fastest pace of manufacturing job growth since 1995.

The Regulatory Accountability Act would impose unprecedented procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from performing their statutory responsibilities.  It would also create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty and increase costs for businesses, as well as state, tribal, and local governments, and further impede the implementation of commonsense protections for the American public. The Regulatory Accountability Act would impose unnecessary new procedures on agencies and invite frivolous litigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, it must already adhere to the requirements of the statute that it is implementing.  In many cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the particular rule or regulation, and it often prescribes the process the agency must follow.  Agencies must also adhere to the robust and well understood procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, and major rules are subject to the requirements of other Federal statutes such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  Lastly, final regulations are subject to review by the Federal courts to ensure that agencies satisfy the substantive and procedural requirements of all applicable statutes and consider input from the relevant stakeholders. Passage of H.R. 3010 would replace this time-honored framework with layers of additional procedural requirements that would seriously undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory mandates.  It would require cumbersome \u201cformal\u201d rulemaking for a new category of rules, for which agencies would have to conduct quasi-adjudicatory proceedings.

H.R. 910 would also increase the Nation's dependence on oil and other fossil fuels as well as contradict the scientific consensus on climate change.  The CAA gives EPA the necessary tools to protect our families from a wide variety of harmful pollutants that cause asthma and lung disease \u2013 especially in children.  Weakening these standards would allow more pollution in the air we breathe and threaten the health of Americans across the country.  A recent report by EPA shows how important this landmark law has been in protecting public health.  In 2010 alone, just one part of the CAA prevented:  \u2022  160,000 premature deaths;  \u2022  130,000 heart attacks;  \u2022  More than 100,000 hospital visits by preventing millions of cases of respiratory problems, including bronchitis and asthma.  It enhanced productivity by preventing millions of lost workdays, and kept kids healthy and in school, avoiding millions of lost school days due to respiratory illness and other diseases caused or exacerbated by air pollution.  Since 1970, the CAA has reduced key air pollutants that cause smog and particulate pollution by more than 60 percent.  At the same time the economy has more than tripled.  And since the CAA Amendments in 1990, electricity production is up and prices are stable.  In 2009, electric utilities delivered 33 percent more electricity to U.S. households and businesses than in 1990, while nationwide electricity prices remained essentially unchanged.  Over its 40-year span, the benefits of the CAA \u2013 in the form of longer lives, healthier kids, greater workforce productivity, and ecosystem protections \u2013 outweigh the costs by more than 30 to one.  Passage of H.R. 910 would also block important policy measures that enable the CAA to achieve additional societal benefits related to carbon pollution.  For example, the bill would block EPA's involvement in the historic, bipartisan Federal program to promote vehicle fuel economy standards for Model Years 2017-2025.  This program will reduce oil consumption, provide significant savings to American consumers at the pump, and limit pollution from tailpipe emissions.  Further, H.R. 910 would second guess the widely-accepted scientific consensus that  carbon pollution is at increasingly dangerous concentrations and is contributing to the threat of climate change.  This could create uncertainty around the requirements which are currently in effect for the Model Year 2012-2016 vehicle standards.  Finally, H.R. 910 would contradict public health experts and scientists and strip EPA of its authority to develop sensible standards for currently unchecked carbon pollution, and thus prevent EPA from following its statutory obligations as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  If the President is presented with this legislation, which would seriously roll back the CAA authority, harm Americans\u2019 health by taking away our ability to decrease carbon pollution, and undercut fuel efficiency standards that will save Americans money at the pump while decreasing our dependence on oil, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *    2  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means and reducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  That is why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, supports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, meets the commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their circumstances, and provides for our national security.   While overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of ongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership on the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, the Administration has concerns regarding the level of resources the bill would provide for a number of programs in a way that undermines core government functions, investments key to economic growth and job creation, as well as national security.  Programs adversely affected by the bill include:  Department of Energy (DOE)  Clean Energy Research and Development (R&D).  The level of funding provided for R&D of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies would undermine the ability of the United States to develop a clean energy economy and create jobs for the future.  By reducing funds for key programs including Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy, the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program, and the Office of Science, the bill places at risk U.S. competitiveness in technologies and expanding markets such as electric vehicles and batteries, new \"drop-in\" hydrocarbon biofuels, cost-saving energy-efficient systems for homes and businesses, advanced manufacturing materials and processes, and cost-competitive solar energy and offshore wind power.  Climate Research.  The funding level for the Office of Science's Biological and Environmental Research program would hamper the Administration\u2019s efforts to conduct and support scientific research on the relationship between energy production and the environment.  The Administration also strongly disagrees with the Committee Report suggestion that climate and atmospheric research are unrelated to DOE's core basic science mission.    Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program (Title XVII).  The bill significantly reduces credit subsidy budget authority for the Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program, which helps finance renewable energy and efficient end-use projects.  The bill also does not provide any additional loan volume authority for nuclear power projects or any of the requested funds for a new Better Building Pilot Loan Guarantee Program.  These programs are an important part of the Nation's efforts to deploy innovative clean energy technologies, and these reductions may slow progress toward a  clean energy future.  Yucca Mountain License.  Continued funding of the Yucca Mountain license application will divert funds from the Nation\u2019s efforts to advance fuel cycle technologies and develop waste management options.  The Administration has established a Blue Ribbon Commission to inform the development of a new strategy for nuclear waste management and disposal.    Environmental Management.  The level of resources in the bill may affect DOE's ability to meet its goals for cleaning up legacy waste from its nuclear programs. Nuclear Posture Review Goals and Maintaining a Safe, Secure and Effective Nuclear Deterrent. The Administration objects to the funding reduction in Title III, Weapons Activities, which will delay the achievement of a number of important Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) goals.  The full request supports the Administration's commitment to modernization of the nuclear weapons complex made in the NPR and reaffirmed as part of the New START treaty ratification process.    Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation.  The Administration objects to funding reductions in Title III, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation in the Fissile Materials Disposition and Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) Reactor Conversion.  These reductions will undermine U.S. ability to begin disposing plutonium in 2018 and delay efforts to reduce usage of HEU in nuclear reactors worldwide.  Corps of Engineers (Corps)   Construction and New Starts.  The bill provides excess funding for the Corps' construction program while also underfunding some of the highest priority construction projects, including the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program, a nationally significant effort that includes the Everglades.  The bill's \"no new start\" prohibition would preclude funding the limited number of priority new starts in the President's Budget, including an important new program to reverse damage to the coastal Louisiana ecosystem and a study called for by the Congress to examine flood risks nationwide in order to improve existing programs.    Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation  Indian Water Rights Settlements.  Absorbing funding for Indian water settlements in the Bureau's primary funding account would limit the Bureau's ability to fund other high priority programs, such as its water conservation activities.  San Joaquin Rescission.  Rescinding unobligated balances from the San Joaquin Restoration Fund would undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts.  Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration  High Speed Rail Balances.  The Administration opposes the rescission of unobligated balances that have already been competitively awarded to projects across the country.  These projects will create jobs and make needed improvements to the intercity passenger rail network.  Rescinding funds now would significantly disrupt States' planning and construction efforts, which count on their committed amounts.   2  The bill includes the following problematic policy and language issues:   Clean Water Act.  Section 109 of the bill would stop an important Administration effort to provide clarity around which water bodies are covered by the Clean Water Act.  The Administration\u2019s work in this area will help to protect the public health and economic benefits provided to the American public by clean water, while also bringing greater certainty to business planning and investment and reducing an ongoing loss of wetlands and other sensitive aquatic resources.  The existing regulations were the subject of two recent Supreme Court cases, in which the Court itself indicated the need for greater regulatory clarity regarding the appropriate scope of the Clean Water Act jurisdiction.   Fighting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.  The Administration is concerned with sections 606 and 607 of the bill and looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve the intended purpose of protecting the interest of the Nation's taxpayers, which is consistent with the Administration's efforts to fight fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal contracts, grants, and other Federal assistance.  Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program (Title XVII).  Section 312 of the bill, requiring release of pre-decisional, business-sensitive information, could negatively impact the Title XVII loan program, potential applicants, and related private-sector entities.  Not protecting business-sensitive information of applicants to the program could have significant market implications for the companies and could encourage \"gaming the system\" by applicants, including by discouraging them from sharing information with the Department which is critical to ensuring the Government establishes accurate cost estimates.

Over that same period of time, the economy has grown over 200 percent while emissions of key pollutants have decreased more than 60 percent.  Forty years of clean air regulation has shown that a strong economy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.  S.J.Res. 27 would undermine this progress by blocking the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), which would reduce harmful air pollution from power plants that threatens the health of downwind communities, especially the health of children, seniors, and other vulnerable populations.  The CSAPR responds to a 2008 court decision directing EPA to replace the prior Administration's rule with a new rule to address the transport of air pollution across State boundaries.

H.R. 4480 would threaten energy security and broader national security by attaching conditions to the drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) that could hinder the President's ability to respond appropriately and lawfully to a disruption in the Nation's energy supply.  Linking a drawdown of the SPR with the leasing of Federal lands for energy production is entirely without rational basis, either temporally, spatially, or in terms of the Nation's energy needs.

At the same time as the House is advancing tax cuts that benefit the most fortunate Americans, H.R. 5652 would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle class and vulnerable Americans \u2013 especially seniors, veterans, and children.  The sequester included in the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) included mutually disagreeable cuts to both defense and non-defense funding.  These cuts would have destructive effects on national security; on important domestic investments such as education, research and development, and rebuilding the Nation's crumbling infrastructure; and on core government programs from air traffic control to law enforcement.  The threat of these destructive cuts under the BCA was intended to be a mechanism to force action by the Congress on deficit reduction.  The President has made clear that the Congress can and must act to avoid the sweeping impacts of the sequester by passing a balanced deficit reduction package.  Last fall, the Administration provided a blueprint for the Congress to do so.  And in his 2013 Budget, the President proposed a comprehensive balanced deficit reduction package that would ensure the Nation lives within its means and, including legislation signed into law last year, reduces the deficit by $4 trillion while supporting job creation and long-term economic growth.  This package would achieve more than enough deficit reduction to avoid the sequester.  In contrast, the approach advanced in this bill only addresses a portion of the pending sequester, and does so in a way that imposes far greater cuts than the sequester would entail.  The bill would break the agreement on discretionary spending made in last summer's budget agreement; advancing the House Budget Resolution's approach to increase defense spending and reduce non-defense spending relative to the levels agreed to in the BCA.  Moreover, it would do nothing to address the reductions in discretionary spending and sequesters in mandatory programs after 2013.  The bill relies entirely on spending cuts that impose a particular burden on the middle-class and the most vulnerable among us, while doing nothing to raise revenue from the most affluent.  Rather than pursuing a comprehensive, balanced deficit reduction package to replace the sequester, H.R. 5652 undermines the intent of the BCA to bring both sides to compromise by proposing a short-term, one-sided solution.  This approach sharply undermines critical domestic priorities, such as efforts to prevent hunger and support low-income families and communities; to expand health care access and implement the Affordable Care Act; to protect consumers and implement the Wall Street Reform Act; and to support homeowners struggling to stay in their homes.

By contrast, under S. J. Res. 24, a minority in a single house of Congress could block the will of the majority and the Executive to waive its provisions when our country faces a downturn.  If S. J.

F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Propulsion System:  The Administration strongly objects to the language in section 215, which limits the obligation or expenditure of funds for performance improvements to the F-35 Lightning II propulsion system unless there is competitive development and production of such a propulsion system.  As the test program unfolds, some improvements are likely to be needed.  And this would result in the continued development of an extra engine that adds significant extra costs to the program for something the Administration and the Department of Defense (DoD) have determined is not needed and would destabilize the F-35 program when it is beginning to stabilize.  Additionally, section 215 would delay development of the main engine and affect the viability of the short take off and vertical landing variant.  If the final bill presented to the President includes funding or a legislative direction to continue an extra engine program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto.  The Administration also strongly objects to section 252, which requires the Secretary to store  and preserve the property developed under the F136 program \u2013 a termination that ended an unnecessary and extravagant expense, particularly during this period of fiscal restraint.  The legislation would constitute a new requirement for the preservation and storage of over 250,000 pieces of Government property located with hundreds of suppliers and add costs for preserving and storing that property.    Limitations on Nuclear Force Reductions and Nuclear Employment Strategy:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1055 and 1056, which impinge on the President\u2019s authority to implement the New START Treaty and to set U.S. nuclear weapons policy.  In particular, section 1055 would set onerous conditions on the Administration\u2019s ability to implement the Treaty, as well as to retire, dismantle, or eliminate non-deployed nuclear weapons.  Among these conditions is the completion and operation of the next generation of nuclear facilities, which is not expected until the mid-2020s.  The effect of this section would be to preclude dismantlement of weapons in excess of military needs.  Additionally, it would significantly increase stewardship and management costs and divert key resources from our critical stockpile sustainment efforts and delay completion of programs necessary to support the long-term safety, security, and reliability of our nuclear deterrent.  Further, section 1056 raises constitutional concerns as it appears to encroach on the President\u2019s authority as Commander in Chief to set nuclear employment policy \u2013 a right exercised by every president in the nuclear age from both parties.  If the final bill presented to the President includes these provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto.  Detainee Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1034 which, in purporting to affirm the conflict, would effectively recharacterize its scope and would risk creating confusion regarding applicable standards.  At a minimum, this is an issue that merits more extensive consideration before possible inclusion.  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions that limit the use of authorized funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee transfers and to the provisions that would legislate Executive branch processes for periodic review of detainee status and regarding prosecution of detainees.  Although the Administration opposes the release of detainees within the United States, Section 1039 is a dangerous and unprecedented challenge to critical Executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute detainees, based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  It unnecessarily constrains our Nation's counterterrorism efforts and would undermine our national security, particularly where our Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 option for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties \u2013 including Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush \u2013 have leveraged the flexibility and strength of our Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous terrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an essential element of our counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available option.  The certification requirement in section 1040, restricting transfers to foreign countries, interferes with the authority of the Executive branch to make important foreign policy and national security determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers should occur.  The Administration must have the ability to act swiftly and to have broad flexibility in conducting its negotiations with foreign countries.  Section 1036 undermines the system of periodic review established by the President\u2019s March 7, 2011, Executive Order by substituting a rigid system of review that could limit the advice and expertise of critical intelligence and law enforcement professionals, undermining the Executive branch\u2019s ability to ensure that these decisions are informed by all available information and protect the full spectrum of our national security interests.  It also unnecessarily interferes with DoD\u2019s ability to 2  manage detention operations.  Section 1042 is problematic and unnecessary, as there already is robust coordination between the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and the Intelligence Community on terrorism-related cases, and this provision would undermine, rather than enhance, this coordination by requiring institutions to assume unfamiliar roles and could cause delays in taking into custody individuals who pose imminent threats to the nation\u2019s safety.  If the final bill presented to the President includes these provisions that challenge critical Executive branch authority, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend a veto.  Attempts to Prevent, Delay, or Undermine the Repeal of \"Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\":  On December 22, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, in order to strengthen our national security, enhance military readiness, and uphold the fundamental American principles of fairness and equality that warfighters defend around the world.  As required by that statute, DoD is diligently working to prepare the necessary policies and regulations and conducting educational briefings to implement the repeal.  Should it be determined, as required by the statute, that the implementation is consistent with the standards of military readiness and effectiveness, unit cohesion, and military recruiting and retention, then the President, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will send forward the required certification.  The Administration strongly objects to any legislative attempts (such as section 533) to directly or indirectly undermine, prevent, or delay the implementation of the repeal, as such efforts create uncertainty for servicemembers and their families.    Military Regulations Regarding Marriage:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 534 and 535, believes that section 3 of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is discriminatory, and supports DOMA\u2019s repeal.    Limitation on Funds to Provide Russian Federation with Access to U.S. Missile Defense Technology and International Agreements Relating to Missile Defense:  The Administration strongly objects to the following two sections: (1) section 1228 would prohibit the provision to the Russian Federation of a range of missile defense data, when the appropriate reciprocal exchange of such data may improve the ability of the United States and NATO to provide effective missile defenses of our military forces and other citizens; and (2) section 1229 would unnecessarily impede the Administration's ability to conduct discussions with the Russian Federation on missile defense matters both bilaterally and in the NATO context, and would be impractical to implement, for example by requiring that the Administration report on all \"suggestions\" made by representatives of the Russian Federation in government to government contacts (which could include the legislative branch).  Among other things, section 1229 raises constitutional concerns, as it appears to encroach on the President\u2019s exclusive authority to determine the time, scope, and objectives of international negotiations and to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive diplomatic discussions.  Extended Deterrent in Europe:  The Administration strongly objects, including on constitutional grounds, to the elements of section 1230 that would limit the President\u2019s ability to determine military requirements in Europe, conduct diplomacy, and negotiate treaties.  The Administration also objects to this section\u2019s limitation on Administration efforts to address tactical nuclear weapons, a step called for in the Senate\u2019s Resolution of Ratification of the New START Treaty and a priority of U.S. arms control policy.  Further, the Administration notes this section would inhibit our ability to function within NATO.   3  Limitation on Force Management Efficiencies:  The Administration strongly objects to provisions such as sections 1094, 2307, 2705, and 2862 that would limit the Secretary\u2019s discretion in determining and executing force management efficiencies.  For example, section 1094 would require the Secretary of the Navy to maintain a minimum force of 10 aircraft carrier air-wings and a dedicated headquarters for each.  However, a reduction from 10 to 9 aircraft carrier air wings staff is projected to save DoD approximately $22.2 million over five years (FYs 2012-2016) and meets the needs of the Navy which has no operational need for a 10th carrier air wing.  Additionally, sections 2307, 2705, and 2862, requiring additional study and notice of proposed disestablishment, closure or realignment of certain military installations, or the reduction in the number of military personnel and waiting times prior to execution, impedes the Secretary\u2019s ability to make and implement force management decisions that would ensure scarce resources are directed to the highest priorities for the warfighter.      Unified Medical Command:  The Administration strongly objects to section 711, which would require the President to create a new unified combatant command for medical operations.  DoD will shortly complete a study on how to best deliver high-quality medical care to servicemembers and their families in an effective and cost-efficient manner.  Among the options this study will consider is a joint medical command similar to this provision; however, this section presumes the outcome of the study and of decisions to be made by DoD leadership on this important subject.    Designation of Main Propulsion System of the Next-Generation Long Range Strike Bomber Aircraft as Major Subprogram:  The Administration objects to language in section 220, which would require the Secretary of Defense to designate the main propulsion system of the next-generation long-range strike bomber as a major subprogram and require a competitive acquisition strategy.  A major tenet of the new bomber program is to maximize the use of existing engine systems.  The approach needs to rely on minor modifications to existing engines and give the prime contractors freedom to select the engine that is right for their design.  Moreover, the prime contractor\u2019s design concepts may differ so widely that it would be impractical to have a separate engine competition and then insert the winning engine into the winning airframe.  Mandating such development would likely result in increased cost and risk.  Also, this provision would require the designation of a major subprogram on a program that has not yet been designated as a major defense acquisition program.  Mission Force Enhancement Transfer Fund:  The Administration objects to sections 1433 and 4501, which authorize the transfer of $1 billion through the \"Mission Force Enhancement Transfer Fund\" to support efforts not requested in the FY 2012 Budget.    Diversion of Funding:  Over a hundred provisions of the bill (sections 1601-1699M) direct that the relevant Secretary \"shall obligate\" specified funding in particular ways.  The Administration is concerned that these provisions could preclude the use of DoD funds for higher priority military needs.  The Administration requires more time to review these provisions and assess their impact on DoD.  PATRIOT/MEADS Combined Aggregate Program (CAP):  The Administration appreciates the support for DoD's air and missile defense programs; however, it objects to the $149.5 million authorization reduction in the PATRIOT/MEADS Combined Aggregate Program. This reduction could trigger a unilateral withdrawal from the MEADS Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Germany and Italy, which could further lead to a DoD obligation to pay all contract costs\u2014a scenario that would likely exceed the cost of satisfying its commitment under the MOU.  This 4  reduction also could call into question DoD's ability to honor its financial commitments in other binding cooperative MOUs, leading to negative consequences for other current and future international cooperative programs.   Advance Appropriations:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s stated support for the Administration\u2019s new strategy for reforming space acquisition.  However, the Administration is disappointed that no requested advance appropriations are authorized.  Section 132 would only authorize the Secretary of the Air Force to procure two Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites through incremental funding.  Further, H.R. 1540 authorizes only a small portion of the total remaining cost of $4.1 billion requested in regular and advance appropriations to enable full-funding of procurement of AEHF satellites and certain classified programs.  Providing the full procurement costs in advance appropriations before proceeding with the acquisition is central to the Administration\u2019s new acquisition strategy and cost discipline approach.  Ship and Military Construction Incremental Funding:  The Administration objects to the incremental funding in section 121, which would authorize an additional year of incremental funding for the LHA-7 amphibious assault ship.  Large-deck amphibious ships are already funded over two years, and any additional incremental funding period runs counter to sound budgeting principles and fiscal discipline.  Section 4601 would incrementally fund military construction projects, which raises the same concerns and increases the costs of the projects.    Military Activities in Cyberspace:  The Administration agrees that appropriate military operations in cyberspace are a vital component of national security, but objects to Section 962.  The Administration has concerns about this provision and wants to work with Congress to ensure that any such legislation adds clarity and value to our efforts in cyberspace.  Diversion of Pension Funding:  The Administration strongly objects to the restriction in section 3113 of Executive branch authority to manage obligations for contractor pension obligations.  In the FY 2012 Budget, the Administration added substantial funds to ensure that defined-benefit pension plans of Department of Energy contractors are financially viable.  This legislation circumvents efforts by the Administration to implement long-term solutions for pension funding shortfalls.  Abrams/Bradley Upgrades:  The Administration objects to $425 million of unrequested authorization in section 4101, line 007 and 014 for upgrades to M-1 Abrams tanks and M-2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles for unneeded upgrades in a fiscally-constrained environment.    Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV):  Section 214 would restrict the ability to develop improvements to existing AAVs until the completion of an analysis of AAV requirements and the completion of an analysis of alternatives of various options to fill such requirements.  The Marine Corps is committed to a follow-on for the AAV; however, this provision would limit the ability to both improve the existing fleet and inhibit analysis of the best replacement options.  Troops to Teachers Program:  The Administration urges the House\u2019s support for the transfer of the Troops to Teachers Program to DoD in FY 2012, as reflected in the President\u2019s Budget and DoD\u2019s legislative proposal to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and Title 10 of the U.S. Code.  The move to Defense will help ensure that this important program supporting members of the military as teachers is retained and provide better oversight of 5  program outcomes by simplifying and streamlining program management.  The Administration looks forward to keeping the Congress abreast of this transfer, to ensure it runs smoothly and has no adverse impact on program enrollees.  A number of the bill\u2019s provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, including encroachment on the President\u2019s exclusive authorities related to international negotiations.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.                               * * * * * * *     6  ", "The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3309, because it would limit the ability of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to exercise its statutory duty to protect the public interest in its review of transactions affecting the vital communications industry.    H.R. 3309 would, in effect, create a separate Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for the FCC.  For more than 60 years, the APA has provided a uniform framework to guide decision making by all Federal administrative agencies.  That Act, supplemented by a rich body of court precedent, creates the framework for public, reasoned agency actions and provides certainty for regulators and the public.  It is generally recognized that, in recent years, the FCC has improved its practices and procedures to make it more effective.  H.R. 3309 would also limit the FCC\u2019s ability to impose conditions, or to accept commitments from transacting parties, as part of its review of transfers of licenses and other assets.  These restrictions would harm the Federal Government\u2019s ability to promote the most effective competitive outcome in any given transaction involving communications firms.   H.R. 3309 would limit the ability of the FCC and the Justice Department to work together on telecommunications matters to protect consumers, promote competition, and increase innovation to ensure access to more choices, lower rates and prices, and better products.  As evidenced by Executive Orders 13563 and 13579, the Administration is committed to ensuring that the decisions of all Federal agencies are open, transparent, well-founded, and protective of the public interest.  H.R. 3309 does not further those goals.     * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3521.  The legislation creates an expedited procedure that guarantees an up-or-down vote on certain rescissions proposed by the President, helping to eliminate unnecessary spending and discouraging waste.  Since taking office, a priority of the Administration has been identifying and cutting unnecessary spending and redirecting low-priority spending to more productive uses.  This Administration has repeatedly asked the Congress to authorize new tools to eliminate unnecessary spending and discourage waste in the first place.   On May 24, 2010, the President sent to the Congress the Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010 providing for expedited rescission authority.  H.R. 3521 is similar in many ways to the President's proposal; however, it is not identical.  It would allow the President, within 45 days of enactment of a bill or joint resolution, to transmit a special message to the Congress proposing to cancel any discretionary funding provided in the legislation.  Legislation implementing the proposed cancellations would receive expedited consideration in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the bill implementing the rescissions would not be subject to amendment.  To protect the Congress' equities, the President could not repeatedly submit rescissions of the same provisions, and any temporary withholdings of funds would have to be released after the period of time for congressional consideration has passed.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on passage of expedited rescission authority as requested by the President.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2055, making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012, and for other purposes.  The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means and reducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  That is why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, supports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, and meets the commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their circumstances.    While overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of ongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership on the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, a number of problematic policy and language issues have been included in the bill as follows:   Military Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for critical Military Construction projects but is concerned with the use of incremental funding that would not support usable segments for the following projects:  Aviation Complex, Fort Wainwright, Alaska; Mountainview Operations Center, Buckley Air Force Base, Colorado; Ambulatory Care Center, Joint Base Andrews, Maryland; and Guam Strike Fuel Systems Maintenance Hangar, Joint Region Marianas, Guam.  Incremental funding of Military Construction runs counter to sound budgeting principles and fiscal discipline.  Implementation of Force Management Initiatives.  The Administration is concerned with the inclusion of two provisions that limit the ability of the Department of Defense to undertake force management actions, including previously approved Base Realignment and Closure actions.  The authority to execute these force management actions allows the Department to more efficiently allocate scarce resources during a time of conflict.  Constitutional Concerns.  Section 113 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch, without discretion, to notify the Congress 30 days in advance of certain military exercises, which would intrude on the President's discharge of his Constitutional authorities and duties to protect national security.  The Administration recommends revising section 113 to make explicit that 30 days advance notice to the Congress is required where feasible and consistent with the President's constitutional responsibilities to protect national security.  Project Labor Agreements.  The Administration strongly opposes the provision prohibiting the enforcement of Executive Order 13502 (and implementing issuances) on the use of project labor  agreements.  The use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) can provide structure and stability to large construction projects.  PLAs also help ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing workplace safety and health, equal employment opportunity and labor and employment standards. The coordination achieved through PLAs can significantly enhance the economy and efficiency of Federal construction projects.  The Administration strongly opposes inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  Should the Congress continue to include language that is not relevant to a funding debate, the Administration will oppose the bill.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *      2  ", "The Administration supports the intent of S. 1726 to repeal a three percent withholding on certain payments made to private contractors by Federal, State, and local government entities, but strongly objects to the bill\u2019s rescission of appropriated discretionary funds to pay for the repeal.  The repeal of the withholding requirement in S. 1726 would reduce a burden on government contractors, who otherwise comply with their tax obligations, particularly small businesses.  As most recently evidenced in the President\u2019s proposed American Jobs Act, released September 12, 2011, the Administration has supported alleviating this burden, which was originally enacted into law on May 17, 2006.  The Administration also believes it is important to ensure that Federal contractors are compliant with tax laws and support more targeted efforts that prevent persons with outstanding tax debts from receiving Federal contracts.  The effect of the repeal of the withholding requirement would be to avoid a decrease in cashflow to these contractors, which would allow them to retain these funds and use them to create jobs and pay suppliers.  This would complement the Administration\u2019s other efforts to help small businesses.  As well, this provision would reduce implementation costs borne by Federal and other governmental agencies.    However, the rescission of $30 billion of appropriated funds runs counter to the spirit of two recent bipartisan agreements, including the recently-enacted Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  That Act has instituted spending caps that will cut annual Government spending by about $1 trillion over the next ten years and, by the end of the decade, will bring discretionary spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the Eisenhower Administration.  Disregarding the BCA agreement and cutting already-tight discretionary program levels even further, as this bill would do, would be a serious mistake.  The bill\u2019s unspecified rescission of $30 billion in appropriated funds would cause serious disruption in a range of services supported by the Federal Government.  To further address the need to reduce the Federal deficit, the President has offered a detailed blueprint for more than $3 trillion in additional deficit reduction.  The Administration is committed to working with the Congress on a balanced approach to deficit reduction and is willing to work with the Senate to identify acceptable offsets for the budgetary costs associated with the repeal in S. 1726, including but not limited to ones that are in the President\u2019s detailed blueprint.  If S. 1726 is presented to the President with the current offset, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.          * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports efforts to repeal the provision in the Affordable Care Act that established information reporting requirements for tax purposes that place an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses.  The Administration is committed to reducing the gap between taxes legally owed and taxes paid, but believes that the burden created on businesses by the new information reporting requirement on purchases of goods that exceed $600, as included in Section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code as modified by Section 9006 of the Affordable Care Act, is too great.  However, the Administration has serious concerns about the approach the Congress has taken to paying for the repeal.  The Administration strongly opposes the House\u2019s offset to pay for this repeal in H.R. 4, which would undo an improvement enacted with nearly unanimous support in the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act that eliminated an egregious \u201ccliff\u201d in the tax system affecting middle income taxpayers.  Specifically, H.R. 4 would result in tax increases on certain middle-class families that incur unexpected tax liabilities, in many cases totaling thousands of dollars, notwithstanding that they followed the rules.  The Administration also notes that a provision repealing the same information reporting requirements in the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act would pay for the repeal with an unspecified rescission of $44 billion that, in combination with other proposals currently under consideration in Congress, could cause serious disruption in a wide range of services provided by the Federal government.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on the repeal of the information reporting requirements in the course of the legislative process, including finding an acceptable offset for the cost of the repeal.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 9.  The President believes that small business tax relief can promote hiring workers and increasing investment here at home.  H.R. 9, however, is not focused on cutting taxes for small businesses, but instead would provide tax cuts to the most fortunate.  Under the bill\u2019s definition of income, many of the \u201csmall businesses\u201d that would receive the largest tax breaks are law partners, consultants, and other wealthy individuals and corporations with the biggest profits.  The proposal is a giveaway that will cost $46 billion and could, in fact, lead to delays and reductions in investment and hiring.  While H.R. 9 has been described as a way to help small businesses, independent non-partisan analyses confirm that 49 percent of the bill\u2019s benefits would go to taxpayers making more than $1 million per year.  Individuals in higher tax brackets would be able to take the bill\u2019s deduction against higher tax rates, making it more valuable for higher earners and more profitable firms.  For the one percent of individuals with small business income in the top tax bracket and for profitable corporations, the deduction is worth more than double what it is worth to the two-thirds of small business owners in the 15 percent bracket or lower.  Moreover, because \u201csmall business\u201d is broadly defined and the tax relief is conditioned only on the size of payroll, many very large and highly profitable firms will be eligible for the tax break.  The Administration believes that this bill is not an effective way to incentivize small business investment and job creation.  Furthermore, under H.R. 9, small businesses that invested or hired more this year would, in many instances, get a smaller tax cut than those that did not, because the bill would have the deduction taken against the amount of a company\u2019s net income from which wages for new workers or long-term investments in equipment are actually subtracted.  With the deduction only available for one year, it is likely that some firms would reduce or delay new hiring or new investment as a result.  The bill also opens up avenues for potential abuse, allowing a deduction for payments to family members who have been \u201chired\u201d for the year as well as creating an incentive for firms to try to re-characterize current activities to earn the deduction.    Congress should act to help American small businesses hire and grow with targeted tax relief designed to boost jobs, rather than tax cuts for the most fortunate that actually discourage investment.  In both his Budget and his business tax reform framework, the President put forward an ambitious plan to simplify small business tax returns and provide tax relief \u2014 including targeted employer tax relief that conditions its benefit on actual new hiring, directly encouraging job growth.  Those proposals build on the 17 small business tax cuts that the President has already signed into law, ranging from the small business health tax credit to more generous depreciation.  The Administration believes that this legislation fails to accomplish these goals.  If the President is presented with H.R. 9, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee's continued support for our national defense and supports a large number of the provisions in S. 3254, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013, such as its support for both the base budget and for overseas contingency operations; the Administration's initiative to modernize the military retirement system; and authorities that enhance the Department of Defense's (DOD's) ability to operate in unconventional and irregular warfare, counter unconventional threats, or support contingency or stability operations.  However, while there are numerous areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration has serious concerns with provisions that: (1) depart from the President's FY 2013 Budget request; (2) constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions consistent with the new defense strategy; and (3) limit key authorities of the Executive.  If the bill is presented to the President for approval in its current form, the President's senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.  The Administration strongly supports the overall goals of this legislation and looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below, and eventually signing this important legislation.   Detainee Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1031's restrictions on the use of funds to transfer detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to foreign countries.  When he signed past versions of this legislation, the President objected to the restrictions carried forward by section 1031, promised to work towards their repeal, and warned the Congress that the restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay to foreign countries would in certain circumstances interfere with constitutional responsibilities committed to the Executive Branch.  Since these restrictions have been on the books, they have limited the Executive's ability to manage military operations in an ongoing armed conflict, harmed the country's diplomatic relations with allies and counterterrorism partners, and provided no benefit whatsoever to our national security.  The Administration continues to believe that restricting the transfer of detainees to the custody of foreign countries in the context of an ongoing armed conflict interferes with the Executive's ability to make important foreign policy and national security determinations, and would in certain circumstances violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  The Administration also continues to oppose the prohibition on funding to construct, acquire or modify a detention facility in the United States to house any individual detained at Guantanamo, which shortsightedly constrains the options available to military and counterterrorism professionals to address evolving threats.  The restrictions carried forward by section 1031 were misguided when they were enacted and should not be renewed.    TRICARE Fees and Co-Payments:  The Administration strongly encourages the Senate to adopt its requested TRICARE fee initiatives that seek to control the spiraling DOD health care costs while keeping retired beneficiaries' share of these costs well below the levels experienced when the  TRICARE program was implemented in the mid-1990s.  The projected TRICARE savings of $1.8 billion in FY 2013 and $12.9 billion through FY 2017 are essential for DOD to successfully address rising personnel costs.  DOD needs these savings to balance and maintain investments for key defense priorities.    Structure of the Air Force:  The Administration strongly objects to Title XVII, which would place limitations on funding to be used to divest, retire, or transfer units of the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve, in addition to creating a commission to study the appropriate makeup of the Air Force.  These provisions would force DOD to operate, sustain, and maintain aircraft that are in excess to national security requirements, as defined by the new defense strategy, and are not affordable in an austere budget environment. They also would impair the ability of the Secretary to manage the Department and, by retaining large numbers of under-resourced aircraft in the fleet in today's fiscally constrained environment, could contribute to a hollow force.  Reductions in Civilian and Contractor Workforce:  The Administration objects to section 341, which would reduce funding for the civilian and contractor workforce by a rate that is at least equal to the percentage of funding saved from the planned reductions in military personnel end strength.  This would require savings in the civilian and service contractor workforces in excess of $5 billion over planned savings through FY 2017.  The Administration believes the size of the civilian workforce should be determined based on workload and funding, not on arbitrary comparisons to the military.  To comply with this legislation, the Department would need to significantly divest workload and impose workforce caps.  Alternative Fuels:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 313 and 2823, which would limit DOD's ability to procure alternative fuels for military applications.  Section 313 is overly broad and has the potential to restrict investments by making price the sole factor in determining if DOD could use an alternative fuel, without any consideration of military capability, mission, or circumstances contributing to long-term energy security.  Section 2823 would limit DOD's ability to contribute to the development of a domestic capability to produce cost-competitive advanced drop-in biofuels at a commercial scale.  Such a capability, pursued in collaboration with the Departments of Agriculture and Energy, would help insulate the Nation, as well as the military, against potential supply disruptions.   Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS):  The Administration strongly objects to section 236, which would prohibit the use of funds for the MEADS program.  If the Congress does not appropriate FY 2013 funding, there is a high likelihood that this action would be perceived by our partners, Italy and Germany, as breaking our commitment under the Memorandum of Understanding.  This could harm our relationship with our allies on a much broader basis, including future multinational cooperative projects.  It also could prevent the completion of the agreed Proof of Concept activities, which would provide data archiving, analysis of testing, and software development necessary to harvest technology from U.S. and partner investments in MEADS.  Missile Defense:  The Administration appreciates the support for DOD's air and missile defense programs as well as support for the Government of Israel's Iron Dome rocket system.  Replacement Project for Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3111, which would require construction of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) facility to begin in 2013.  The Departments of Defense and Energy agree that, in light of today's fiscal environment, CMRR can be deferred for at least five years, and 2  funds reallocated to support higher priority nuclear weapons goals.  An interim strategy will be implemented to provide adequate support to plutonium pit manufacturing and storage needs until a long-term solution can be implemented.  Further, S. 3254 would require funding for the CMRR in FY 2013 to be taken from other National Nuclear Security Administration priorities, creating undue risks for other parts of the program, including delays to critical infrastructure modernization, underfunding operations of the nuclear complex, and curtailing science, engineering, and key nonproliferation initiatives.  Finally, section 3111 specifies an operational date but caps total funding at the low end of the agency estimate, which may not be achievable.   Limitation on Reimbursement of the Government of Pakistan:  The Administration strongly objects to the certification requirements in section 1216.  These certification requirements \u2013 some of which require the Secretary of Defense to certify Pakistani cooperation on issues outside of his purview \u2013 are proposed at a particularly sensitive time and would severely constrict DOD's ability to respond to emergent war-time coalition support requirements, putting at risk the success of our campaign in Afghanistan.   Cybersecurity:  The Administration objects to sections 925 and 929.  The provisions significantly limit the Administration's flexibility by specifying technical choices that do not allow the National Security Agency to most effectively execute its mission and take advantage of the economic and technological advantages of cloud and next generation technologies.  In particular, section 929 would, in effect, deny the use of an open source project for DOD and establish a dangerous precedent for the use of open source in general.  Unrequested Authorizations:  The Administration objects to the unrequested authorizations for the advance procurement of additional F/A-18E/F Navy fighter aircraft and for unneeded upgrades to the M-1 Abrams tank.  Funding these items in this fiscally-constrained environment would divert scarce resources away from more important defense programs.  Office of Security Cooperation in Iraq (OSC-I):  The Administration appreciates the Committee's full funding for the OSC-I.  However, section 1212 does not include the Administration's requested language that authorizes the OSC-I to conduct critical training and assisting activities for Iraqi Ministry of Defense and Counter-terrorism Service (CTS) personnel.  This authority is needed to continue supporting the Government of Iraq's efforts to address Iraqi Ministry of Defense and CTS capability gaps, which was authorized through the Iraqi Security Forces Fund.  Requirements and Limitations for Suspensions and Debarment Officials:  The Administration objects to section 881, which would impose an identical organizational structure and set of duties for each of the suspension and debarment programs operated by the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The proposed restrictions would unnecessarily force DOD to make disruptive and costly changes to its existing programs \u2013 especially at the Army and DLA \u2013that already are among the most active and effective in the Federal government in protecting taxpayers from fraud, waste, and abuse.  DOD should be allowed to retain the discretion to appropriately tailor its suspension and debarment programs so that they may operate in the most efficient and effective manner possible.  Military Construction Funding for Guam:  The Administration strongly objects to the limitations imposed by section 2208 on the obligation and expenditure of United States and Government of Japan funds to implement the realignment of the U.S. Marine Corps units from Okinawa, to which the United States remains steadfastly committed.  The provision would unnecessarily restrict the 3  ability and flexibility of the President to execute our foreign and defense policies with our ally, Japan.  In April 2012, the United States and Japan announced a new plan to implement the realignment of U.S. forces from Okinawa to Guam.  Prohibiting the use of funds could adversely impact the United States' ability to move forward on the new plan.  Additionally and separate from the section 2208 restrictions, the Administration has serious concerns over the lack of authorization of appropriations for essential upgrades to the fuel pipeline from Apra Harbor to Andersen AB, theater-wide strategic capability.  The reduction of $233 million would impede the implementation of our new defense strategy, which calls for an increased focus on the Asia-Pacific region.    Electro-Optical Imagery:  The Administration objects to section 930, which would require the Administration to sustain the commercial imagery program through FY 2013 at a funding level that is significantly above the President's request.  The plan reflected in the President's Budget results in an approximately 50 percent cost reduction while keeping about 75 percent of the planned capacity growth.  This option represents the best value for the government.  Incremental Funding:  The Administration strongly objects to the use of incremental funding for the Space-Based Infrared System satellites and the VIRGINIA class attack submarine because incremental funding undermines program stability and cost discipline.  Although the Administration supports the underlying programs, the requested full funding and advance appropriations is preferred.  Military Personnel:  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of the requested 1.7 percent military pay raise and the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission.   However, congressional support for the Administration's force management proposals is also critical.  Maintaining readiness, while responsibly reducing our force structure, will be a major challenge in the years ahead.  Enacting the force management proposals, which will provide a key tool in achieving the necessary force drawdown, will give DOD flexibility to create a more agile force, ensure DOD retains the right skills, and preserves the morale of the all-volunteer force.   National Language Service Corps:  The Administration has concerns with section 941 and looks forward to working with the Congress to address those concerns.  Military Access to Reproductive Care and Health:  The Administration supports section 711, which would include the rape and incest exception to the general prohibition on using appropriated funds to perform abortions under section 1093(a) of Title 10.  The inclusion would make this provision consistent with other major abortion funding restrictions in Federal law.  In addition, the Administration supports the restoration of policy to ensure that servicewomen and military dependents \u2013 including servicewomen stationed overseas \u2013 have the ability to obtain abortion services using their own, private funds.   A number of the bill's provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, including separation of powers.  The Administration also looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.  * * * * * * *   4  ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 1940 to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  By requiring the Federal Emergency Management Agency to move to full risk-based premium rates for certain properties, the bill would strengthen the NFIP's financial position and increase its ability to fund future claims.  The bill would also reduce flood risk and increase the resiliency of communities to flooding.  The Administration is pleased that the bill supports transitioning to actuarially sound rates to enable policyholders and communities to adjust to risk-based premiums.  In addition, the Administration supports the bill's measures to strengthen and streamline mitigation programs. As the bill moves through the legislative process, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on additional reforms to strengthen the NFIP and help economically distressed homeowners in a manner that is consistent with the President's Budget.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration recognizes that S. 1931 would at least continue this year's payroll tax cut.  However, the Administration opposes S. 1931 because, by contrast to S. 1917, it provides one-third less tax relief for America's workers, does not help America's small businesses, and is paid for by unbalanced cuts that would break a bipartisan deal achieved in August and would undermine the Nation's ability to invest in areas that are key to America's future, to maintain core government functions, and to defend the United States.      If the Congress does nothing, the typical working family earning $50,000 will see its taxes go up by $1,000.  Under the American Jobs Act and S. 1917, that family's tax cut would be increased from $1,000 to over $1,500.  By contrast, S. 1931 does not expand the current payroll tax cut at all, thus providing one-third less tax relief to 160 million American workers.  In addition, S. 1917 offers relief to America's small businesses by cutting their payroll taxes in half and offering them a complete holiday for adding new payroll.  S. 1931 offers none of this relief.    While S. 1917 proposes to fully pay for the tax cuts in a balanced and fair way by asking those earning over a million dollars a year to pay their fair share, S. 1931 would almost entirely pay for the payroll tax cuts by breaking the bipartisan deal achieved in the Budget Control Act.  It would add new cuts on top of the $1 trillion in reductions to defense and non-defense spending under the Budget Control Act and the additional $1.2 trillion in cuts that could automatically go into place because of the failure of the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction.  The additional spending cuts under S. 1931 would mean further reductions in areas like education and energy, reducing core government functions ranging from services for this Nation's veterans to border security, and further cutting back spending on the Nation's defense.   The President is committed to providing tax relief to America's workers and small businesses next year and fully paying for this relief in a way that is fair.  The Administration strongly supports S. 1917 and opposes S. 1931.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3630.  With only days left before taxes go up for 160 million hardworking Americans, H.R. 3630 plays politics at the expense of middle-class families.  H.R. 3630 breaks the bipartisan agreement on spending cuts that was reached just a few months ago and would inevitably lead to pressure to cut investments in areas like education and clean energy.  Furthermore, H.R. 3630 seeks to put the burden of paying for the bill on working families, while giving a free pass to the wealthiest and to big corporations by protecting their loopholes and subsidies.  Instead of working together to find a balanced approach that will actually pass both Houses of the Congress, H.R. 3630 instead represents a choice to refight old political battles over health care and introduce ideological issues into what should be a simple debate about cutting taxes for the middle class.   This debate should not be about scoring political points.  This debate should be about cutting taxes for the middle class.   If the President were presented with H.R. 3630, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2930.  In the President\u2019s September 8th Address to a Joint Session of Congress on jobs and the economy, he called for cutting away the red tape that prevents many rapidly growing startup companies from raising needed capital, including through a \u201ccrowdfunding\u201d exemption from the requirement to register public securities offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This proposal, which would enable greater flexibility in soliciting relatively small equity investments, grew out of the President\u2019s Startup America initiative and has been endorsed by the President\u2019s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.  H.R. 2930 is broadly consistent with the President\u2019s proposal.  This bill will make it easier for entrepreneurs to raise capital and create jobs.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to craft legislation that facilitates capital formation and job growth and provides appropriate investor protections.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration will continue to work with the Congress to responsibly implement the Affordable Care Act.  However, the Administration will strongly oppose legislation that attempts to erode the important provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.

The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means and reducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  That is why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, supports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, meets the commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their circumstances, and provides for our national security.   While overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of ongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership on the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, the Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Overseas Construction Funding.  The Administration is concerned about the reduction in funding for military construction projects in Bahrain as well as those associated with the relocation of United States Marines to Guam.  Deferring or eliminating these projects could signal that the U.S. does not stand by its allies or its agreements such as the realignment of forces from Okinawa to Guam.  Military Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for critical military construction projects but is concerned with the use of incremental funding that would not support usable segments for the following projects:  Aviation Complex, Fort Wainwright, Alaska; Mountainview Operations Center, Buckley Air Force Base, Colorado; Ambulatory Care Center, Joint Base Andrews, Maryland; Ambulatory Care Center, Joint Base San Antonio, Texas; and Guam Strike Fuel Systems Maintenance Hangar, Joint Region Marianas, Guam.  Incremental funding of military construction projects runs counter to sound budgeting principles and fiscal discipline.  Constitutional Concerns.  Section 113 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch, without discretion, to notify the Congress 30 days in advance of certain military exercises, which would intrude on the President's discharge of his constitutional authorities and duties to protect national security.  The Administration recommends revising section 113 to make explicit that 30 days advance notice to the Congress is required where feasible and consistent with the President's constitutional responsibilities to protect national security.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012  appropriations process moves forward.   * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration appreciates the support of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) for the resources, capabilities, and authorities for the Intelligence Community and supports many of the provisions contained in H.R. 1892.  However, the Administration has serious concerns with several provisions, including those described below, that would invite conflict between the branches of government.   The Administration looks forward to reviewing the updated classified annex accompanying H.R. 1892.  In a letter from the Director of National Intelligence dated August 30, 2011, the Administration identified specific provisions in the Senate classified annex that also raised serious concerns.  If H.R. 1892 is presented to the President and includes the issues of concern described below and includes, but does not adequately address, the specific provisions of the Senate classified annex, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend a veto.    Submission of Information on Detainees Held at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 307 and 309, which would state that the DNI must provide the Intelligence Committees with each Department of State cable, memorandum, or report containing certain information relating to Guantanamo Bay detainees, as well as government-to-government assurances related to the transfer of those detainees.  The Administration believes that such disclosure will have a significant adverse impact on the willingness of foreign partners, who often expressly request this information not be disseminated, to communicate frankly on these matters.  The cables and other documents at issue \u2013 originated and controlled by the Department of State, not the ODNI \u2013 contain deliberative commentary and sensitive diplomatic discussions and negotiations, including commitments made by foreign governments relating to the handling of transferred detainees.  The Department of State has accordingly declined to produce these documents to Congress or to U.S. federal courts because of the need to protect diplomatic communications in conducting effective foreign relations.  The Administration is concerned that these provisions may conflict with the Executive Branch's constitutional authority to control the disclosure of information when necessary to preserve the Executive's ability to perform its constitutional responsibilities.   Confirmation of Appointment of the Director of the National Security Agency:  The Administration strongly objects to section 421, which would add a requirement that the person nominated for the position of Director of the National Security Agency be confirmed by the Senate.  The Administration believes that if this provision were to become law, a critical national security position would likely remain unfilled for a significant period of time, adversely impacting the management and function of the National Security Agency.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.  * * * * * * *      2  ", " ", "The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of H.R. 1, making appropriations for the Department of Defense and the other departments and agencies of the Government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, and for other purposes.  As stated previously, the Administration is committed to cutting spending and reducing the deficit so that current Government spending does not add to the debt, and has put forward a plan to do just that. However, the Administration does not support deep cuts that will undermine our ability to out-educate, out-build, and out-innovate the rest of the world.  The unbalanced bill would undermine the Nation\u2019s economic recovery and its ability to succeed in a complex global environment.  If the President is presented with a bill that undermines critical priorities or national security through funding levels or restrictions, contains earmarks, or curtails the drivers of long-term economic growth and job creation while continuing to burden future generations with deficits, the President will veto the bill.   The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the Inouye substitute amendment 149, which responds to the Administration\u2019s call to meet the House half-way in achieving the $102 billion in reductions that advocates for H.R. 1 have proposed.  The amendment is a fair compromise and, unlike H.R. 1, does not undermine the Nation\u2019s economic recovery and long-term growth.  The Administration will continue to work with the Congress to reduce spending and do so in a manner that reflects sound economic policy, protects key investments, and allows critical Government functions to operate without interruption for the remainder of the fiscal year underway.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1633.  As drafted, this bill would create serious problems for implementing Clean Air Act (CAA) public health protections that have been in place for years while adding uncertainty for businesses and States.  The bill therefore, goes far beyond its stated intent of prohibiting the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from tightening national standards for coarse particles, which the Administration has repeatedly explained that it has no intention of doing.   This ambiguously written bill would create high levels of regulatory uncertainty regarding emission control requirements that have been in place for years.  Specifically, the bill's exclusion from the entire CAA of a new class of air pollutants called \"nuisance dust\" (an imprecise and scientifically-undefined term) could be used to roll back existing public health protection limiting pollution from mining operations, industrial activities, and possibly other sources.  The bill also raises serious issues about whether EPA could continue to implement the existing health-based fine and coarse particle programs, which play a vital, ongoing role in preventing adverse health effects of air pollution including premature deaths, childhood asthma attacks and other respiratory problems.   Further, this bill is unnecessary, as it purports to address a problem that does not exist.  Responding to false claims that EPA intended to tighten regulation of coarse particles EPA has repeatedly explained that it plans to retain the existing coarse particulate standard, which originally went into effect in 1987 and remains adequately protective of public health.  This Administration remains committed to commonsense approaches to improving air quality across the country and preserving the competitiveness of every economic sector.  Because H.R. 1633 is not only unnecessary, but also could have significant adverse public health consequences, the Administration strongly opposes the bill.   If H.R. 1633 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 3412 to prevent income taxes from going up at the start of next year on millions of middle-class Americans.    If the Congress does not act, a typical middle-class family of four will see its taxes rise next year by $2,200 \u2013 a sizable financial hit for middle-class families that could hardly come at a worse time.  By extending middle-class income tax relief for an additional year, S. 3412 will provide certainty to the 98 percent of Americans with incomes of less than $250,000 (for married couples) that their income taxes will not go up next year \u2013 strengthening the recovery by helping spur economic growth and job creation.    Extending middle-class tax cuts means continuing the temporary income tax relief currently scheduled to expire at the end of the year for the first $250,000 of income for married couples.  If this temporary tax relief is not extended, over 35 million families will receive a smaller Child Tax Credit, while millions of low- and moderate-income working families will lose access to the credit altogether; 11 million middle-class families will no longer get help paying for college from the American Opportunity Tax Credit; married couples will see a tax increase of up to $890 from the expiration of the 10 percent tax bracket; and nearly 38 million middle-class couples will lose the temporary relief they are receiving from marriage penalties.  Under the legislation, 97 percent of small businesses owners would continue to receive tax cuts on their business income, and small businesses that are investing in the economy will be able to claim immediate tax deductions for $250,000, rather than just $25,000, of new investments.  While preventing any income tax increases on 114 million American families earning less than $250,000, acceptable middle-class tax relief would not extend the tax cuts on income above that amount.  But households at all income levels would benefit from middle-class tax relief.  S. 3412 is similar to the President's proposal to extend the middle-class tax relief.  Under the President\u2019s proposal, even households with incomes over $1 million will continue to receive tax cuts averaging more than $10,000 from lower tax rates on their first $250,000 of income.  In contrast, if all of the tax cuts were extended, including those that go only to the top 2 percent of households, tax cuts for households with incomes over $1 million would average about $160,000.  Rather than continuing the unaffordable and unneeded tax cuts for the highest-income 2 percent of Americans, middle-class tax relief, such as S. 3412, asks the best off to contribute to deficit reduction by paying income taxes at the same rates as during the 1990s, when the economy  created nearly 23 million new jobs and the largest budget surplus in American history.  Relative to S. 3412, continuing all of the income tax cuts for the top 2 percent of households for just one more year would add about $50 billion to the deficit.  Making the high-income tax cuts permanent would add about $850 billion to deficits over the next 10 years, or nearly $1 trillion if the cost of proposed estate tax cuts is included as well.  Allowing these tax cuts to expire is an essential component of the President's plan for balanced deficit reduction.  The Administration believes that the Nation's prosperity has always come from an economy that is built on a strong and growing middle class.

While overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of ongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership on the Nation\u2019s long-term fiscal picture, the bill provides insufficient funding for a number of programs in a way that undermines core government functions and investments key to economic growth and job creation.  Programs adversely affected by the bill include:   Food and Nutrition Service (FNS).  The Administration strongly objects to the level of funding provided for nutrition programs that are critical to the health of nutritionally at-risk women, infants, children, and elderly adults.  The proposed funding levels would lead to hundreds of thousands of participants being cut from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and reduce Federal support for food banks.  These cuts would undermine efforts to prevent hunger and support sound nutrition for some of the most vulnerable members of our society.  Food Safety.  The Administration is concerned with the funding provided in the bill for the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA\u2019s) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) which will significantly hamper USDA\u2019s ability to inspect food processing plants and prevent food borne illnesses and disease such as E. coli and Salmonella from contaminating America\u2019s food supply.  The Committee\u2019s recommendation may require the agency to furlough employees including frontline inspectors which make up over 80 percent of FSIS staff.   By reducing FSIS inspections, food processing plants may be forced to reduce line speeds, which could lead to decreasing product output and profits, as well as plant closures.     Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI).  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not support HFFI, which is a key initiative to combat childhood obesity.  HFFI will expand USDA\u2019s activities to bring healthy foods to low-income Americans and increase the availability of affordable, healthy foods in underserved urban and rural communities by bringing grocery  stores and other fresh food retailers to \u201cfood desert\u201d communities where there is little or no access to healthy food.   Research.  The bill provides insufficient funds for USDA research programs, which are needed to help solve food production, safety, quality, energy and environmental problems.  By reducing funding for the Agricultural Research Service to its lowest level since 2004 as well as inadequately funding the Nation\u2019s competitive grant program, the bill will hinder the Department\u2019s ability to develop solutions to address current as well as impending critical national and international challenges.   Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Administration is concerned that the funding level in the bill and resulting staff reductions will severely limit the FDA\u2019s ability to protect the public\u2019s health, assure the American consumer that food and medical products are safe, and improve Americans\u2019 access to safe and less costly generic drugs and biologics.   Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The Administration strongly objects to the funding level for CFTC, as it would cause a cut in staffing levels and seriously undermine CFTC\u2019s ability to protect investors and consumers by effectively policing the futures and swaps marketplace through its current market oversight and enforcement functions.  Moreover, the funding level would significantly curtail the timely, effective implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, including new CFTC responsibilities to regulate the $300 trillion swaps derivatives market.  International Food Aid.  The Administration opposes the level of funding provided for the Food for Peace Title II international food aid program as it would severely limit the United States\u2019 ability to provide food assistance in response to emergencies and disasters around the world.  Given a statutory floor on non-emergency development food aid, a reduction would be borne entirely by the emergency component of the program, and would prevent distribution of emergency food aid to over 11 million beneficiaries.   In addition, the bill includes the following problematic policy and language issues:   Restrictions on Finalizing USDA Regulations.  The Administration opposes the inclusion of section 721 of the bill, which effectively prevents USDA\u2019s Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration from finalizing a rule on conduct that would violate the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.  The final rule has not yet been published and any concerns about the rule are better addressed through the standard rulemaking process than through an appropriations rider.   Restrictions on FDA Regulations and Guidance.  The Administration strongly opposes section 740 of the bill, which would undermine or nullify FDA statutory standards that have been in place for decades and that are essential to protect the health of Americans.  The provision would unduly limit the factors that FDA considers in determining the best ways to protect the public from unsafe foods; protect the safety of the blood supply from HIV, West Nile Virus, and other infections; ensure the safety of infant formula; protect patients from drugs and medical devices that have not been shown to be safe and effective; assure that food labeling and health claims on foods are accurate; and reduce youth use of tobacco products and otherwise reduce illness and death caused by tobacco use.   2  WTO Trade Dispute.  The Administration is concerned by a provision in section 743 that would eliminate payments that are being made as part of the mutually agreed settlement of a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute regarding U.S. domestic cotton supports and the export credit guarantee program.  The framework serves as a basis to avoid trade-related countermeasures by Brazil that are authorized by the WTO until the enactment of successor legislation to the current Farm Bill.  Under the agreement, the United States is committed to fund technical assistance and capacity-building support for Brazil\u2019s cotton sector.  The bill\u2019s provision preempts the resolution process and would open the door to retaliation negatively affecting U.S. exports and interests.   The Administration strongly opposes inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 appropriations process moves forward to ensure the Administration can support enactment of the legislation.  * * * * * * *  3  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.R. 2112, making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies;  programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012, and for other purposes; the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2012; and the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2012.  The Administration is committed to living within its means so that we can make investments to spur economic growth and job creation for years to come.  This bill invests in areas important to our Nation's ability to grow and compete in the global economy while broadly sharing sacrifices to reduce the deficit.  Division 1 \u2013 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  The Administration urges the Senate to ensure that rural America has the resources necessary to help our Nation thrive and compete in the future.  A strong agricultural sector requires investment in innovation and clean energy technologies, access to health care and healthy food, and support for job creating measures like increased agricultural exports.    U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  Food and Nutrition Service.  The Administration strongly supports funding for nutrition programs that are critical to the health of nutritionally at-risk women, infants, children, and elderly adults.  The funding provided for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children could constrain some of the important services and activities currently supported by the program, and might require the Administration to use contingency funds to cover regular program costs.  The Administration encourages the Senate to fund the contingency fund for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at the President's FY 2011 Budget level of $5 billion.  The SNAP contingency fund typically holds in reserve about three to four weeks' worth of benefits to cover unforeseen events, such as disasters and fluctuations in food prices.  Food Safety and Inspection Service.  The Administration appreciates the funding provided for USDA's meat and poultry inspection activities, which will maintain current agency operations and continue to ensure the safety of the Nation's meat and poultry supply.  Combatting Food Deserts.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide funding for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI), which is a key component of the Administration's  efforts to combat childhood obesity.  HFFI will expand USDA's activities to bring healthy foods to low-income Americans and increase the availability of affordable, healthy foods in underserved urban and rural communities by bringing grocery stores and other fresh food retailers to \"food desert\" communities where there is little or no access to healthy food.  International Food Assistance.  The Administration supports the Senate bill's level of over $1.56 billion for Food for Peace Title II international food aid.  This level allows the Administration to respond to major emergencies, including the current famine in the Horn of Africa, which highlights the critical importance of these funds.  Program Terminations and Reductions. The Administration urges the Senate to accept additional savings from terminations and reductions proposed in the President's Budget for USDA, including termination of Rural Housing Services small loan and grant programs and reductions in single family housing direct loans and housing repair grants. Adopting these terminations and reductions will free up scarce resources for higher-priority needs and more effective programs such as food safety.

The Administration strongly supports robust funding for FDA to continue implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act, which includes establishing science-based prevention standards, conducting increased and more effective inspections, improving oversight of imports, and investing in the development of medical products, including countermeasures for biodefense threats.  The Administration requested a $287 million increase in budget authority for FDA above FY 2011 enacted levels, and the Senate bill provides a $49 million increase.  The Administration strongly urges the Senate to provide no less than the $2.5 billion currently in the Senate bill.  In FY 2012, FDA must have sufficient resources to achieve its essential mission of protecting the public's health, assuring that food and medical products are safe, and improving Americans' access to safe and less costly generic drugs and biologics.  Division 2 \u2013 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies  The Administration urges the Senate to ensure that the Congress is adequately investing in innovation and job creation, community safety, and cutting-edge science and technology, which are critical to our economic growth, security, and global competitiveness.  Research and education grants, space technology, and satellite coverage are all central to this achieving these goals.    Department of Commerce (DOC)  Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS).  The Administration appreciates the significant increase provided by the Senate, but notes that the bill falls short of the funding needed to maintain the current estimated launch date in FY 2017.  The Administration encourages the Senate to provide funding for JPSS at no less than the current Senate level; without sufficient funding for JPSS the Nation faces a significant risk of a gap in satellite coverage that will result in degraded weather forecasts and, in turn, potential negative impacts on public safety and weather-sensitive sectors such as agriculture and transportation.  Census Bureau.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide no less than $690 million for Periodic Censuses and Programs.  This funding is needed to initiate the 2012 Economic Census, 2  which is a critical program that provides benchmarks for Gross Domestic Product estimates.  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The Administration urges the Senate to provide strong funding for NIST's intramural research programs, to support current innovation activities and cybersecurity initiatives.  NIST programs provide vital contributions to advancing the Nation's innovation and competitiveness, funding crucial research in areas such as advanced manufacturing and nanotechnology.  The Administration also urges the Senate to support the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and AMTech programs to help revitalize America's manufacturing sector.  International Trade Administration (ITA).  The Administration urges the Senate to provide $451 million to adequately fund ITA.  The export promotion and trade enforcement activities supported by ITA's components of the National Export Initiative will help American businesses generate sales abroad and create jobs.  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Service.  The Administration appreciates the Senate bill's support for a Climate Service line office, and urges the Senate to approve this realignment of existing NOAA programs.  A Climate Service will improve the performance of roughly $340 million in related programs that are currently spread across three NOAA line offices.  The Administration also supports the Senate bill's overall funding level for NOAA's research efforts.  Department of Justice (DOJ)  State and Local Assistance.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide the FY 2011 enacted level of $245 million to the Community Oriented Policing Services' Hiring Grants Program to hire and retain State and local police officers.  The funding level in the Senate bill would only support about 1,400 jobs whereas funding at the FY 2011 enacted level would support 1,900 jobs.  The Administration also urges the Senate to restore funding for Second Chance Act programs to aid the successful reentry of returning prisoners.  In addition, the Administration supports adequate funding for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants program (including Criminal Justice Innovation) to support law enforcement.  Federal Prison System.  The Administration supports the level of funding in the Senate bill for the Federal Prison System, which will provide sufficient resources to keep pace with the continued growth in the inmate population and inflationary increases including inmate medical and food costs.  Additionally, the Bureau of Prisons would be able to staff and begin operating several prisons that have been or will be fully constructed.  General Legal Activities and Administrative Review and Appeals (GLA and ARA).  The Administration urges the Senate to provide $899 million for GLA, $53 million above the Committee bill, and $318 million for ARA, $24 million above the Committee bill, to ensure full-year funding for immigration judges and the new attorneys recently added for high-priority work, such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and civil rights enforcement.  Much of the Executive Office for Immigration Review's (EOIR) workload is tied directly to Department of Homeland Security enforcement efforts, with EOIR caseload reaching over 400,000 in FY 2011 and continuing to grow.  GLA's civil rights work includes important initiatives such as prosecuting hate crimes and enforcing the voting rights of members of the Armed Services.  Program Terminations and Reductions.  The Administration urges the Senate to adopt the 3  President's proposed terminations and reductions, including the $137 million reduction to the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, which would free up scarce resources that could be redirected toward higher priority needs and programs that have a greater potential for results.  Asset Forfeiture Fund.  The Administration encourages the Senate to rescind a total of $675 million from the Asset Forfeiture Fund, which is $55 million more than the rescission in the Committee bill.  Recent deposits into the Fund resulting from fraud and other investigations justify the higher rescission amount.  Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)  The Administration urges the Senate to maintain the current bill level of $6 million.  This funding will enable OSTP to continue leading interagency efforts to develop and implement sound science and technology policies.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  Space Launch System and Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle.  The Administration appreciates the Senate bill's support for the Space Launch System and Multi-purpose Crew Vehicle programs.  These systems are key elements of America's future human space exploration efforts.  Commercial Crew Program.  The Administration encourages the Senate to provide sufficient funding for the Commercial Crew Program to avoid delaying the development of U.S. crew transport capabilities and lengthening the period during which the United States will need to pay Russia to transport crew to the International Space Station.  James Webb Space Telescope.  The Administration appreciates the Senate's support for this project, which will advance our understanding of the universe and was given high priority by the astronomy and astrophysics community.   Space Technology.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide NASA the level of funding included in the Senate Committee bill.  NASA's ability to create an effective space technology development pipeline is key to making America's future missions to deep space affordable and achievable and to strengthening the Nation's space industry and capabilities.    National Science Foundation (NSF)  The Administration supports strong funding for NSF, and appreciates the flexibility provided in the bill to transfer funding between accounts.  NSF's grants are critical to America's scientific leadership and its competitiveness.    United States Trade Representatives (USTR)  The Administration urges the Senate to provide $51.3 million for USTR.  The funding in the Senate bill would undermine USTR's ability to pursue trade enforcement cases and participate in trade negotiations like the Trans Pacific Partnership.  USTR is critical to our goal of increasing American exports.  Legal Services Corporation (LSC)   4  The Administration strongly supports the Senate bill's level of $396 million and the language in the bill to lift restrictions on the use of non-LSC funds by LSC grantees.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)  The Administration supports maintaining funding for the EEOC to help the agency fulfill its critical mission of enforcing antidiscrimination laws.  Funding reductions could lead to growth in EEOC's private sector charge backlog, leaving those who have suffered discrimination waiting longer to seek legal relief.  Bill-Wide Provision  Fighting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.  While section 527 of the bill aims to serve the important goal of combatting waste, fraud, and abuse, as written the provision would deny agencies the ability to make informed decisions about contracts, grants, and other Federal assistance.  It thus risks causing unintended consequences that could translate into unwarranted penalties on businesses and unjustified costs on taxpayers.    Constitutional Concerns  Several provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  Sections 113(a), 510, 522, and 528 of the bill would effectively direct the manner or substance of the Executive's international negotiations, where the President's constitutional authority is exclusive.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Senate to address these concerns.  In addition, the Administration objects to and has constitutional concerns about section 532 of the bill.  This provision's restrictions on the transfer of detainees to the United States and to the custody or effective control of foreign countries or entities in the context of an ongoing armed conflict may interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and to make important foreign policy and national security determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers should occur.  Such restrictions or interferences would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  Division 3 \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  The Administration urges the Senate to provide the resources necessary to continue to invest in infrastructure, housing and community development programs that are critical to the Nation's economic recovery and long-term competitiveness.    Department of Transportation  Surface Transportation Obligation Limitations.  The Administration supports the Senate's approach of funding highway, highway safety, and mass transit obligation limitations at baseline levels.  The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to pass:  1) the American Jobs Act, which includes $50 billion in transportation investments to improve the Nation's transportation system and create and maintain jobs; 2) a long-term reauthorization bill that continues those critical investments and ensures Highway Trust Fund solvency; and 3) Infrastructure Bank legislation, which would leverage private and public capital to invest in a broad range of infrastructure projects of national and regional significance.  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The Administration supports funding for FAA's 5  operations and urges the Senate to fully fund FAA's collectively-bargained personnel expenses.  The Administration also urges the Senate to provide $950 million for NextGen, FAA's air traffic modernization effort, so FAA can continue to make progress in transforming the radar based air traffic control system to a more efficient satellite based system.  Amtrak.  The Administration strongly supports the Senate bill's level for Amtrak, which carried more passengers in fiscal year 2011 than any year since its creation in 1971.  Among those lines seeing ridership increases are the State-supported routes; fifteen States have partnered with Amtrak to provide improved passenger rail service, resulting in 150 daily trains that carry about one-third of Amtrak's total ridership.  The Senate proposed levels will ensure these improvements are sustained.  High Speed Rail.  The Administration believes that the development of high speed rail corridors in the Nation's most densely populated regions, along with improved existing intercity rail service, is critical to having a balanced, well-functioning national transportation network.  The Administration appreciates that the bill includes $100 million for high speed rail projects, and supports funding to continue the progress made over the past three years to improve the Nation's intercity passenger rail system.  TIGER Grants.  The Administration supports the Senate bill's level of $550 million for TIGER grants, which are awarded through a competitive selection process to innovative, multi-modal transportation projects, often with substantial State and local co-investment.  Environmental Waivers.  The Administration strongly opposes section 128 of the bill that includes exemptions from seven specific statutes, an Executive Order, and any law intended to ensure adequate protection of wetlands.  The regulations and requirements cited have been in place for decades and there are processes in place that allow for expedited action in the event of natural disasters.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Rental Assistance Programs.  The Administration appreciates the Senate bill's support for HUD's two largest rental assistance programs \u2013 Housing Choice Vouchers and Project-Based Rental Assistance.  The funding provided for these programs is sufficient to maintain rental assistance to current low-income residents.  The Administration also appreciates the Senate's support for the Rental Assistance Demonstration.  Public Housing Capital Fund.  The Administration urges the Senate to fund the Public Housing Capital Fund at no less than the FY 2011 enacted level of $2 billion.  Given a capital needs backlog that exceeds $20 billion, maintaining at least level funding is essential for the preservation of critical affordable rental units.  Homeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide additional funds for Homeless Assistance Grants.  Funding provided by the bill would meet the renewal needs for Continuum of Care programs and Emergency Solution Grants, but would not enable progress on implementing the HEARTH Act and the Federal Strategic Plan to End Homelessness.  Without additional funding, HUD will be unable to provide rapid housing interventions to nearly 8,400 disabled homeless persons and families, as well as approximately 16,500 households.  Place-Based Initiatives.  The Administration strongly supports the Senate bill's funding levels for 6  Choice Neighborhoods and Sustainable Communities.  These initiatives are critical components of the Administration place-based efforts to fight concentrated poverty and fund strategic plans to integrate housing and transportation investments to expand economic opportunities.  While the Administration appreciates the Senate's support for funding the Strong Cities, Strong Communities (SC2) initiative within HUD's Transformation Initiative (TI) account, the Administration urges the Senate to provide HUD with full discretion to allocate funds to SC2 and other TI projects as needed to improve State and local governments' development capacities and meet Departmental priorities.  Housing Counseling.  The Administration appreciates the Senate bill's support of Housing Counseling at $60 million.  The lack of funding for this program in FY 2011 and the state of the housing market makes it essential to restore base funding for this program.  This funding will support personal counseling and education to families, largely of moderate or low income, and assist them with responses to foreclosure or help them secure affordable housing.  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and HOME.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide additional funds for the CDBG and the HOME Investment Partnership Program.  The Senate bill's substantial reductions to these two programs would significantly delay\u2014and in some cases stop\u2014infrastructure investments, including affordable housing development, and would have detrimental effects on State and local governments across the country.  Other Independent Agencies  Interagency Council on Homelessness.  The Administration supports the level of Senate bill's funding for the Interagency Council on the Homelessness and urges the Senate to provide permanent authorization for the agency.  The Interagency Council has been a crucial part of this Administration's goal of ending homelessness in America as laid out in the Federal Strategic Plan.   * * * * * * *   7  ", "The Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas production as part of a broad energy strategy that will protect consumers and reduce our dependence on oil.  Safety and environmental reforms that the Administration implemented in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill are critical to achieving those objectives.  These reforms strengthen requirements for issues ranging from well design to workplace safety to corporate accountability, and they require operators to show that they can contain a subsea oil spill like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  S. 953 generally would undercut these critical reforms; therefore, the Administration opposes S. 953.   S. 953 would undermine the Administration's work to ensure that environmental analysis required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is conducted in a rigorous manner.  S. 953 would hastily open areas of the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and the Atlantic to leasing, and require the Department of the Interior (DOI) to hold multiple lease sales in the Gulf and Alaska using outdated NEPA analysis that was conducted before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The Administration has strengthened NEPA analysis in light of lessons learned from the spill and is committed to responsible development in the Gulf and the Arctic.  DOI intends to hold the Gulf lease sales referenced in the bill by mid-2012.  With respect to Alaska, DOI has committed to holding annual lease sales in the National Petroleum Reserve while respecting sensitive areas, encouraging development of existing leases by establishing a high-level interagency working group to coordinate the permitting process (including necessary environmental and safety reviews), and extending certain offshore leases.    S. 953 would constrain the ability of DOI to ensure that permits meet safety standards by requiring permitting decisions to be made within 30 days of receiving an application, thereby curtailing the review period.  Two 15-day extensions would be possible, though DOI would be required to submit burdensome justifications.  The bill would grant permits automatically at the end of this 60-day window, regardless of whether the applicant satisfied safety standards.  These concerns also arise over environmental safeguards and reviews.  The Administration believes these statutory time constraints are unwarranted.  Fifty-three new shallow water permits have been issued since the Administration's stronger safety standards were put in place, and deepwater permit applications also are being processed in a timely manner.  Since the end of February, when industry first demonstrated to safety regulators the capability to contain a subsea spill, fourteen deepwater wells have been permitted.  S. 953 also would require the Secretary of the Interior to grant an automatic one-year suspension of leases (effectively extending the term of the leases) in the Gulf.  The Administration fully supports suspensions for Gulf leaseholders directly impacted by the drilling moratorium.  Ten such suspensions have already been granted using administrative procedures to leaseholders who  demonstrated that they were affected by the moratoria.  * * * * * * *     2  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, and tailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 10, the Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, which would impose an unprecedented requirement that a joint resolution of approval be enacted by the Congress before any major rule of Executive Branch agencies could have force or effect.  This radical departure from the longstanding separation of powers between the Executive and Legislative branches would delay and, in many cases, thwart implementation of statutory mandates and execution of duly enacted laws, increase business uncertainty, undermine much-needed protections of the American public, and create unnecessary confusion.  There is no justification for such an unprecedented requirement.  When a Federal agency promulgates a major rule, it must already adhere to the particular requirements of the statute that it is implementing and to the constraints imposed by other Federal statutes and the Constitution.  Indeed, in many cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the particular rule.  The agency must also comply with the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551, et seq.).  When it issues a major rule, the agency must perform analyses of benefits and costs that typically are required by one or more statutes (such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act) as well as by Executive Order 12866.  In addition, this Administration has already taken numerous steps to reduce regulatory costs and to ensure that all major regulations are designed to maximize net benefits to society.  Most recently, Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased public participation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a regulatory retrospective review.  Finally, agency rules are subject to Federal courts.  Moreover, for the past 15 years, the Congress itself has had the opportunity, under the Congressional Review Act of 1996 (CRA), to review on an individual basis the rules \u2013 both major and non-major \u2013 that Federal agencies have issued.   By replacing this well established framework with a blanket requirement of Congressional approval, H.R. 10 would throw all major regulations into a months-long limbo, fostering uncertainty and impeding business investment that is vital to economic growth.  Maintaining an appropriate allocation of responsibility between the two branches is essential to ensuring that the Nation's regulatory system effectively protects public health, welfare, safety, and our  environment, while also promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.    If the President were presented with H.R. 10, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly supports the enactment of S.1038, which reauthorizes through June 1, 2015, three critical authorities that our Nation's intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to protect our national security.  These authorities, which expire after May 26, 2011 absent extension, are:  (1) section 206 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority for roving surveillance of targets who take steps that may thwart Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) surveillance; (2) section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority to compel production of business records and other tangible things with the approval of the FISA court; and (3) section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which provides authority under FISA to target non-U.S. persons who engage in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor, but are not necessarily associated with an identified terrorist group (the so-called \"lone wolf\" provision).  It is essential to avoid any hiatus in these critical authorities.    * * * * * * *       ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the amendment in the nature of the substitute to H.R. 1 providing supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2013 to respond to and recover from the severe damage caused by Hurricane Sandy.  The Senate amendment will provide the necessary resources to continue ongoing response and recovery efforts, while helping impacted communities effectively mitigate future risk of disaster to prevent losses of this magnitude from recurring.   The amendment ensures urgent and essential needs are being met, while recognizing the need to prevent losses of this magnitude from future disasters.  Further, it ensures that funds are invested wisely to improve communities' long-term resilience and protect against waste, fraud, and abuse. Given the emergency and one-time nature of this supplemental appropriation, and in keeping with the response to Hurricane Katrina, Deepwater Horizon, and other disasters, the Administration supports the decision to not offset these funds.  The Administration remains committed to balanced deficit reduction, and it believes both parties can come together to achieve that, while ensuring communities affected by Hurricane Sandy have the support they need to recover.  Providing Federal funding for response, recovery, and mitigation following Hurricane Sandy will maintain the Nation's tradition of pulling together to help one another in times of greatest need. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to refine the legislation and urges the Congress to pass a bill as soon as possible to give affected States and communities the support they need to recover and rebuild.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 3240, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, and looks forward to working with the Congress to address the important concerns described below prior to final passage. The Administration greatly appreciates the Senate's bipartisan efforts to enact a farm bill.  With authorization for farm- and food-related programs set to expire this year, it is critical that the Congress pass legislation that provides certainty for rural America and includes needed reforms and savings.  The new farm bill should promote rural development, preserve a farm safety net, maintain strong nutrition programs, enhance conservation, honor our World Trade Organization commitments, and advance agricultural research.  In light of the Nation's long-term fiscal challenge, the legislation should also contribute significantly to deficit reduction.    The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, S. 3240, makes meaningful progress toward the Administration's goals.  Notable reforms include eliminating the direct payment system; tightening payment and eligibility requirements; strengthening access to healthy, affordable food; protecting emergency food aid programs and authorities; and increasing flexibility in the delivery of international food aid.  The Administration supports the Senate's efforts to consolidate and streamline conservation assistance, which will reduce administrative burdens on farmers and ranchers and improve environmental outcomes.  The bill's funding for bioenergy programs will enhance our energy security while supporting innovation and growth in rural economies.    Consistent with the President's Budget, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve crop insurance and commodity program savings that are not contained in S. 3240, while at the same time strengthening the farm safety net in times of need and supporting the next generation of farmers.  The Administration also strongly supports the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a cornerstone of our Nation's food assistance safety net, which is why it was not subject to cuts in the President's Budget.  SNAP helps families put food on the table, while also benefitting farm and rural economies.  The Administration also looks forward to working with the Congress to structure reporting requirements and the proposed Research Foundation in ways that will maximize and facilitate agricultural research.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration supports passage of H.R. 674, which would repeal a three percent withholding on certain payments made to private contractors by Federal, State, and local government entities.    The repeal of the withholding requirement in H.R. 674 would reduce a burden on government contractors who otherwise comply with their tax obligations, particularly small businesses.  As evidenced in the President\u2019s proposed American Jobs Act, released September 12, 2011, the Administration has supported alleviating this burden, which was originally enacted into law on May 17, 2006.  The Administration also believes it is important to ensure that Federal contractors are compliant with tax laws and supports more targeted efforts that prevent persons with outstanding tax debts from receiving Federal contracts.  The effect of the repeal of the withholding requirement would be to avoid a decrease in cash flow to these contractors, which would allow them to retain these funds and use them to create jobs and pay suppliers.  This would complement the Administration\u2019s other efforts to help small businesses.  Repeal of the withholding requirement would also reduce implementation costs borne by Federal and other governmental agencies.  The Administration would be willing to work with the Congress to identify acceptable offsets for the budgetary costs associated with the repeal, which could include but are not limited to ones that are in the President\u2019s detailed blueprint outlined to the Congress on September 19, 2011.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2584, making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012.  The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means and reducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  That is why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, supports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, meets the commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their circumstances, and provides for our national security.    The Administration strongly opposes a number of provisions in this bill, including ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the President is presented with a bill that undermines ongoing conservation, public health, and environmental protection efforts through funding limits or restrictions, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.  While overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of ongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership on the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, the Administration has concerns regarding the level of resources the bill would provide for a number of programs in a way that undermines core government functions, investments key to economic growth and job creation, as well as protection of public health and the environment and preservation of our Nation's natural resource heritage, including, but not limited to:  Department of the Interior (DOI)  Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Conservation Grants.  The level of funding provided to the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and State and Tribal Wildlife grants, as well as the termination of Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act grants, would threaten the ability of States and private organizations to conserve and provide access to habitat, undermining the conservation of game and non-game species.   Safety Inspection Fees.  The bill does not include user fees to cover inspections of oil and gas production facilities offshore and onshore.  Without these fees, taxpayers, rather than industry, would have to shoulder the cost of these operations, which are critical to ensuring safe and responsible energy development.  FWS Operations.  The funding provided for operations would seriously degrade the ability of FWS to maintain the network of National Wildlife Refuges and fulfill other statutory responsibilities.  This would result in delays in environmental compliance reviews, which could impede major  infrastructure projects, including road construction, water delivery, and other federally funded projects that directly benefit State and local governments.  Landsat.  The bill does not provide funding to begin the acquisition of the next Landsat satellite, ending a 40-year stream of data that is used by Federal, State, local and Tribal governments and the private sector to make informed land and resource management decisions and to assess the impacts of those decisions over time.  DOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service  Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).  The funding in the bill for LWCF programs would deny willing sellers the opportunity to sell land holdings, and severely impair the ability of Federal, State, and local officials, as well as private landowners, to preserve and manage areas important to wildlife, recreationalists, and sportsmen and women.  Wildland Fire Suppression.  The bill's funding for suppression is substantially below the 10-year average, which is the accepted method for calculating suppression requirements.  While the bill directs DOI and the Forest Service to use emergency fire suppression balances to make up the shortfall, this strategy carries high risk given the high fire activity to date and the cancellation of balances in FY 2011 appropriations.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  EPA Operating Budget.  At the funding level provided, EPA will be unable to implement its core mission of protecting human health and the environment.  Research necessary to support this mission will be curtailed, and restoration of key ecosystems such as the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay will be delayed.  State Revolving Funds (SRFs).  The level of funding provided in the bill would result in approximately 400 fewer wastewater and drinking water projects, and impede EPA's ability to reach the long-term goal of providing approximately 5 percent of total water infrastructure funding annually.  State Categorical Grants.  The funding provided in the bill for grants to States would impede States' ability to carry out critical public health and environmental activities such as air quality monitoring and water quality permitting.  This would greatly reduce core high-priority State environmental programs at a time of declining State budgets.  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Programs.  The reductions in funding for GHG programs and regulations severely limit actions the Administration could take under current law to permit, control, and monitor greenhouse gases and would block EPA's efforts to reduce GHG emissions from vehicles and large stationary sources.  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI).  The level of resources for the GLRI would reduce the ability of Federal agencies and their partners to clean up contaminated sediments, fight invasive species, restore habitat, and improve water quality in this critical ecosystem.  High Priority Ecosystems Funding.  The level of funding provided for the Chesapeake Bay would jeopardize the successful clean-up of the Nation's largest estuary.  2  Responsible Energy Development and Oil Spill Response.  The level of resources in the bill would eliminate efforts to increase the frequency of environmental compliance inspections at oil facilities.  In addition, the bill does not include emergency transfer authority necessary to improve the Government's ability to prevent and respond to oil spills.  Smart Growth.  The bill terminates funding for EPA's Smart Growth program, which contributes to efforts to assist communities in coordinating infrastructure investments and minimizing environmental impact of development.  National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).    The funding in the bill for the NEA, which is the largest national funder of the arts in the United States, would cut support for arts organizations across the country during a time when private and State arts funding is also highly constrained.   Council on Environmental Quality.    The Administration's ability to guide the Executive Branch's environmental policies and programs will be substantially reduced at the funding level in the bill.     The Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language issues that are beyond the scope of funding legislation, including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill:  Restrictions on Implementing the Endangered Species Act.  Preventing FWS from implementing key provisions of the Endangered Species Act will only result in increased costs and delays in the future.  Mountain Top Mining Reform.  Preventing the Office of Surface Mining from developing or implementing the stream buffer zone rule could increase the risk of litigation and potentially delay sustainable coal mining.   Mineral Withdrawal Prohibition.  Prohibiting DOI from restricting new mining claims on approximately 1 million acres of Federal lands near the Grand Canyon will reverse a temporary moratorium on new uranium and other mining claims.  The Secretary of the Interior is currently assessing the impact to water quality in Grand Canyon National Park to ensure that any future uranium or other mining activity in the area does not lead to the human health and environmental impacts seen from previous mining-caused contamination of ground water and drinking water supplies.  Gray Wolves.  The Endangered Species Act expressly gives the public the right to challenge listing decisions.  Restricting judicial review of any published final rule to delist gray wolves in Wyoming or the Great Lakes region from the Endangered Species Act would deny the public an opportunity to make sure that a future listing decision on gray wolves is based on science.  Protecting Wilderness Characteristics Secretarial Order.  Prohibiting the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from implementing Secretarial Order 3310, which directs BLM to use the public resource management planning process to designate certain lands with wilderness characteristics as \"Wild Lands\" is unnecessary given the Department's policy that includes collaboration with stakeholders to identify public lands that may be appropriate candidates for 3  congressional designation under the Wilderness Act.  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Stationary Sources.  Preventing EPA from regulating GHG emissions from stationary sources would prevent the Agency from proposing or finalizing new regulations to control GHG emissions from power plants and petroleum refineries, increasing the risk of long-term environmental consequences from GHG emissions.  EPA is under two settlement agreements to complete these rules in 2012.  Clean Air Act Permitting.  Section 431(a)(2-4) of the bill effectively overrides Federal and State-issued permits for emissions from industrial facilities that are very large emitters of greenhouse gases by stating that the Clean Air Act's requirement to obtain a permit has no legal effect and that no lawsuits may be brought against a facility due to uncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions.    Light-Duty Greenhouse Gas Standards.  Section 453 of the bill undermines Executive Branch efforts to set standards that will save consumers money at the pump and reduce GHG emissions through increased vehicle fuel efficiency on Model Year 2017-2025 Light-Duty Vehicles.  Utility Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT)/Transport Rule.  Section 462 of the bill blocks EPA from implementing its utility MACT rule to control air toxics emissions, as well as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule controlling interstate transport of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions from power plants.  This provision interferes with the long-delayed implementation of major air pollution rules covering pollution from power plants.   Mountaintop Mining Coordination and Guidance.  Section 433 of the bill prohibits implementing or enforcing an EPA/Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)/Office of Surface Mining coordination Memorandum of Understanding and EPA guidance on the Clean Water Act/National Environmental Policy Act and mountaintop mining.  This issue is currently undergoing judicial review and should be allowed to conclude without congressional intervention.    Clean Water Act.  Section 435 of the bill would stop an important Administration effort to provide clarity around which water bodies are covered by the Clean Water Act.  The Administration's work in this area will help to protect the public health and economic benefits provided to the American public by clean water, while also bringing greater certainty to business planning and investment and reducing an ongoing loss of wetlands and other sensitive aquatic resources.  The existing regulations were the subject of two recent Supreme Court cases, in which the Court itself indicated the need for greater regulatory clarity regarding the appropriate scope of the Clean Water Act jurisdiction.   Outer Continental Shelf Drilling.  Section 443 of the bill limits EPA's Clean Air Act permitting authority for Outer Continental Shelf drilling and would eliminate the Agency's discretion in considering human health and environmental protections when issuing these permits.    Integrated Risk Information System.  Section 444 of the bill withholds funding for EPA to take administrative action following its assessment of risk for certain chemicals.  This provision would delay scientific assessment of environmental contaminants and could delay regulatory or other Agency actions designed to protect public health.    Limiting Compliance of the Endangered Species Act.  Section 447 of the bill would prevent EPA from implementing a biological opinion related to pesticides if the opinion identifies modifying, canceling, or suspending registration of a pesticide registered under FIFRA.  This could undermine 4  efforts to protect species from being put into jeopardy from a Federal project and could stop development and delay issuance of permits.  Lead Renovation and Repair Rule.  Section 450 of the bill prohibits funding for EPA to implement the 2008 Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) rule, as amended, until after industry develops and EPA approves different lead paint test kits.  This would undermine efforts to protect sensitive populations from exposure to lead, a known toxin to children and developing fetuses, during home renovation projects. The currently available test kits allow renovators to comply with the 2008 rule.     Reducing Emissions from Cement Facilities.  The language would prevent common sense deployment of technology that has been around for decades that will improve public health by reducing emissions of pollutants, including known carcinogens such as dioxin, from cement facilities.  Fighting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.  Sections 449 and 451 of the bill fall short of their intended purposes of protecting the interest of the Nation's taxpayers.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve the common goal of fighting fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal contracts, grants, and other Federal assistance.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 appropriations process moves forward to ensure the Administration can support enactment of the legislation.  * * * * * * *  5  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 836, which would eliminate the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Emergency Homeowners Loan Program (EHLP).  The Administration is committed to helping struggling American homeowners stay in their homes, and has taken many steps over the last two years to stabilize what was a rapidly-declining housing market.  Over the next 30 months, the EHLP would provide loan assistance to as many as 30,000 distressed American homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to involuntary unemployment, underemployment, or a medical condition.  The Administration believes that the EHLP is an important tool in helping these Americans struggling to stay in their homes.  If the President is presented with H.R. 836, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes the Rules Committee Print of H.R. 7, which includes H.R. 3408, the Protecting Investment in Oil Shale the Next Generation of Environmental, Energy, and Resource Security (PIONEERS Act) and H.R. 3813, the Securing Annuities for Federal Employees Act of 2012.  H.R. 7 does not reflect the historically bipartisan nature of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. The Administration has serious concerns with provisions in the bill that would make America\u2019s roads, rails, and transit systems less safe, reduce the transportation options available to America\u2019s traveling public, short circuit local decision-making, and turn back the clock on environmental and labor protections.  This bill would reduce safety throughout the Nation\u2019s transportation system by failing to make necessary investments in roads and bridges, limiting funding to State and local governments for highway safety, and repealing requirements that help ensure the safe handling of hazardous materials by railroads.  The bill also fails to adequately improve transit safety in accordance with recommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board and legislation submitted by the Administration in December 2009.    H.R. 7 eliminates programs that ensure the Nation\u2019s metropolitan areas have sufficient resources to provide multiple transportation options to help reduce congestion.  H.R. 7 also eliminates a thirty-year legacy of dedicated transit funding from the Highway Trust Fund.  The bill allocates Federal funding for transit in a manner that undermines local decision making regarding the operation of local transit systems.  This bill also reduces authorized funding levels for Amtrak and loosens the requirements on loan programs, putting taxpayer dollars at risk.  In addition, the bill inappropriately targets funding towards systems that carry only a small number of the Nation's bus passengers.  Finally, while the Administration appreciates that the bill does not contain earmarks, H.R. 7 eliminates funding for a number of discretionary grant programs, missing an opportunity to promote competition and innovation.  H.R. 7 would also significantly weaken environmental protections for transportation projects and undermine civic engagement in the decision-making process.  The bill includes arbitrary timelines that deem an environmental and substantive review satisfactory regardless of a project\u2019s complexity and impact. The bill also limits judicial recourse of parties affected by transportation projects in a manner that undermines well-established judicial principles.   The Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas production as part of a broad energy strategy that will protect consumers and reduce the Nation\u2019s dependence on foreign oil.  Unfortunately, the bill includes pay-fors that open up pristine natural habitats not suitable for resource extraction and undermine prudent development of the Nation\u2019s oil and natural gas resources by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to industrial  development, mandating lease sales in new offshore areas with no Secretarial discretion for determining which areas are appropriate and safe for such exploration and development, and preempting a Bureau of Land Management environmental impact statement on oil shale extraction.  Further, this bill seeks to circumvent a longstanding process for determining whether cross-border pipelines are in the national interest by mandating the permitting of the Keystone XL pipeline project despite the fact that the pipeline route has yet to be identified and there is no complete assessment of its potential impacts, including impacts on health and safety, the economy, foreign policy, energy security, and the environment.  The Administration is committed to working on a bipartisan basis on a surface transportation reauthorization bill that provides the necessary funding to modernize the Nation\u2019s surface transportation infrastructure, increase transportation options, maintain and create good paying jobs, and ensure lasting economic competitiveness.  Because this bill jeopardizes safety, weakens environmental and labor protections, and fails to make the investments needed to strengthen the Nation\u2019s roads, bridges, rail, and transit systems, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend that he veto this legislation.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation lives within its means and reducing the deficit so that the Nation can compete in the global economy and win the future.  That is why the President put forth a comprehensive fiscal framework that reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, supports economic growth and long-term job creation, protects critical investments, and meets the commitments made to provide dignity and security to Americans no matter their circumstances.    The Administration strongly opposes a number of provisions in this bill.  If the President is presented with a bill that undermines either the Affordable Care Act or the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act through funding limits or other restrictions, or reverses current policies on Cuba, his senior advisors would recommend a veto.  While overall funding limits and subsequent allocations remain unclear pending the outcome of ongoing bipartisan, bicameral discussions between the Administration and congressional leadership on the Nation's long-term fiscal picture, the Administration has concerns regarding the level of resources the bill would provide for a number of programs in a way that undermines core government functions, investments key to economic growth and job creation, as well as national security, including:  Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The level of funding provided for the IRS would seriously degrade the quality of services provided to taxpayers and would increase the deficit.  Tax enforcement and compliance activities typically return $7 or more on each taxpayer dollar spent.  The bill would erode taxpayer service to the extent that only one out of every two taxpayers would be able to reach an IRS customer service representative, and would lead to over 4,200 full-time staff reductions and reduce overall revenue collections by $4 billion annually, costing taxpayers far more than the near-term savings generated.  Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The level of funding provided in the bill would reduce the Treasury Department's capacity to provide credit, capital, and financial services to low and moderate-income persons and small businesses in underserved communities.  The bill also includes language that could bar CDFI funds from being used for programs such as the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, designed to increase the availability of affordable, healthy food outlets in underserved urban and rural communities where there is little or no access to healthy food.   Financial Research Fund (FRF).  The Administration objects to the funding level for the FRF, as it would compromise oversight and analyses of financial market risks by restricting its independent funding.  FRF supports the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR), as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; undercutting FSOC and OFR resources would impede their ability to identify risks to the financial stability of the Nation, promote market discipline, and respond to emerging threats to the U.S. financial system's stability.  Other Independent Agencies  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The Administration opposes the alteration of CFPB's mandatory funding structure as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which would compromise the Bureau's independence, as well as limitations on the Bureau's expenditures to levels that would severely undercut the agency's statutory responsibility to oversee consumer financial products such as mortgages and credit cards.  Not only would the bill's funding limitation severely curtail hiring and start-up investments that are already underway, but it would also impede supervision, limit the Bureau's consumer response services, prevent the ramping up of citizen financial literacy improvements, and delay the implementation of financial protection programs for older Americans.   Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Administration opposes the funding level for the SEC, which would compromise the Commission's current market oversight and enforcement activities, including policing the securities and derivatives marketplace; undermine the SEC's ability to effectively carry out responsibilities authorized under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and severely compromise critical information technology investments that would prevent fraudulent investment schemes.  Limiting SEC's expenditures does not result in any budgetary savings, since SEC is fully funded by fees on financial transactions and the overall fee level is by statute set to equal the spending level appropriated.  In addition, section 623 of the bill, which bars the SEC from using amounts in its Reserve Fund as authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act, is problematic because it would significantly undermine SEC's ability to fund long-term projects that improve the Commission's efficiency and effectiveness.   Election Assistance Commission (EAC).  The bill would limit EAC's activities to protect the integrity of elections and undermine the agency's role as part of the Nation's election system infrastructure.  Not only would the level of resources provided in the bill require a 50-percent reduction in staff, it would also limit the agency's ability to perform its statutorily required duties, including the certification of voting systems and the maintenance of a clearinghouse of election administration information.    Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The funding level for FCC would make it increasingly difficult to manage its expanded responsibilities, such as auctioning additional spectrum, overseeing mergers, and reforming the Universal Service Fund.  Because FCC is fully funded by fees, this reduction would not save taxpayer dollars.  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  The bill provides inadequate funding for NARA to effectively perform its core operations, including providing Federal agencies and the public with access to Federal Government records in paper, electronic, and other forms.    2  Executive Office of the President (EOP)  EOP Funding.  The level of resources provided in the bill would significantly impact the EOP's role in assisting the President in carrying out his constitutional duties as head of the Executive Branch, including protecting national security interests, developing policies to address the challenges facing the Nation, reducing the deficit and spending taxpayer dollars more cost-effectively, and managing the Federal agencies.   General Services Administration (GSA)  Federal Buildings Fund.  The bill provides insufficient resources to operate the existing GSA buildings portfolio, including lease payments to private lessors, utility payments, and janitorial services.  The bill also provides no resources for high priority capital projects including several modernization projects that would increase efficiency and reduce costs.  Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  OPM's New Statutory Responsibilities.  The funding level provided by the bill would limit OPM's ability to implement and administer new statutory responsibilities.   The bill includes the following problematic policy and language issues that are beyond the scope of funding legislation:   Department of the Treasury.  The Administration opposes sections 107 and 108 of the bill, which would place significant restrictions on the Department's ability to adequately implement the Affordable Care Act, and would delay the planning and construction of a system to administer the critical premium assistance tax credit and the ability to reconcile it with IRS's core systems.  These sections would prevent both appropriated and transferred funds from the Department of Health and Human Services from being used by the Department to administer the law.  Office of Financial Stability (OFS).  Section 127 of the bill would set an unprecedented limit on appropriated expenditure by OFS, which would severely limit OFS's ability to effectively and efficiently administer the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), including protecting taxpayer investments held by TARP and providing housing program support.  Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP).  Section 129 of the bill would terminate HAMP and thereby increase the number of avoidable foreclosures, as many struggling homeowners would no longer have an opportunity to reduce their mortgage payments to a sustainable level through the program.  HAMP has greatly contributed to standardizing the treatment of millions of delinquent home loans, bringing greater certainty to struggling homeowners.  It is a key tool to stabilizing the housing market by preventing avoidable foreclosures, protecting home values, and preserving homeownership.  Presidential Election Campaign Fund.  Section 620 of the bill would effectively terminate the Nation's Presidential election public financing system, expanding the power of corporations and special interests in the Nation's elections.  This language would force many candidates into an endless cycle of fundraising at the expense of engagement with voters on the issues, and would place a premium on access to large donor or special interest support, narrowing the field of otherwise worthy candidates.   3  Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  Section 621 of the bill would prohibit the FCC from promoting open Internet practices that prevent unnecessary discrimination across content carried by Internet service providers.  The FCC has carefully crafted rules to promote competition while balancing the technical needs of Internet providers.  District of Columbia Needle Exchange Restriction.  Section 807 of the bill restricts the use of Federal funds for the District's needle exchange programs.  This is contrary to current practice and the Administration\u2019s policy to allow funds to be used in locations where local authorities deem needle exchange programs to be effective and appropriate.  District of Columbia Abortion Restriction.  Section 810 of the bill prevents the District of Columbia from using its own funds for abortions, which undermines the principle of states' rights and of D.C. home rule.  Longstanding Federal policy already prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  Consumer Product Safety Commission's (CPSC's) Product Safety Database.  Section 622 of the bill prohibits the use of funds for CPSC's public product safety database, SaferProducts.gov.  This website allows the public to submit and review reports of harm or risk of harm related to the use of consumer products, and it also allows manufacturers to respond directly to each report. The funding restriction, which will eliminate the database, is inconsistent with the Administration's transparency goals, limiting the information available to consumers and manufacturers about hazardous or potentially hazardous products.   Fighting Fraud, Waste, and Abuse.  The Administration is concerned with sections 740 and 741 of the bill and looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve the intended purpose of protecting the interest of the Nation's taxpayers, which is consistent with the Administration's efforts to fight fraud, waste, and abuse in Federal contracts, grants, and other Federal assistance.  Cuban Family Travel and Remittances.  The Administration opposes section 901 of the bill, which would reverse the President's policy on family travel and remittances to Cuba.  This section would undo the President's efforts to increase contact between divided Cuban families, undermine the enhancement of the Cuban people's economic independence and support for private sector activity in Cuba that come from increased remittances from family members, and therefore isolate the Cuban people and make them more dependent on Cuban authorities.  Constitutional Concerns.  Multiple provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  Section 203 would prohibit the use of funds for officers or employees of the Executive Office of the President \"to prepare, sign, or approve statements abrogating legislation passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate and signed by the President.\"  Contrary to the implication of section 203, Presidential signing statements do not abrogate legislation.  They indicate how the Executive Branch will apply acts of the Congress to ensure faithful execution of the laws.  To the extent section 203 purports to prevent the President from making use of his immediate aides in the Executive Office of the President to prepare any statement articulating the conclusion that a particular provision of law is unconstitutional and therefore will not be executed, in whole or in part, this provision would impermissibly encroach upon the President's constitutional authority to execute and interpret Federal laws, including the Constitution.  Section 632 would prohibit the use of funds for several positions that involve providing advice directly to the President. It also would deny funding for any \"substantially similar positions.\"  As the President indicated in an April 15, 2011 statement regarding virtually identical provisions in prior legislation, the President has well-established authority to supervise and oversee the Executive Branch, and to obtain advice in 4  furtherance of this supervisory authority.  The President also has the prerogative to obtain advice that will assist him in carrying out his constitutional responsibilities, and do so not only from Executive Branch officials and employees outside the White House, but also from advisors within it.  Finally, Section 713 is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch to disclose, without discretion, certain classified and other privileged information, in which case it would intrude on the President's discharge of his constitutional authorities.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the fiscal year 2012 appropriations process moves forward to ensure the Administration can support enactment of the legislation.  * * * * * * *  5  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5325, making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2013, and for other purposes.    Last summer, the Congress and the President came to a bipartisan agreement to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal course in enacting the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA).  The BCA created a framework for more than $2 trillion in deficit reduction and provided tight spending caps that would bring discretionary spending to a minimum level needed to preserve critical national priorities.  Departing from the bipartisan agreement reached in the BCA and departing from these caps, the House of Representatives put forward a topline discretionary funding level for FY 2013 that, for example, would cost jobs and hurt average Americans, especially seniors, veterans, and children \u2013 as well as degrade many of the basic Government services on which the American people rely, such as air traffic control and law enforcement.  In addition, these cuts were made in the context of a budget that fails the test of balance, fairness, and shared responsibility by giving millionaires and billionaires a tax cut and paying for it through deep cuts, including to discretionary programs.  Taking this into account, passing H.R. 5325 at its current funding level would mean that when the Congress constructs other appropriations bills, it would necessitate significant and harmful cuts to critical national priorities such as education, research and development, job training, and health care.  Furthermore, this bill undermines key investments in clean energy and scientific research and development, building blocks of our Nation's future economy.  Investing in these areas is critical to the Nation's economic growth, security, and global competitiveness.  The Administration also strongly objects to the inclusion of ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.   If the President were presented with H.R. 5325, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Energy (DOE)  Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA\u2013E).  The Administration strongly opposes the  reduction in funding for ARPA\u2013E.  The bill provides $200 million for the program, which is $150 million below the FY 2013 Budget request and $75 million below the FY 2012 enacted level.  ARPA\u2013E funds early stage, transformative energy technology research that industry, by itself, is unlikely to support.  Investments in ARPA\u2013E are aimed at ensuring that the Nation remains at the forefront of new energy technology development to ensure the United States remains a lead competitor in this area.  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided for EERE, which is $886 million below the FY 2013 Budget request and $428 million less than the FY 2012 enacted level. The current funding in the bill would be the lowest level of funding for EERE since FY 2006, leaving U.S. competitiveness at risk in new markets and clean energy industries such as advanced vehicles, advanced manufacturing, energy efficiency for homes and businesses, and domestic renewable energy such as wind, solar, and biomass.  This level cuts funding for solar energy and for building energy efficiency nearly in half from the FY 2012 enacted level.  Office of Science.  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding in the bill for the Office of Science, which is $191 million below the FY 2013 Budget request and $73 million below the FY 2012 enacted level. The funding provided would hinder important research underpinning U.S. innovation in clean energy technologies and applications.  The Office of Science also funds basic research across a broad spectrum of physical, biological, and environmental sciences.  Reductions in support for these areas may lead to a loss of U.S. leadership in many areas of science.   Energy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration urges the House to fully fund EIA, which will allow the agency to continue to provide independent and rigorous analysis of America's energy markets, including important national energy consumption and production data.  This level is also necessary to improve the security of procedures and data delivery methods for reports, such as weekly oil stock reports, that can move market prices. The bill currently provides $100 million, which is $16 million below the FY 2013 Budget request and $5 million less than the FY 2012 enacted level.  National Nuclear Security Administration.  The Administration greatly appreciates the Committee's support for Presidential initiatives to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and to maintain a robust deterrent.  This support will help continue efforts to secure nuclear materials in four years, maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear stockpile through stockpile stewardship and life extensions, recapitalize the aging infrastructure of the nuclear enterprise, and develop a reactor for the Ohio Class replacement submarine.  Statutory by Reference Provision.  The Administration urges the House to remove section 301(c) of the bill, which incorporates the text as well as the specific funding directions of the House report into the statute by reference.  There are multiple provisions in the report language that could be problematic or otherwise counter to the specific activities laid out in the FY 2013 Budget.  In addition, enactment of this provision would limit flexibility and efficiency in execution.   Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)  Overall Funding and New Starts.  The Administration urges the House to reduce the overall level of 2  funding to that requested in the FY 2013 Budget, and to reallocate funds to restore funding requested for several priority programs and initiatives.  These priority programs include the start of construction work on an important new program to reverse damage to the coastal Louisiana ecosystem and other priority new construction starts; a study requested by the Congress to examine flood risks nationwide to improve existing programs; and the restoration of $15 million to the Corps' regulatory program, so it can process permit applications in a timely manner.  Inland Waterways.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued strong support for cost-sharing of inland waterways capital investments.  The Administration also urges the House to include the general provision proposed in the FY 2013 Budget to increase the total authorized cost for the Olmsted Locks and Dam project.  Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation  San Joaquin River Restoration.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's elimination of funding for this program, which would undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts.  Policy Riders  The Administration strongly opposes problematic policy and language riders including, but not limited to, the following provisions in this bill:  Yucca Mountain.  Section 508 of the bill would prohibit using funds made available by the bill for any actions related to the Administration's plan for Yucca Mountain, such as closing the application process.  DOE Weatherization Assistance Program.  Section 307 of the bill permanently blocks existing Weatherization Assistance Program authorizations, reducing the efficiency of the program by lowering the maximum income level for retrofit assistance eligibility, the maximum financial assistance per weatherized home, and the maximum allocation allowed for Training and Technical Assistance from current levels.  Fossil-fuel generated energy consumption reduction.  Section 311 would prevent funding for the development and implementation of a rule to improve energy efficiency and reduce reliance on fossil fuels in Federal buildings, and would hinder the Administration's ability to improve the efficiency of Federal buildings and reduce harmful greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions.  Clean Water Act (CWA).  Section 110 of the bill would stop an Administration effort to provide clarity on which water bodies are covered by CWA.  The existing regulations were the subject of two Supreme Court cases in 2001 and 2006, in which the Court indicated the need for greater regulatory clarity on the scope of CWA jurisdiction.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2013 appropriations process moves forward.   * * * * * * * 3  ", "The Administration strongly supports passage of S. 3187, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which will help speed safe and effective drugs, medical devices and biosimilar biological products to patients.  Building on proposals developed by the Administration in partnership with the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and consumer groups, S. 3187 reauthorizes the prescription drug and medical device user fee programs as well as creates new user fee programs for biosimilar biological products and generic drugs.  The biosimilar approval pathway was created by the Affordable Care Act, and the generic drug user fee program was proposed in the 2013 President's Budget to help increase patient access to affordable medicines.    S. 3187 also enhances the tools available to the Food and Drug Administration to address drug shortages by requiring additional early notification of potential shortages, an action the Administration called for in the 2011 Executive Order on drug shortages.  In addition, provisions in the bill help address the challenges of globalization by enhancing the safety of the drug supply chain, increase incentives for the development of new antibiotics, renew and enhance mechanisms to ensure that children's medicines are appropriately tested and labeled, and expedite the development and review of certain drugs for treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions.  Promoting innovation, safety, and access to medicines and devices is critical to the Nation's health, and the Administration supports this bipartisan legislation that contributes to this goal.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2560, the \u201cCut, Cap and Balance Act of 2011.\u201d  Neither setting arbitrary spending levels nor amending the Constitution is necessary to restore fiscal responsibility.  Increasing the Federal debt limit, which is needed to avoid a Federal government default on its obligations and a severe blow to the economy, should not be conditioned on taking these actions.  Instead of pursuing an empty political statement and unrealistic policy goals, it is necessary to move beyond politics as usual and find bipartisan common ground.  The bill would undercut the Federal Government\u2019s ability to meet its core commitments to seniors, middle-class families and the most vulnerable, while reducing our ability to invest in our future.  H. R. 2560 would set unrealistic spending caps that could result in significant cuts to education, research and development, and other programs critical to growing our economy and winning the future.  It could also lead to severe cuts in Medicare and Social Security, which are growing to accommodate the retirement of the baby boomers, and put at risk the retirement security for tens of millions of Americans.  Furthermore, H. R. 2560 could require even deeper cuts, since it conditions an increase in the Federal debt limit on Congressional passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment.  H. R. 2560 sets out a false and unacceptable choice between the Federal Government defaulting on its obligations now or, alternatively, passing a Balanced Budget Amendment that, in the years ahead, will likely leave the Nation unable to meet its core commitment of ensuring dignity in retirement.  The President has proposed a comprehensive and balanced framework that ensures we live within our means and reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, while supporting economic growth and long-term job creation, protecting critical investments, and meeting the commitments made to provide economic security to Americans no matter their circumstances.  H.R. 2560 is inconsistent with this responsible framework to restore fiscal responsibility and is not an appropriate method of reducing the Nation\u2019s deficits and debt.  The Administration is committed to working with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to achieve real solutions.   If the President were presented this bill for signature, he would veto it.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2343 to prevent interest rates from doubling for over 7 million college students in the coming year.  On July 1st, absent Congressional action that the Administration can support, the interest rate on new subsidized Federal Direct Stafford Loans for undergraduate students is set to double, from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent.  Taking action to stop the doubling of these rates will save students $1,000, on average, over the life of their loans.  As the economy continues to recover, and at a time when market interest rates are at historic lows, students who rely on loans to finance postsecondary education should not be burdened with additional college debt as they seek to graduate, launch a career or a business, start a family, or buy a house.  The Administration is pleased that S. 2343 would offset the costs of maintaining the interest rate at 3.4 percent in a fiscally responsible manner.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas production as part of a broad energy strategy that will protect consumers and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.  Safety and environmental reforms that the Administration implemented in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill are critical to achieving those objectives.  These reforms strengthen requirements for issues ranging from well design to workplace safety to corporate accountability, and they require operators to show that they can contain a subsea oil spill like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The Administration opposes         H.R. 1230 and H.R. 1229, as reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources, both of which would undercut these critical reforms.   H.R. 1230 would undermine the Administration's work to ensure that environmental analysis required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is conducted in a rigorous manner.  H.R. 1230 would hastily open areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic to leasing, including requiring the Department of the Interior (DOI) to hold three lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico using outdated NEPA analysis that was conducted before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The Administration has strengthened NEPA analysis in light of lessons learned from the spill.  DOI intends to hold all three Gulf of Mexico lease sales referenced in the bill by mid-2012.      H.R. 1229 would constrain the ability of DOI to ensure that permits meet safety standards by requiring permitting decisions to be made within 30 days of receiving an application \u2013 thereby curtailing the review period.  Two 15 day extensions would be possible, though DOI would be required to submit burdensome justifications.  The bill would grant permits automatically at the end of this 60 day window, regardless of whether the applicant satisfied safety standards.  The Administration believes these statutory time constraints are unwarranted.  Fifty-one new shallow water permits have been issued since the Administration\u2019s stronger safety standards were put in place, and deepwater permit applications also are being processed in a timely manner.  Since the end of February, when industry first demonstrated to safety regulators the capability to contain a subsea spill, twelve deepwater wells have been permitted.  H.R. 1229 would also require the Secretary of the Interior to grant an automatic one-year suspension of leases (effectively extending the term of the lease) in the Gulf of Mexico.  The Administration fully supports suspensions for Gulf of Mexico leaseholders directly impacted by the drilling moratorium.  Ten such suspensions have already been granted using administrative procedures to leaseholders who demonstrated that they were affected by the moratoria.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee's continued support of our national defense and supports a number of the provisions in H.R. 4310, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.  In particular, the Administration appreciates the support of the Committee for authorities that assist the ability of the warfighter to operate in unconventional and irregular warfare, counter unconventional threats, or support contingency or stability operations.  The Administration is disappointed, however, with the many provisions in this bill that impede the ability of the Secretary of Defense to carry out the 2012 defense strategic guidance.   While there are a number of areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration has serious concerns with provisions that:  (1) depart from the President's fiscal year (FY) 2013 Budget request \u2013 in particular, increases to the topline request for the base budget; (2) constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to carry out their missions consistent with the new defense strategy; or (3) impede the ability of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy to make and implement management decisions that eliminate unnecessary overhead or programs to ensure scarce resources are directed to the highest priorities for the national security.  The overall funding level supported by H.R. 4310 would violate the Budget Control Act of 2011, the bipartisan agreement reached between the Congress and the President to put the Nation on a sustainable fiscal course.  If the cumulative effects of the bill impede the ability of the Administration to execute the new defense strategy and to properly direct scarce resources, the President's senior advisors would recommend to the President that he veto the bill.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.  As well, the Administration looks forward to reviewing a classified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns on classified programs.  Limitations on Nuclear Force Reductions and Nuclear Employment Strategy:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1053-1059, which would impinge on the President's ability to implement the New START Treaty and to set U.S. nuclear weapons policy.  In particular, sections 1053 and 1055 would set onerous conditions on the Administration's ability to implement the Treaty, and section 1058 would set onerous conditions on the President's ability to retire, dismantle, or eliminate non-deployed nuclear weapons.  Further, section 1054 raises constitutional concerns as it appears to encroach on the President's authority as Commander in Chief to set nuclear employment policy \u2013 a right exercised by every president in the nuclear age from both parties.  If the final bill presented to the President includes these provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  Detainee Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1035-1043, which would  continue and in some cases expand unwise restrictions that would constrain the flexibility that our Nation's armed forces and counterterrorism professionals need to deal with evolving threats.  Section 1035, which would prohibit any detainee who has been repatriated to Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, or the Republic of Palau from traveling to the U.S., is unnecessary and could undermine our relations with a friendly government whose citizens may serve in the U.S. military.  Sections 1036, 1037, 1038, and 1043 unnecessarily renew, supplement, or enhance the restrictions on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States or a foreign country.  The Administration continues to strongly oppose these provisions, which intrude upon the Executive branch\u2019s ability to carry out its military, national security, and foreign relations activities and to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees.  Likewise, the Administration opposes the notice and reporting requirements in sections 1040, 1041, and 1042, which would unnecessarily complicate and potentially compromise military operations and detention practices \u2013 including aboard naval vessels at sea.  These sections, like section 1039, would also greatly add to the military\u2019s administrative burden.  Section 1041 is an unprecedented, unwarranted, and misguided intrusion into the military\u2019s detention operations in a foreign combat theater during an active armed conflict.  The reporting requirements seek to micromanage the decisions of experienced military commanders and diplomats, threaten to compromise the Executive\u2019s ability to act swiftly and flexibly during a critical time for transition in Afghanistan, and could deter or jeopardize the success of effective foreign prosecutions.  Sections 1036, 1037, and 1041, moreover, would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  If the final bill presented to the President includes provisions that challenge critical executive branch authority, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   TRICARE Fees and Co-Payments:  The Administration agrees that retirees deserve a quality health care benefit.  For this very reason, the Administration strongly supports its requested TRICARE fee initiatives that seek to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense (DOD) while keeping retired beneficiaries' share of these costs well below the levels experienced when the TRICARE program was implemented in the mid-1990s.  The projected FY 2013 TRICARE savings of $1.8 billion and $12.9 billion through FY 2017 are essential for DOD to successfully address rising personnel costs.  DOD needs these savings to balance and maintain investments for key defense priorities.  The Administration is very disappointed that the Committee did not support the proposed TRICARE fee increases and included section 718, which, while supporting some fee increases, caps them at levels below those allowed under current law and below the requested authorization.  If section 718 remains in the bill, it would only provide five year savings of $2.6 billion.  Limitations on Retirement of Weapon Systems:  The Administration strongly objects to provisions that would restrict retirements of C-27J, C-23, C-130, and other aircraft and the RQ-4 Global Hawk Block 30.  These provisions would force DOD to operate, sustain, and maintain aircraft that are in excess of national requirements and are not affordable in an austere budget environment.  Retaining large numbers of under-resourced aircraft in the fleet in today's fiscally constrained environment would significantly increase the risk of a hollow force.  The Administration also objects to provisions that would restrict retirements of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines and certain Ticonderoga Class Cruisers (CGs) and Dock Landing Ships (LSDs).  The requirement to maintain a minimum of 12 ballistic missile submarines in the fleet would limit the Secretary of the Navy's ability to manage Naval strategic forces to balance risk across the total Naval battle force, and to ensure scarce resources are directed to the highest priorities of the Combatant Commanders.  The requirement to retain CGs and LSDs without associated funding for manning, repair, maintenance, and modernization over the remainder of their service lives places the Navy at greater 2  risk of hollowing out the fleet.  Finally, the Administration objects to section 1076, which would prevent the retirement of the C-23 aircraft in FY 2013.  As of January 27, 2012, when the Army transferred the mission to conduct time sensitive/mission critical cargo and personnel to the Air Force, the Army no longer has a mission for a fixed wing cargo aircraft.  Delaying the divestment of the C-23 aircraft into FY 2016 and beyond would cost $343.5 million for modernization and service life extension on the aircraft.  In the current constrained budget environment, a congressional requirement to maintain systems that are outside the scope of the Nation's security requirements is irresponsible.  Limitations on End-Strength Reductions for the Army and Marine Corps:  The Administration strongly objects to section 403, which would limit active duty end-strength reductions for the Army and Marine Corps in FYs 2014-2017 to 15,000 and 5,000 per year, respectively, and would require DOD to fund all Army and Marine Corps active duty end strength in the base budget and not through emergency, supplemental, or overseas contingency operations (OCO) funds.  The timing and pace of the planned reductions to the Army and Marine Corps are tied to anticipated changes in operational demand based on the Nation's current commitments as well as the new defense strategy, which emphasizes a smaller and leaner force.  Limiting the Army's budgeted end-strength reductions to 15,000 per year is estimated to increase military personnel and health care costs by over $500 million in FY 2014 and $1.9 billion through FY 2017.  Where non-enduring end strength above 490,000 for the Army and 182,100 for the Marine Corps is maintained between FY 2014 and FY 2017, it is because of current contingency operations and, therefore, appropriately funded in the OCO portion of the DOD budget request.  The Administration also strongly opposes provisions mandating an end strength for the Army at 552,000 in FY 2013 and excluding Service members in the Integrated Disability Evaluation Systems from FY 2013 active duty end-strength authorized levels.  To comply with this legislation, the Army would need to significantly increase accessions and retention far beyond what is currently planned to meet the minimum end strength.   Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC):  The Administration strongly objects to section 2713, which would prohibit DOD from spending any funds to propose or plan for additional rounds of BRAC, and sections 2712, 2867, and 2868, which seek to freeze certain Air Force command structures, capabilities, and functions as they existed in  2011.  Together, these sections appear to impinge on Executive branch prerogatives to plan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration is concerned that the House has not authorized additional BRAC rounds so that DOD may properly align the military's infrastructure with the needs of our evolving force structure, which is critical to ensuring that limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and the national security.   Protection of Certain Religious and Moral Beliefs:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 536 and 537 because those provisions adopt unnecessary and ill-advised policies that would inhibit the ability of same-sex couples to marry or enter a recognized relationship under State law.  Section 536 would prohibit all personnel-related actions based on certain religious and moral beliefs, which, in its overbroad terms, is potentially harmful to good order and discipline.  Section 537 would obligate DOD to deny Service members, retirees, and their family members access to facilities for religious ceremonies on the basis of sexual orientation, a troublesome and potentially unconstitutional limitation on religious liberty.   Missile Defense:  The Administration appreciates the support for DOD's air and missile defense programs, as well as the support for the Government of Israel to purchase additional Iron Dome 3  missile systems.  However, the Administration strongly objects to sections 223, 230, 1236, 2204(b), and 2403(b), as well as the Committee's $75 million reduction to the authorization of appropriation in section 4601 for the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense System Complex, respectively.  These provisions would jeopardize the implementation of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) to missile defense and limit the ability to protect the United States, deployed U.S. Forces, allies, and partners.  Section 223, which would require a missile defense site on the East Coast of the United States, is premature because the Administration has not identified a requirement for a third U.S.-based missile defense site, nor assessed the feasibility or cost in a cost-constrained environment.  This section also would mandate the inclusion of a plan to deploy an appropriate missile defense interceptor for such a site in the budget request for FY 2014, an unwarranted intrusion on Executive branch decision making.  Sections 230, 2204(b), and 2403(b) would limit funding for missile defense equipment and construction supporting the EPAA \u2013 the U.S. voluntary national contribution to NATO missile defense \u2013 thereby hindering its implementation and limiting protection of U.S. Forces, allies, and partners in NATO Europe.  Finally, section 1236 would unnecessarily impede the President's exclusive authority to conduct discussions with the Russian Federation on cooperative missile defense matters both bilaterally and in the NATO context, would limit the reciprocal exchange of data that could benefit U.S. and allied security, and would be impractical to implement.  Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS):  The Administration strongly objects to section 229, which would prohibit the use of funds for the MEADS program.  If the Congress does not appropriate FY 2013 funding, there is a high likelihood that this action would be perceived by our partners Italy and Germany as breaking our commitment under the Memorandum of Understanding, and could harm our relationship with our Allies on a much broader basis, including future multinational cooperative projects.  It also could prevent the completion of the agreed Proof of Concept activities, which would provide data archiving, analysis of testing, and software development necessary to harvest technology from U.S. and partner investments in MEADS.  Extended Deterrent in Europe:  The Administration strongly objects, including on constitutional grounds, to the elements of section 1060 that would limit the President\u2019s ability to determine U.S. military requirements in Europe, negotiate treaties and otherwise conduct diplomacy, and maintain the confidentiality of sensitive diplomatic communications.  This section would inhibit our ability to function within NATO.  The Administration also objects to this section\u2019s limitation on Administration efforts to address tactical (non-strategic) nuclear weapons, a step called for in the Senate's Resolution of Ratification of the New START Treaty and a priority of U.S. arms control policy.   Military Operations:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1221 and 1222, which would require DOD to prepare and submit a plan to augment the presence of the U.S. Fifth Fleet in the Middle East and to conduct military activities in that region.  Taken together, these provisions would infringe upon the President's prerogative to plan for military activities, including the deployment of U.S. Forces.  Section 1221 also purports to declare U.S. policy toward Iran, challenging the President's well-established constitutional prerogatives with respect to U.S. foreign policy.  The Administration also objects to section 1222, which would micromanage the President's decisions as Commander-in-Chief regarding the deployment of U.S. Forces.  Military Activities in Cyberspace:  The Administration agrees that appropriate military operations in cyberspace are a vital component of national security, but objects to section 941, which seeks to clarify military authority to conduct clandestine cyber operations.  The Administration has concerns 4  about this provision and wants to work with the Congress to ensure that any such legislation adds clarity and value to our efforts in cyberspace.  Prohibition on Use of Funds to Implement International Agreement on Space Activities that Have Not Been Ratified by the Senate or Authorized by Statute:  The Administration strongly objects to section 913, which prohibits the expenditure of funds by the Secretary of Defense or the Director of National Intelligence to implement or comply with an international agreement concerning outer space activities unless such agreement is ratified by the Senate or authorized by statute.  The Administration is participating in the development of a non-legally binding International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities (Code), which is not an international agreement concerning outer space activities.  The Code would not impose any legal obligations on the United States, nor would it restrict the exercise of the U.S.'s rights of individual and collective self-defense.  Instead, it would enhance U.S. national security by encouraging responsible space behavior and singling out those who act otherwise, reducing the risk of misunderstanding and misconduct in space.  The Administration is concerned that this provision would create confusion about the legal status of the Code and lead our international partners to conclude that the U.S. will treat the Code as an international agreement, greatly complicating negotiations.  Furthermore, section 913 encroaches on the Executive's exclusive authority to conduct foreign relations and could severely hamper U.S. ability to conduct bilateral space cooperation activities with key allies.    Department of Energy (DOE) and Contractor Management Relationships:  The Administration strongly objects to elements of sections 1061 and 1062 and certain provisions of Title 31 that change the responsibilities, authorities, and reporting requirements between and among DOE, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), contractors managing and operating the national laboratories, the President, and the Congress.  Some of these changes fundamentally alter the relationship between DOE and NNSA by restricting the authority of the Secretary of Energy and transferring responsibilities from DOE to NNSA.  The bill also:  (1) legislates the establishment of a council of the national laboratory contractors with the authority to make unrestricted recommendations to NNSA, which then mandate a response by NNSA; (2) takes authority for final approval of the NNSA budget submission away from the President;  (3) requires NNSA to submit a cost-benefit analysis to the Congress before competing a management and operating contract, which would undermine a long-standing and bipartisan effort to increase competition in government contracting; and (4) authorizes unrestricted access for the contractors to report to the Congress on Administration activities.  Health and Safety at DOE and NNSA:  The Administration strongly opposes sections 3202, 3115, 3113, and 3151.  These provisions severely hamper external, independent oversight by the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board; move regulatory authority from independent offices and agencies to the NNSA Administrator; require a weaker standard of contractor governance, management, and oversight; and eliminate DOE's flexibility to determine the appropriate means of assessing the unique risks that it confronts in its facilities.  By lowering safety standards for the nuclear weapons complex and reducing requested funding for health, safety, and security, these provisions would weaken protections for workers and the general public.    NNSA Staffing:  Section 3111 would direct the Administration to make large reductions within the NNSA in its number of Federal employees.  The NNSA is undertaking major, complex efforts to move to a more efficient and effective management of the nuclear security complex while maintaining the safety, security, and effectiveness of our nuclear arsenal.  The Administration believes that the NNSA is best positioned to prescribe the proper level of staffing to fulfill those 5  missions effectively within the budget appropriated by the Congress.  Unwarranted Disclosure of Internal Executive Branch Information:  The Administration objects to section 953, which would require DOD to provide to the Congress the Administration's internal planning and guidance information, and section 1077, which could be construed to interfere with DOD's ability to control the release of information related to internal deliberations on matters such as budget and program decisions and treaty negotiations.  Incremental Funding:  The bill would provide incremental funding for major programs rather than the full funding and advance appropriations that the Administration requested.  Although the Administration supports the underlying programs, the Administration strongly opposes the use of incremental funding for the VIRGINIA class attack submarine and the Space-Based Infrared System satellites because incremental funding undermines program stability and cost discipline.    Unified Medical Command:  The Administration strongly objects to section 711, which would require the President to create a new unified combatant command for medical operations of the military health system.  DOD completed a study on how to best deliver high-quality medical care to Service members and their families in an effective and cost-efficient manner.  The study, submitted to the Congress, was reviewed in detail by the most senior civilian and military leaders of the Department, who determined that a Unified Medical Command was not the proper course of action for DOD.  Section 711 would preclude DOD from properly structuring itself to accomplish the most efficient and effective improvement to the current Military Health System.  The Administration also objects to section 719, which would require DOD to implement as-yet-unknown recommendations from a report by the U.S. Comptroller General prior to making changes to the structure of the Military Health System.  Requirements to Develop or Maintain Unnecessary Capabilities:  The Administration objects to section 352, which would require the Secretary of the Air Force to maintain operational capabilities at 18 aerospace control alert sites.  After an extensive analysis, DOD determined that it was possible to reduce the routine aerospace control alert posture at two sites without exposing the United States to undue risk based on the current threat.  The Administration also objects to section 211, which would require the Long Range Strike Bomber to be certified to use strategic nuclear weapons as a precondition for declaring initial operational capability (IOC).  This requirement would unnecessarily delay conventional weapons IOC.    Limitation on Reimbursement of the Government of Pakistan:  The Administration strongly objects to the restriction in reimbursement for Pakistan from Coalition Support Funds and the associated certification requirements in section 1211.  Taken together, the reimbursement restriction and the certification restrictions - some of which require the Secretary of Defense to certify Pakistani cooperation on issues outside of his purview - are proposed at a particularly sensitive time and would severely constrict DOD's ability to respond to emergent war-time coalition support requirements, putting at risk the success of our campaign in Afghanistan, and increasing the risk that al-Qaida and its associates would be able to again enjoy a safe haven in Pakistan.  Use of Private Security Contractors:  The Administration understands the aims of the provision, but strongly objects to section 1214, which would limit the Secretary of Defense's options to provide security for members of the Armed Forces and military installations and facilities in Afghanistan and would undermine the coalition's efforts to encourage Afghan assumption of sovereign duties.  If enacted, this section will require either additional troops to perform security functions or a reduction 6  in combat missions that current force levels perform.  It could also undermine civilian-military coordination and increase risk for certain development projects that are critical to ensuring a stable Afghanistan through the transition period to 2014.  Extension and Expansion of Authority to Acquire Products and Services Produced in Countries Along a Major Route of Supply to Afghanistan:  The Administration objects to language included in section 821, which would limit the use of expanded procurement authority to only those Northern Distribution Network (NDN) countries that agree to permit the transport of coalition personnel, equipment, and supplies.  This restriction would hamper DOD's attempts at local procurement along the NDN and would impact transit agreements that the United States already has negotiated with several countries along the NDN.  Alternative Fuels:  The Administration objects to sections 313 and 314, which would affect DOD's ability to procure alternative fuels and would further increase American reliance on fossil fuels, thereby contributing to geopolitical instability and endangering our interests abroad.    Abrams/Bradley Upgrades:  The Administration objects to $321 million of unrequested authorization in section 4101, lines 005 and 012 for unneeded upgrades to the M-1 Abrams tank and M-2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles in a fiscally-constrained environment.   Purple Hearts for Fort Hood and Little Rock Victims:  The Administration objects to section 552, which would grant Purple Hearts to the victims of the shooting incidents in Fort Hood, Texas, and Little Rock, Arkansas.  The criminal acts that occurred in Little Rock were tried by the State of Arkansas as violations of the State criminal code rather than as acts of terrorism; as a result, this provision could create appellate issues.  Veterans Memorial Object Transfer:  The Administration objects to section 355, which would prohibit the return of veterans' memorial objects without specific authorization in law.  This provision would restrict the President's ability to take actions to demonstrate goodwill toward foreign allies and partners by lending or giving historical artifacts in instances where doing so would serve the national security interests of the United States.  Retroactive Liability for Closed Non-BRAC DOD Installations:  The Administration objects to section 2813, which would mandate DOD to indemnify anyone who acquired ownership or control of DOD property at any military installation closed outside the BRAC process after October 24, 1988 against costs or claims arising from environmental conditions.  The provision would retroactively expose DOD to new and costly claims and undermine the equity to the United States of the terms and conditions negotiated in good faith with purchasers when the property was originally conveyed.  Property transferees are already protected by the deed covenants DOD is required to provide under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.  National Guard Center of Excellence:  The Administration opposes section 334, which would create a Center of Excellence (COE) for the National Guard State Partnership Program to provide training to units and members of the active and reserve components to implement the State Partnership Program.  This provision would create a duplicative training program, as it would authorize training within the core competencies of the National Guard, which already occurs within existing DOD organizations.  In addition, the provision would require additional resources to fund the full-time personnel to command and administer the COE, provide the training, and fund the partnerships with 7  universities and other institutions where some of the training would take place.  Small Business Contracting:  The Administration strongly supports efforts to increase Federal contracting with small businesses, but opposes section 1631, which would establish a laudable but overly ambitious government-wide small business procurement goal and unrealistic individual agency goals that could undermine the goals process and take away the Government\u2019s ability to focus its efforts where opportunities for small business contractors are greatest.  In addition, the Administration objects to the level of complexity that section 1671 would add to the process for evaluating contract bundling, which will encourage a needless increase in litigation and place unnecessary constraints on agencies in making determinations that bundling is necessary and justified.  Other Provisions Authorizing Activities with Partner Nations:  The Administration objects to section 1532, which would limit activities of the Task Force on Business and Stability Operations (TFBSO) to only mining and natural resources industry development and reduces funding to $50 million.  The TFBSO has developed a unique capability to foster and expand business opportunities within Afghanistan.  The limited authority in Section 1532 and the reduction in funds would not allow TFBSO to continue its mission, particularly in mining and natural resources.  The Administration supports continuing the authorities provided to the TFSBO in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.  Constitutional Concerns:  A number of the bill's provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, including encroachment on the President's exclusive authorities related to international negotiations.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.   * * * * * * *      8  ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 2273, as reported by Committee, which is insufficient to address the risks associated with coal ash disposal and management, and undermines the Federal government\u2019s ability to ensure that requirements for management and disposal of coal combustion residuals are protective of human health and the environment.  The 2008 failure of a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, which spilled more than five million cubic yards of coal ash and will require approximately $1.2 billion for clean-up, is a stark reminder of the need for safe disposal and management of coal ash to protect public health and the environment.  The Administration has assessed structural stability at active coal ash impoundments and has identified 49 units in 12 states as having a \u201chigh hazard potential\u201d rating should they fail.   The Administration supports the development, implementation, and enforcement of appropriate standards for facilities managing coal ash, while encouraging the beneficial use of this economically important material.  Any approach to managing coal ash would need to include:  (1) clear requirements that address the risks associated with the coal ash disposal and management; (2) consideration of the best science and data available; (3) adequate evaluation of structural integrity; (4) protective solutions for existing as well as new facilities; and (5) appropriate public information and comment.  Because H.R. 2273 is deficient in these areas and would replace existing authorities with inadequate and inappropriate minimum requirements, the Administration opposes the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 6079 because it would cost millions of hard-working middle class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve.  It would increase the deficit and detract from the work the Congress needs to do to focus on the economy and create jobs.    Repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean that marketplaces where Americans could compare private insurance plans and get tax credits to purchase them would not open.  Tax credits for small business owners who cover their employees would be eliminated.  States would lose substantial Federal assistance under Medicaid to provide coverage for the neediest Americans.    But repealing the health care law would have implications far beyond the estimated 30 million Americans without insurance who would lose the health coverage they were going to receive.    More than 250 million Americans with insurance \u2013 private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid \u2013 would lose the benefits and protections they receive under the health care law.  Insurance companies would be able to go back to some of their worst practices.  They would no longer have to cover as dependents the 6.6 million young adults who have been able to sign up on their parents' plans.  They would be able to impose lifetime limits and restrictive annual limits on coverage.  They could go back to denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions.  And, they would likely turn away the nearly 70,000 Americans who had gained insurance through Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plans, which would have to shut down.  Insurance companies would no longer be held accountable for double-digit premium increases.  Strict rules that prevent insurance companies from spending too much on administrative costs or CEO bonuses would be erased.  Reforms that strengthen Medicare's long-term finances would also be repealed.  Seniors would lose the more generous prescription drug coverage provided under the health care law, as well as free preventive care.  And Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would become insolvent up to eight years earlier.  Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that repealing the health care law would add more than $100 billion to the deficit over the next decade, and more than $1 trillion in the following decade.  The last thing the Congress should do is refight old political battles and take a massive step backward by repealing basic protections that provide security for the middle class.  Right now, the Congress  needs to work together to focus on the economy and creating jobs.  Congress should act on the President's concrete plans to create an economy built to last by reducing the deficit in a balanced way and investing in education, clean energy, innovation, and infrastructure.  If the President were presented with H.R. 6079, he would veto it.  * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 940, which would repeal tens of billions of dollars in special tax breaks for oil and gas companies over the next decade.  While there is no single solution to addressing the effect of rising gas prices on American families in the short term, the Administration has put forth a long-term plan to cut the Nation\u2019s oil imports by one-third by 2025.  The plan includes increasing domestic production in the short term, while investing in domestic alternative fuels, and increasing efficiency in the vehicles Americans drive.  It is also clear that there are much more responsible ways to utilize the billions in taxpayer dollars provided to oil and gas companies through unwarranted tax breaks.  The Nation\u2019s outdated tax laws currently provide the oil and gas industry billions of dollars per year in these subsidies, even though oil and gas prices are high and the industry is reporting outsized profits.  Furthermore, heads of the major oil and gas companies have in the past made it clear that high oil prices provide more than enough profit motive to invest in domestic exploration and production without special tax breaks.    The Administration believes that, at a time when it is working with the Congress on proposals to reduce Federal deficits, the Nation cannot afford to maintain these wasteful subsidies.  The President proposed eliminating these subsidies in his FY 2010, FY 2011, and FY 2012 Budgets.  The Administration believes these resources are better used for efforts that will help the American people, such as deficit reduction or investments in clean home-grown sources of energy.  The Administration considers this bill to be an important step toward more responsible fiscal and energy policies and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to end these subsidies.  * * * * * * *       ", "The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 674 and an amendment offered by Senator Tester that together will reduce unemployment and ensure that our veterans leave the military with the tools they need to succeed in the civilian workforce.     H.R. 674 would repeal a three percent withholding on certain payments made to private contractors by Federal, State, and local government entities.  The repeal of the withholding requirement in H.R. 674 would reduce a burden on government contractors who otherwise comply with their tax obligations, particularly small businesses.  As evidenced in the President's proposed American Jobs Act, released September 12, 2011, the Administration has supported alleviating this burden, which was originally enacted into law on May 17, 2006.  The Administration also believes it is important to ensure that Federal contractors are compliant with tax laws and supports more targeted efforts that prevent persons with outstanding tax debts from receiving Federal contracts.  The effect of the repeal of the withholding requirement would be to avoid a decrease in cash flow to these contractors, which would allow them to retain these funds and use them to create jobs and pay suppliers.  This would complement the Administration's other efforts to help small businesses.  Repeal of the withholding requirement would also reduce implementation costs borne by Federal and other governmental agencies.  H.R. 674, as amended by Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011, contains the Returning Heroes and Wounded Warrior tax credits for firms that hire unemployed veterans that the President proposed to the Congress as part of the American Jobs Act, as well as other reforms to ensure that the men and women who serve are able to navigate this labor market upon exiting the military.  Having served and defended the Nation, our veterans are well-trained, highly skilled and will add value to any company.   But today's veterans face unique challenges.  As of last month, over 850,000 veterans were unemployed, and the jobless rate for post-9/11 veterans was 12.1 percent.   As we end the war in Iraq and wind down the war in Afghanistan, over one million servicemembers are projected to leave the military between 2011 and 2016.   We have an obligation to ensure that these men and women who have risked their lives to fight for our country do not have to fight for jobs when they return home.   The Vow to Hire Heroes Act provides a new Returning Heroes Tax Credit for firms that hire unemployed veterans.   Firms that hire those veterans who have been unemployed at least 4 weeks will be eligible for a tax credit up to $2,400 per employee, while firms that hire veterans who are long-term unemployed (looking for work for over 6 months) will be eligible for a tax credit up to $5,600.  H.R. 674, as amended, also provides a Wounded Warriors Tax Credit of up to $9,600 that doubles the existing tax credit for firms that hire long-term unemployed veterans with service-connected disabilities.  Together, these tax credits will create a powerful incentive for firms to hire veterans and will help lower the veteran unemployment rate.   As amended by the Vow to Hire Heroes Act, H.R. 674 further provides a number of additional tools to help veterans successfully transition to the civilian workforce.  The Administration has been strongly supportive of improving the Transition Assistance Program.  The amended H.R. 674 builds on these steps and would make TAP mandatory for most servicemembers transitioning to civilian status.     H.R. 674, as amended, also expands career counseling, educational, and training options for unemployed servicemembers, facilitates federal hiring of veterans, and tasks the Department of Labor to develop new tools to help translate military experience to the civilian sector.   All of these reforms are consistent with the Presiden's direction on August 5, 2011, to the Department of Veteran Affairs and the Department of Defense to lead an interagency Task Force to ensure that every member of the service receives the training, education, and credentials they need to transition to the civilian workforce or to pursue higher education.  The Administration already made substantial progress on these proposals.  The amended H.R. 674 will aid the Task Force's work and ensure that our veterans have the support they need to transition to civilian life.  Finally, H.R 674 as amended changes the calculation of modified adjusted gross income, as defined in section 1401 of the Affordable Care Act, to include both taxable and non-taxable Social Security benefits.  Beginning in 2014, this income definition will be used to determine financial eligibility for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and for premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions available through Affordable Insurance Exchanges.    * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3463, which would terminate taxpayer financing of Presidential election campaigns and would eliminate the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) and transfer its responsibilities primarily to the Federal Election Commission.    H.R. 3463 would terminate the Nation's Presidential election public financing system, expanding the power of corporations and special interests in the Nation's elections.  The bill would force many candidates into an endless cycle of fundraising at the expense of engagement with voters on the issues, and would place a premium on access to large donor or special interest support, narrowing the field of otherwise worthy candidates.  In addition, H.R. 3463 would terminate the EAC, which was established after the 2000 Presidential election to improve the administration of elections.  The EAC continues to perform crucial statutory responsibilities by serving as a national clearing house of information for election officials and the public.  In addition, EAC continues to administer Federal grants to the States that support necessary investments in reliable voting and elections equipment, issues and periodically reviews Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, accredits voting system test labs, certifies voting equipment, establishes best practices and guidelines on election administration for State and local election officials, and aids implementation of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and other Federal voting rights statutes.  The EAC has further demonstrated its value with accomplishments such as aiding in the implementation of access programs for disabled voters.  As the only Federal entity charged principally with improving the administration of elections, the EAC helps to protect voters' rights and the integrity of elections and plays an important role as part of the Nation's election system infrastructure.  These functions are too critical to put at risk by allowing them to be subsumed in an entity for which they are not the primary mission.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 861, which would eliminate the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) and rescind $1 billion of funding from the program\u2019s current efforts.  This program allows States and select local governments to stabilize neighborhoods by redeveloping foreclosed and abandoned properties, leading to increased property values and lowered risk of foreclosure for remaining residents.  The Administration is committed to helping struggling American homeowners stay in their homes, and has taken many steps over the last two years to stabilize what was a rapidly-declining housing market.  With many communities still struggling with the impact of the severe decline in the housing market, the Administration believes that continued funding of the NSP grants is important to the Nation\u2019s sustained economic recovery.  If the President is presented with H.R. 861, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration supports House passage of the Rules Committee Print of H.R. 3606.  Helping startups and small businesses succeed and create jobs is fundamental to having an economy built to last.  The President outlined a number of ways to help small businesses grow and become more competitive in his September 8, 2011, address to a Joint Session of Congress on jobs and the economy, as well as in the Startup America Legislative Agenda he sent to the Congress last month.  In both the speech and the agenda, the President called for cutting the red tape that prevents many rapidly growing startup companies from raising needed capital. The President is encouraged to see that there is common ground between his approach and some of the proposals in H.R. 3606.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the House and the Senate to craft legislation that facilitates capital formation and job growth for small businesses and provides appropriate investor protections.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly supports prompt and favorable action by the Congress on the American Jobs Act of 2011, which will create jobs and get the economy moving.  S. 1660 contains all of the jobs measures that were submitted to the Congress by the President last month.  These are the kinds of proposals supported by both Republicans and Democrats.  S. 1660 will put more people back to work and put more money in the pockets of working Americans, and it will do so without adding a dime to the deficit.  First, the American Jobs Act of 2011 provides tax cuts for small businesses and puts more money in the pockets of working and middle class Americans by cutting in half the payroll tax that comes out of the paycheck of every worker.  Second, S. 1660 puts Americans back to work, including teachers, first responders, veterans, and construction workers.  Third, the American Jobs Act of 2011 helps out-of-work Americans by extending unemployment benefits and reforming the system to help people get back to work.  It also supports training and unemployment programs to help the unemployed build key skills and connect to real jobs.  The bill also bans employers from discriminating against the unemployed when hiring and expands job opportunities for low-income youth and adults.    S. 1660 is fully paid for through a surtax on those making over $1 million per year.  The Administration submitted an alternative set of offsets that would have cut back unjustified tax expenditures and loopholes.  However, what is most important is putting Americans back to work right now and making sure  the debt is not increased over time\u2014and doing so in a way that is fair.  S. 1660 meets that test.  Moreover, this surtax could ultimately be replaced by a broader tax reform consistent with the President\u2019s principles of cutting rates, cutting spending through the tax code, cutting the deficit, increasing economic growth, and increasing fairness by ensuring that no household making over $1 million should pay a smaller share of its income in taxes than middle-class families pay.  The American people understand that the economic crisis and the deep recession were not created overnight and will not be solved overnight.  The economic security of the middle class has been under attack for decades.  The Administration believes that the Nation needs not only to recover from this economic crisis, but to rebuild the economy the American way, based on balance, fairness, and the same set of rules for everyone from Wall Street to Main Street.  By enacting S. 1660, the Congress and the President can work together to create the jobs of the future by helping small business entrepreneurs, working and middle-class Americans, and the unemployed Americans searching for work, and by investing in the Nation\u2019s education and infrastructure.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1, making appropriations for the Department of Defense and the other departments and agencies of the Government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, and for other purposes.  The Administration is committed to cutting spending and reducing the deficit so that current government spending does not add to the debt and has put forward a plan to do just that.  However, the Administration does not support deep cuts that will undermine our ability to out-educate, out-build, and out-innovate the rest of the world.  The bill proposes cuts that would sharply undermine core government functions and investments key to economic growth and job creation, and would reduce funding for the Department of Defense to a level that would leave the Department without the resources and flexibility needed to meet vital military requirements.  If the President is presented with a bill that undermines critical priorities or national security through funding levels or restrictions, contains earmarks, or curtails the drivers of long-term economic growth and job creation while continuing to burden future generations with deficits, the President will veto the bill.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to refine the legislation to allow critical government functions to operate without interruption for the remainder of the fiscal year underway.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 830, which would eliminate the Federal Housing Administration\u2019s recently implemented short refinancing program.  This program offers a cost effective approach to assisting underwater borrowers and will lead to sustainable long term homeownership.  The Administration is committed to helping struggling American homeowners stay in their homes, and has taken many steps over the last two years to stabilize what was a rapidly-declining housing market.  As nearly one quarter of American homeowners are currently underwater on their mortgages, the Administration believes that continuation of the FHA refinancing programs is vital to the Nation\u2019s sustained economic recovery.  If the President is presented with H.R. 830, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration values reforms to attract the next generation of highly-skilled immigrants, including legislation to attract and retain foreign students who graduate with advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees; however, the Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 6429.  This legislation, if enacted, would allocate immigrant visas for advanced graduates of a limited set of STEM degree programs, would offer a limited number of visas for families through the \"V\" nonimmigrant visa program, and would eliminate the long-standing Diversity Visa program that makes immigrant visas available to certain individuals from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.     The Administration is deeply committed to building a 21st-century immigration system that meets the Nation's economic and security needs through common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform.  As a part of immigration reform, the Administration strongly supports legislation to attract and retain foreign students who graduate with advanced STEM degrees, to establish a start-up visa for foreign-born entrepreneurs to start businesses and create jobs, and to reform the employment-based immigration system to better meet the needs of the U.S. economy.  However, the Administration does not support narrowly tailored proposals that do not meet the President's long-term objectives with respect to comprehensive immigration reform.  The Administration is encouraged that the Congress appears to be ready to begin serious debate on the need to fix our broken immigration system and looks forward to working with both Democrats and Republicans to enact a common-sense approach that includes reforms to the legal immigration system.  Such an approach must provide for attracting and retaining highly skilled immigrants and uniting Americans with their family members more quickly, as well as other important priorities such as establishing a pathway for undocumented individuals to earn their citizenship, holding employers accountable for breaking the law, and continuing efforts to strengthen the Nation's robust enforcement system.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration urges the Senate to ensure that United States has the resources necessary to help the Nation thrive and compete in the future.  A strong energy sector requires investment in innovation and clean energy technologies, access to clean water and outdoor recreational opportunities, and support for job creating measures like renewable energy projects and technologies.  Department of Energy (DOE)  Clean Energy Research and Development (R&D).  The Administration strongly urges the Senate to provide $1.95 billion for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs and at least $300 million for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, both of which are critical to implementing the Administration's goals of transforming the Nation's economy to support clean energy jobs and improving U.S. energy security.  These investments will help improve U.S. competitiveness in advanced manufacturing and in emerging technologies such as electric vehicles and batteries, biofuels, energy efficient systems for buildings, solar energy, and offshore wind power.  Innovation and R&D.  The Administration strongly urges the Senate to provide $4.95 billion for the Office of Science to maintain its critical investment in America's innovation future.  Inadequate funding places fundamental research at risk in areas of science that underpin clean energy technologies and can spur innovation.  Inadequate funding levels will not allow optimum utilization of DOE research assets, hampering the development of the next generation of technologies and manufacturing for use in the automobile, semiconductor, pharmaceutical, and numerous other industries.  Energy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration appreciates Senate support and  urges the Senate to provide at least $105 million so that EIA can continue to provide independent and rigorous analysis of America's energy needs.  Loan Guarantee Program.  The Administration appreciates that the Senate bill supports the loan guarantee program.  The Senate level of $200 million would support an estimated $1 billion to $2 billion in loan guarantees for innovative renewable energy and energy efficiency projects.  The Administration urges the Senate to include funds for a new Better Building Pilot Loan Guarantee Program proposed in the President's FY 2012 Budget and additional loan volume authority for nuclear power projects.  These programs are an important part of the Nation's efforts to deploy innovative clean energy technologies.  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)  Weapons Activities and Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation.  The Administration urges the Senate to support robust funding for NNSA to continue the commitment to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and upgrade the stockpile set forth in the Nuclear Posture Review and reaffirmed as part of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ratification process.  In addition, at a time when a grave danger is posed by the proliferation of nuclear materials that can fall into the hands of terrorist organizations, the Administration appreciates Senate support for highly enriched uranium (HEU) reactor conversions and increased security for HEU and plutonium as high-priority elements of the global effort to lock down nuclear materials.  Corps of Engineers (Corps)  Corps Funding.  The Administration is concerned with the Senate funding level for the Corps, which is $233 million above the President's FY 2012 Budget.  The additional funding could be redirected toward higher-priority needs and programs that have a greater potential for results in a time of scarce resources.  In addition, the Administration is concerned that in the allocation of funds, the bill would preclude funding for the limited number of priority new starts in the President's FY 2012 Budget, including an important new program to reverse damage to the coastal Louisiana ecosystem and a study called for by the Congress to examine flood risks nationwide in order to improve existing programs.  Disaster Relief Funding.  Consistent with past practice, the Administration supports providing additional funding to repair Federal flood control and other infrastructure damaged by natural disasters.  The Administration will work with the Congress as the Corps verifies the funding level that is necessary to accomplish this work and that is appropriately designated for a disaster relief cap adjustment under section 251 of the Budget Control Act.  Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation  Overall Bureau of Reclamation Funding.  The Administration believes the $20 million in funding above the President's FY 2012 Budget is unnecessary.  These funds could be redirected toward higher priority needs and programs that have a greater potential for results in a time of scarce resources.  Division 2 \u2013 Financial Services and General Government  The Administration urges the Senate to provide the resources necessary to fund core Government functions as well as implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 2  Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  Through reforms to cut waste, reduce errors, and boost quality, the ACA will reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars, while ensuring that quality, affordable coverage is available for all Americans.  The Dodd-Frank Act contains essential measures to crack down on abuses in the mortgage industry, make financial contracts simpler, end hidden fees, and provide clear and concise information to borrowers about the obligations they are undertaking.  Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\u2013Tax Enforcement.  The Administration strongly supports increased funding for IRS tax enforcement, compliance, and service activities above the Senate bill level.  The reductions in the Senate bill will lead to the loss of at least $3.5 billion in Federal revenue, as well as reductions of approximately 4,000 in staff.  The Administration strongly encourages the Senate to adopt the Administration's proposed IRS program integrity allocation adjustment in the bill or find another means to support increased IRS funding.  Tax enforcement and compliance activities typically return $7 or more on each taxpayer dollar spent.  IRS\u2013Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The Administration strongly supports full funding for the IRS to meet its ACA implementation responsibilities, including standing up critical systems to support Affordable Insurance Exchanges.  Departmental Operations.  The Administration supports the Senate funding level of $306 million for Departmental Offices (DO), including its retention of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence program funding within the DO account.  The overall DO funding level supports the Department of the Treasury's ability to implement priority programs, including tax and regulatory reform.  Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The Administration appreciates the $200 million for CDFI, including the support for Administration initiatives, such as the Healthy Food Financing Initiative that will increase the availability of affordable, healthy food outlets in underserved urban and rural communities that lack adequate access to healthy food.  Office of Personnel and Management (OPM)  New Statutory Responsibilities.  The funding level provided by the bill would limit OPM's ability to implement and administer new statutory responsibilities.  Executive Office of the President  Partnership Fund for Program Integrity Innovation.  The Administration urges the Senate to sustain the Partnership Fund for Program Integrity Innovation by extending the period of availability for the existing program funds.  This extension would enable continued collaboration with States and other stakeholders to launch additional pilots designed to find promising ways to save taxpayer funds across Government programs by cutting improper payments and streamlining program administration.  Integrated, Efficient, and Effective Uses of Information Technology (IEEUIT).  The Administration urges the Senate to provide additional funding for this initiative.  IEEUIT will increase the potential for future savings achievable through broader support to agency plans for cloud computing and data center consolidation, and a more rigorous IT investment oversight 3  process.  General Services Administration  Federal Buildings Fund (FBF).  The Administration commends the Senate for fully funding FBF operating costs \u2013 including rental of space, buildings operations, and installment acquisition.  While the Administration appreciates Senate funding of $65 million for capital investment, the Administration is concerned that the bill would, for the second year in a row, provide insufficient resources to address needed repairs and alterations, and urges the Senate to include additional funding for these purposes.  Integrated Acquisition Environment.  The Administration urges the Senate to provide funding for the Integrated Acquisition Environment, which would increase procurement data quality and system functionality while reducing costs and burden for both the Federal Government and businesses working with or seeking to work with the Federal Government.  Electronic Government.  The Administration recommends that the Senate not combine the E-Government and the Federal Citizen Services Fund and that the Senate provide adequate funding to continue with initiatives that enhance transparency and oversight into Government spending, and yield a high return on investment through cost saving efficiencies.  The E-Government Fund has yielded billions in cost savings and cost avoidance over the last two years.  Combining the E-Government and Federal Citizen Services funds would introduce a level of uncertainty around how the funds would be allocated given the differing mandates of the funds.  Furthermore, a new fund would not be subject to the Electronic Government Act of 2002.  Other Independent Agencies  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Administration strongly supports funding for the SEC at the Senate bill level of $1.4 billion, which will enable the SEC to carry out without delay its increased responsibilities for registration, oversight, and enforcement within the securities marketplace.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The Administration strongly supports the Senate level of $240 million for CFTC.  This funding level will better enable CFTC to provide the necessary oversight of the futures and swaps marketplace in a timely and effective manner.  Moreover, the Administration strongly supports the Senate bill's provision of $66 million for major IT system investments, which are essential to CFTC's oversight and clearing responsibilities as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The Administration supports the Senate funding level and terms provided to the FCC, which would be fully paid for through fee collections and will allow the FCC to protect an open Internet and fulfill its other missions.  The Administration supports a free and open Internet that fosters investment, innovation, consumer choice and free speech, and is committed to ensuring that the Internet continues as an open platform for productivity, growth, and innovation.  Small Business Administration (SBA).  The Administration urges the Senate to provide funding for SBA's Emerging Leaders Program and Entrepreneurial Development Initiative to support well-targeted business-led economic growth and job creation.  4  Election Assistance Commission (EAC).  The Administration supports funding EAC at the requested level of $14 million to maintain the Commission's ability to fulfill its statutorily required duties and protect the integrity of elections.  Bill-Wide Provisions  Cuba.  The Administration opposes, as written, section 624 in the Senate Committee bill, but supports its intent to reduce financial fees that may currently be assessed on transactions related to U.S. exports of goods pursuant to the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000.  The Administration would not oppose section 624 if certain technical corrections are made.  Transfers for E-Government Initiatives.  The Administration supports amending section 732 of the Senate bill to allow inter-agency transfers of funds for E-Government initiatives 15 days after notification of House and Senate Appropriations Committees for continuing initiatives (30 days after notification for new E-Government initiatives), without the requirement for prior approval of the appropriations committees.  The business process for E-Government initiatives would be facilitated by allowing individual appropriations bills to address this issue where it may be a concern, without imposing conditions for prior approval across all Executive Branch agencies.  Contracting Closely Associated Government Functions.  The Administration opposes section 741 of the Senate bill, which would require civilian agencies to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that contracts do not include functions that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions.  Agencies should not be expected to stop using contractors to perform these functions, as long as the agency is giving adequate management attention to ensure contractors are not impinging on the agency's inherently governmental responsibilities.  The proposed requirement to collect \"cost data\" should also be stricken as it would be unnecessarily burdensome on contractors without commensurate benefit.  Division 3 \u2013 State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  The Senate bill for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs supports vital, bipartisan efforts aimed at the root causes of instability and insecurity in fragile and failing countries around the world.  It protects key priorities while making difficult choices, such as adopting proposals in the President's FY 2012 Budget to reduce assistance to countries in Europe and Central Asia with lesser need.  By contrast, the Administration would strongly oppose measures that undermine needed funding for civilian engagement in support of critical U.S. interests around the world.   Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Administration appreciates the support for OCO funding in the Senate bill, which is essential to achieving the Administration's foreign policy and national security priorities in the frontline states.  While funding for these programs is increasing at the Department of State, the increases are more than offset by over $40 billion in decreases to Department of Defense OCO, as operations transition from military to civilian leadership.  The Senate is urged to adequately fund both base and OCO funding for the missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.  Iraq.  While the Administration appreciates congressional support for assistance and operations in Iraq, the Administration is concerned about the reductions to the request for Department of 5  State operations and assistance programs in the Senate bill.  The Administration's request for economic and security assistance is necessary to sustain the Administration's transition plans, and reductions will slow needed capacity-building programs for Iraqi Ministries, particularly for training programs for the Iraq police.  The Administration is also concerned about the $570 million combined OCO and base reduction (minus 15 percent) for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in the Senate bill.  A reduction of this magnitude would eliminate the flexibility necessary during a key transition period for the U.S. presence in Iraq.  Global Health, Food Security, and Global Climate Change Initiatives.  The Administration commends the Senate bill's essential provisions for global health, food security, and climate change.  Economic Support Fund (ESF).  The Administration is concerned that the $388 million provided by the Senate could result in dramatic reductions to country assistance levels.  In addition, the Administration opposes the Senate rescission of $150 million of unexpended balances.  Following the $120 million rescission in FY 2011, an additional rescission could require deobligating funds committed to countries and programs, harming the Government's objectives in and relations with those countries.  In particular, at a time when ESF funds are central to the U.S. response to the Arab Awakening, these cuts and rescissions will impact State and United States Agency for International Development's ability to respond to rapid developments in the Middle East.  Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) Fund.  The Administration opposes the Senate bill's elimination of a separate appropriation to support the ERMA Fund.  The Fund provides the President with a flexible tool to meet unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs on such terms and conditions as the President may determine.  Action by the President to utilize ERMA funds can leverage other donations on behalf of humanitarian emergencies by providing a separate funding mechanism used only to respond to emergent crises.  Treasury Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs).  The Administration appreciates the Senate Committee bill's $2.1 billion for MDBs, fully funding three of four General Capital Increase (GCI) installments and U.S. commitments to multilateral debt relief, while meeting a sizable portion of replenishment commitments to the concessional windows.  The Administration also appreciates the Senate bill's inclusion of needed authorization language for all requested GCIs and replenishments. However, the Administration is concerned about funding shortfalls for the African Development Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank and would like to work with the Committees to find a solution.   Language Provisions.  The Administration appreciates that the Senate bill includes appropriations language that is needed to carry out key foreign policy objectives.  This includes authority to support the Arab Awakening, which would authorize Egyptian debt swaps, Tunisian loan guarantees, and new enterprise funds.  The Senate bill also authorizes critically needed general capital increases for three multilateral development banks and lifting the cap on U.S. contributions to United Nations peacekeeping, consistent with the contribution level in prior years.  Further, the Senate bill includes language relating to State Department management that would allow a new maintenance cost sharing program to address the Department's large overseas maintenance backlog and continue collection of fees under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.  All of these provisions need to be included in a final bill.  However, the Administration opposes several significant changes in the bill's certification and 6  reporting requirements and requests a more workable solution to these requirements.  The Administration will also work with the Congress to explore opportunities where increased transfer authority will provide flexibility to manage this constrained resource level.  Constitutional Concerns  Numerous provisions of the Senate bill, including sections 7013, 7029, 7032, 7035, 7039, 7047, 7048, 7061, 7062, 7065, 7069, 7070, and 7073, could infringe upon the President's constitutional authority over foreign affairs by interfering with his conduct of foreign diplomacy and interactions with foreign diplomats.  In addition, section 7046(a) of the Senate bill would infringe upon the President's authority as Commander in Chief and over the conduct of foreign diplomacy by restricting his ability to place U.S. forces under the command of a foreign national in certain circumstances.  The Administration urges that these provisions be made advisory rather than mandatory.  Section 7093(c)(3) of the Senate bill also raises constitutional concerns by potentially requiring the disclosure to the Congress of diplomatic communications and other sensitive information relating to national security and foreign affairs.  If any of the provisions discussed above are enacted in their present form, the Administration will apply them in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authorities.  * * * * * * *    7  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2237 to give small businesses a tax break for increasing wages, creating new jobs, and making new investments.  By providing targeted tax relief to the businesses that are expanding their workforce and making new investments in capital, S. 2237 will help spur economic growth and job creation and strengthen the recovery.  Targeted tax relief for small businesses is one of the five to-do items the President has called on the Congress to pass as part of a concrete plan that creates jobs and helps restore middle class security.  Under S. 2237, nearly two million companies that make new hires or increase wages would receive a 10 percent income tax credit on their new payroll, encouraging over $200 billion in new hiring and pay raises.  Because the credit is limited to $5 million in new wages (for a credit of up to $500,000 per firm), S. 2237 is particularly beneficial to small businesses.  S. 2237 is also focused on middle class workers.  Because the credit is based on the Social Security wage base, companies would receive no credit for increasing wages above $110,100.  The Congressional Budget Office recently found this type of targeted tax relief to be the single most effective business tax option for boosting hiring and spurring economic growth.   S. 2237 would also put an additional $50 billion in the hands of businesses over this year and the next by extending the 100 percent expensing provision that the President signed into law in December 2010, which rewards firms for making new investments by allowing them to immediately deduct the full value of those investments in calculating their taxable earnings.  S. 2237 provides a direct incentive for companies to hire workers and make the sorts of investments that will boost economic growth.  In addition, this legislation ensures that companies that are actively cutting their workforce or that offer raises only to already well-paid executives would be ineligible for the tax relief.    The President believes that entrepreneurs and small businesses are engines of innovation and economic growth and are currently at the forefront of the Nation's economic recovery.  The proposals in S. 2237 build on the 18 small business tax cuts that the President has already signed into law, ranging from the small business health tax credit to the temporary tax exclusion of capital gains from key small business investments.  Congress should act now to help American small businesses hire and grow with targeted tax relief designed to boost jobs, rather than enacting additional costly tax cuts for the most fortunate.     * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 30, the Save American Workers Act, because it would significantly increase the deficit, reduce the number of Americans with employer-based health insurance coverage, and create incentives for employers to shift their employees to part-time work \u2013 causing the problem it intends to solve.  Rather than attempting once again to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act, which the House has tried to do over 50 times, it is time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in forwarding an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to be a part of the middle class. This legislation would weaken a provision of the Affordable Care Act designed to maintain employer-based health insurance coverage, protect their employees, and prevent employers\u2019 health-benefit costs from being shifted to taxpayers.  According to the July estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, it would increase the budget deficit by $45.7 billion over the 2015 to 2024 period, reduce the number of people receiving employer-based health insurance coverage, and increase the number of individuals who are uninsured.  While the Administration appreciates the concerns that result from the current 30-hour definition of full-time work, there is no evidence that this has caused a broad shift to part-time work to date. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, since the Affordable Care Act became law, more than 90 percent of the increase in employment has been in full-time jobs, and over that time, the economy has added 10.8 million private-sector jobs.  Furthermore, by moving the threshold to 40 hours, this legislation could cause the problem it claims to solve by greatly increasing the number of workers for whom employers may have an incentive to reduce hours to avoid the requirement. The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care.  Since 2013, estimates show that about 10 million Americans have gained health coverage.  Nearly 6.5 million have renewed or newly signed up for health insurance coverage through the Federally-facilitated Health Insurance Marketplaces to date, and open enrollment continues through February 15.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to a pre-existing medical condition now have access to coverage.  Additionally, the law allows millions of young Americans to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26, and provides access to free preventive care like cancer screenings that can catch illness early on.  Equally important, the Affordable Care Act has contributed to the slowest growth in the prices of health care goods and services in 50 years. While the Administration welcomes ideas to improve the law, H.R. 30 would shift costs to taxpayers, put workers\u2019 hours at risk, and disrupt health insurance coverage.

The Administration, however, strongly opposes H.R. 161, which would allow the automatic approval of natural gas pipeline projects if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or other Federal agencies do not issue the required permit, license, or approval within rigid, unworkable timeframes. H.R. 161 could create conflicts with existing statutory and regulatory requirements and practices related to agencies' programs, and preclude opportunities for engaging the public and potentially impacted communities, thereby causing confusion and the risk of increased litigation.  The bill's requirements could force agencies to make decisions based on incomplete information or information that may not be available, including potential environmental and community impacts of the proposed pipelines, within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time.  For these reasons, the bill may actually delay projects or lead to more project denials, undermining the intent of the legislation. FERC has reported that, since Fiscal Year 2009, it has completed action on 91 percent (512 out of 563) of all pipeline applications that it has received within one year of receipt.  The small percent of decisions that have taken longer than one year involve complex proposals that merit additional review and consideration.  Further, FERC already has an existing framework to set reasonable timetables for the other Federal agencies with permit, review, or approval authority to act.

The Administration also looks forward to working with the Congress to improve or clarify certainother aspects of the bill, such as the time-limited approval process for grants.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact its fully-paid-for GROW AMERICA proposal, which provides $478 billion over six years for highways, transit, highway safety, and rail programs.  By incorporating rail into the surface transportation multi-year funding framework, the GROW AMERICA proposal provides the funding and certainty needed to improve passenger rail service at the national, regional, and State levels, enable local communities to implement critical grade crossing safety measures, and help commuter railroads enhance safety by installing positive train control systems.  The Administration urges the Congress to move quickly to enact a long-term surface transportation bill that lays the foundation for long-term economic growth.     * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration is committed to addressing the opioid epidemic through enhanced prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts.  New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that opioids\u2014a class of drugs that includes prescription pain medications and heroin\u2014were involved in 28,648 deaths in 2014.  Prescription pain medication deaths remain far too high, and 2014 marked a sharp increase in heroin-involved deaths and an increase in deaths involving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.  In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for prescription opioids, which is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of pills.  Four in five new heroin users started out by misusing prescription drugs.  Policies aimed at preventing, responding to, and treating opioid use disorders are essential to turning the tide on this epidemic.  S. 524 includes important objectives such as: increasing education and awareness about the misuse of prescription opioids; expanding the availability of medication-assisted treatment, including in criminal justice settings; supporting treatment as an alternative to incarceration; training and equipping first responders on the use of the opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone; supporting emergency services in rural areas; and providing recovery support services.  However, while S. 524 identifies several steps needed to respond to the opioid epidemic, the Administration is concerned that the bill does not include the funding necessary to implement these steps\u2014and until that funding is provided by the Congress, these steps would do little to address the epidemic.  Moreover, rather than accelerate important policies like training health care providers about appropriate opioid prescribing, the bill includes an unnecessary feasibility study on the issue that would delay action.    The President's Fiscal Year 2017 Budget includes $1 billion in new mandatory funding to expand access to treatment and recovery services for opioid use disorders, support the placement of substance use disorder treatment providers in the communities most in need of behavioral health providers, and continue to build the evidence base for effective treatment programs.  This funding will boost efforts to help individuals with an opioid use disorder to seek treatment, successfully complete treatment, and sustain recovery.  The Budget also includes more than $90 million in additional  discretionary funding that builds on current efforts across the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to expand state-level prescription drug overdose prevention strategies, expand access to medication assisted treatment, improve access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, and support targeted enforcement activities.      The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on securing funding to provide families and communities with the support they need for opioid abuse prevention and to ensure that treatment is available for those who seek it.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1732, which would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army (Army) to withdraw and re-propose specified draft regulations needed to clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The agencies' rulemaking, grounded in science, is essential to ensure clean water for future generations, and is responsive to calls for rulemaking from Congress, industry, and community stakeholders as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The proposed rule has been through an extensive public engagement process.  Clean water is vital for the success of the Nation's businesses, agriculture, energy development, and the health of our communities.  More than one in three Americans get their drinking water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that are at risk of pollution from upstream sources.  The protection of wetlands is vital for hunting and fishing.  When Congress passed the CWA in 1972, to restore the Nation's waters, it recognized that to have healthy communities downstream, we need to protect the smaller streams and wetlands upstream.   Clarifying the scope of the CWA helps to protect clean water, safeguard public health, and strengthen the economy.  Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 focused on specific jurisdictional determinations and rejected the analytical approach that the Army Corps of Engineers was using for those determinations, but did not invalidate the underlying regulation.  This has created ongoing questions and uncertainty about how the regulation is applied consistent with the Court's decisions.  The proposed rule would address this uncertainty. If enacted, H.R. 1732 would derail current efforts to clarify the scope of the CWA, hamstring future regulatory efforts, and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water.  H.R. 1732 also would delay by a number of years any action to clarify the scope of the CWA, because it would:  (1) require the agencies to re-propose a rule that has already gone through an extensive public comment process; and (2) create a burdensome advisory process that would complicate the agencies' rulemaking and potentially constrain their discretion.  The agencies have already conducted an extensive and lengthy outreach to a broad range of stakeholders who will continue to be engaged in the current process. Duplicative outreach and consultation would impose unnecessary burdens and excessive costs on all parties.     The final rule should be allowed to proceed.  EPA and Army have sought the views of and listened carefully to the public throughout the extensive public engagement process for this rule.  It would be imprudent to dismiss the years of work that have already occurred and no value would be added.  The agencies need to be able to finish their work. In the end, H.R. 1732, like its predecessors, would sow more confusion and invite more conflict  at a time when our communities and businesses need clarity and certainty around clean water regulation.  Simply put, this bill is not an act of good government; rather, it would hinder the ongoing rulemaking process and the agencies' ability to respond to the public as well as two Supreme Court rulings. If the President were presented with H.R. 1732, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration welcomes the bill's investments in military infrastructure, housing, services for men and women in our armed forces and their families, rental assistance for low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled, as well as its investments in programs that reduce lead-based paint hazards for low-income families with children.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee's commitment to fund the benefits and services our veterans have earned, help reduce the claims backlog, support medical and prosthetic research, and provide the requested advanced appropriations.  In addition, the Administration appreciates the bill's support of surface transportation priorities, including TIGER grants, Transit New Starts and Amtrak and passenger rail service.  Furthermore, the Administration welcomes the bill's support of the Federal Aviation Administration, including the Next Generation Air Transportation System initiative, as well as key functions in the Office of the Secretary initiated in the FAST ACT.     However, the Administration is concerned that the bill underfunds critical investments in ending homelessness and revitalizing distressed communities, leaving over 40,000 chronically homeless individuals and homeless families with children unserved, and failing to address the widening opportunity gap confronting the Nation's poorest neighborhoods.  Additionally, the bill does not support the President's full vision for a 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan that expands transportation options for American families, while reducing carbon emissions, cutting oil consumption, and creating new jobs.  Further, the Administration is concerned that the bill includes provisions that would undermine the safety of the Nation's highway system and includes unwarranted restrictions on the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, as these restrictions further impede the Executive Branch's efforts to responsibly close the facility.  In October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.   However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the final bill that is presented to the President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.    The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Division A \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  Department of Transportation (DOT)  21st Century Clean Transportation Plan.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not support the President's vision for a 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan that expands transportation options for American families while reducing carbon emissions, cutting oil consumption, and creating new jobs.  The Administration urges the Congress to consider strategic opportunities to enhance revenue and investments to support a new, clean, sustainable transportation system and increase the competitiveness and productivity of the economy.  Federal Transit Administration (FTA) New Starts Capital Investment.  The Administration appreciates the support provided in the bill for this program but is disappointed that the bill does not provide the $3.5 billion requested as part of the Clean Transportation Plan.  Such funding would increase the capacity of the Nation's transit network and help meet ridership demands in many communities.  Amtrak and Passenger Rail.  The Administration appreciates funding provided in the bill for Amtrak, rail safety and improvement programs but urges the Congress to support the FY 2017 Budget request of over $2 billion to support and improve our Nation's passenger rail service.  Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support for the TIGER program but is disappointed that the bill does not provide the full FY 2017 Budget request of $1.25 billion to fund infrastructure projects of national and regional significance.  Demand for TIGER has been overwhelming, with over $134 billion requested in more than 6,700 applications to date.  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided for FAA, but is concerned with provisions that undermine FAA's ability to optimize certain services.  The bill also misses an opportunity to improve airport infrastructure by focusing Federal grants to support smaller commercial and general aviation airports that do not have access to additional revenue while increasing the Passenger Facility Charge for all commercial airports.  Highway Safety.  The Administration is concerned about provisions in the bill that have the potential to undercut public safety, including section 131 of the bill regarding DOT's \"Hours of Service\" regulation addressing driver fatigue.  Other Reforms.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for other reforms including providing $3 million in funding for the National Surface Transportation and Innovative 2  Finance Bureau and $3 million for the new Interagency Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Center.  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOT to implement the Data Act.  This funding supports the Department's efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOT to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Tenant-Based Rental Assistance.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to fund the Housing Choice Voucher Program at the requested level of $20.9 billion.  While the funding level is sufficient to provide nearly the same level of assistance to families as in FY 2016, the bill does not fund the requested 10,000 new targeted vouchers necessary to make progress to end homelessness among families by 2020 or the requested $2.1 billion for Administrative Fees to improve mobility and ensure that assisted units are safe and habitable.  However, the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Mobility Counseling Program, which would help low-income families access safer neighborhoods, better schools, and areas with more job opportunities.  Homeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides only  $2.3 billion in funding for the Homeless Assistance Grants program, which is $334 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  Although the bill provides $40 million for youth homelessness, which is $15 million above the FY 2017 Budget request, the bill does not provide the requested funds to support the Administration's efforts to end chronic homelessness among individuals or families with children.  Choice Neighborhoods.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Choice Neighborhoods program, a key part of the President's Promise Zones initiative to accelerate economic mobility and revitalization in high-poverty communities.  The Administration objects to the $80 million provided, which is $120 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  This would fund only 2-3 implementation grants in 2017, leaving dozens of distressed communities untouched.  The Administration also opposes the requirement that implementation grants be awarded only to prior planning grantees, which would penalize communities that have invested their own funds in large-scale planning efforts and may be strong candidates for an implementation grant.  Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Administrative Fee.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the proposed new FHA fee and provide the FY 2017 Budget request of $160 million for FHA administrative expenses.  The request level would lower taxpayer risks and improve access to mortgage credit for underserved borrowers by enabling FHA to both strengthen and clarify its lender oversight and compliance policies.    3  ConnectHome Initiative.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the FY 2017 Budget request of $5 million for the ConnectHome initiative.  The requested funding level would narrow the digital divide by facilitating high-speed internet access and providing digital literacy services to students and families in public housing, a population that faces numerous barriers in accessing the resources and skills needed to succeed in the 21st Century.  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for HUD to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding would support the Department's efforts to manage and improve the agency's digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.  Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions in the bill, including sections 188, 223, 405, and 406, raise separation of powers concerns.  Division B \u2013 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies  Department of Defense (DOD)  Military Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for DOD's military construction and family housing requirements.  The projects requested in the FY 2017 Budget reflect the highest priority projects for DOD.   Detainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to section 409 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This provision would constrain the flexibility that the Executive Branch needs to be able to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  VA Funding.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for our Nation's veterans and commends the Committee for including general transfer authority language.  This funding would ensure continued benefits and services that our veterans deserve, though the $154 million reduction from the FY 2017 Budget request could delay needed repairs to hospitals and clinics.  Whistleblower Complaints.  The Administration objects to section 246 of the bill, which contains unnecessary and unworkable language regarding whistleblowers.  VA has in place long-standing authorities, remedies, and programs specifically created to address claims of improper retaliation in the workplace, and the Senate is urged to eliminate this section from the bill.  In addition, section 246 could raise constitutional concerns in certain applications.  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for VA to implement the DATA Act.  This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.  4  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for VA to continue support of a digital service team.  This funding would support efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on veterans, citizens and businesses.  Constitutional Concerns  Other provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 113 and 127 of the bill may interfere with the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  5  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3791, a bill that seeks to raise the consolidated assets threshold under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $5 billion.  The primary purpose of the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Policy Statement) is to make it easier for small banks to raise capital so they can continue to provide services to their local communities.  The Policy Statement also ensures that when small, community institutions are purchased, they are more likely to be purchased by another community institution rather than a larger bank.  Less than one year ago, the Congress reached a compromise to raise the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement threshold from $500 million to $1 billion.  That change was intended to ensure that local communities retain access to the banks that best understand their needs and can provide personalized services to residents.  Now, less than one year later, this piece of legislation seeks to raise that threshold again \u2013 to $5 billion \u2013 in an attempt to allow large banks to evade specific minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements.  These limitations were put in place to ensure that banks remain sound and able to serve their customers.  Community banks with $1 to $5 billion in assets already have sufficient access to capital markets and as a group are exhibiting health and resilience.  Raising the threshold to exempt banks with over $1 billion from important minimum leverage and capital requirements would do little more than encourage banks to take on debt, endangering their soundness and potentially depriving their customers of much needed banking services should the bank fail.  Setting the consolidated assets threshold at $1 billion was a bipartisan decision that struck a balance between allowing small banks to access capital to better serve their customers, and ensuring their safety and soundness.  Raising the threshold to $5 billion less than a year later would be an unnecessary and risky change.

In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pollution threatens Americans' health and welfare by leading to long-lasting climate changes that are already having a range of negative effects on human health and the environment.  Power plants account for roughly one-third of all domestic GHG emissions.  While the United States limits emissions of arsenic, mercury, and lead pollution from power plants, there are no national limits on power plant carbon pollution. As part of his Climate Action Plan, the President directed EPA to work with States, utilities, and other stakeholders to develop the first ever national standards to address carbon pollution from power plants.  In June 2014, EPA proposed to do just that by issuing the Clean Power Plan proposal for public comment.    The bill would give governors unprecedented and broad discretion to avoid compliance with the CAA, thereby delaying the delivery of important public health benefits.  The bill\u2019s effects would be felt hardest by those most at risk from the impacts of air pollution and climate change, such as the elderly, the infirm, children, native and tribal groups, and low-income populations.     In addition, the bill is premature and unnecessary.  It is premature because the Clean Power Plan has not yet been finalized; it is unnecessary because EPA has made clear its commitment to address concerns raised during the public comment period (including concerns related to cost and reliability) when issuing the final Clean Power Plan this summer and working with the States on the development of the State Plans.  The effect of the bill would therefore be a wholly unnecessary postponement of reductions of harmful air pollution.   The bill also is unprecedented. The Administration is not aware of any instance when Congress has enacted legislation to stay implementation of a CAA standard during judicial review.  To do so here, before the rule is even final, would be an unprecedented interference with EPA's efforts to fulfill its duties under the CAA.  Since the CAA was enacted with bipartisan support in 1970, (and amended in 1977 and in 1990), the economy has more than tripled in size while emissions of key pollutants have decreased by  nearly 70 percent.  More than forty years of clean air regulation has shown that a strong economy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.   Because H.R. 2042 threatens the health and economic welfare of current and future generations by blocking important standards to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector, if the President were presented with H.R. 2042, he would veto the bill.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2666, the No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act, which would undermine key provisions in the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Open Internet order and harm the Commission's ability to protect consumers while facilitating innovation and economic growth.  For almost a century, our laws have recognized that companies that connect Americans to the world have special obligations not to exploit the gatekeeper power they enjoy over access in and out of our homes and businesses.  The same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information, whether a phone call or a packet of data.  The FCC's rules \u2014 issued after a lengthy rulemaking process that garnered an unprecedented amount of public input, including comments from four million Americans \u2014 recognize that broadband service is of the same importance, and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do.  These carefully-designed rules have already been implemented in large part with little or no adverse impact on the telecommunications companies making important investments in our economy.  H.R. 2666 is overly broad and extends far beyond codifying the FCC's forbearance from applying provisions of the Communications Act related to tariffs, rate approval, or other forms of utility regulation.  Even as amended, H.R. 2666 would restrict the FCC's ability to take enforcement actions to protect consumers on issues where the FCC has received numerous consumer complaints.  The bill also would hamstring the FCC's public interest authority to review transactions.  H.R. 2666 also could limit the Commission's ability to address new practices and adapt its rules for a dynamic, fast-changing online marketplace.

The SAB, along with other functions, reviews the quality and adequacy of certain scientific and technical information used by EPA or proposed as the basis for EPA regulations.  Therefore, it is imperative that the SAB be composed of the most knowledgeable scientific and technical experts available.  The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which governs Federal advisory committees such as the SAB, provides for balanced panels and subcommittees that include experts with diverse backgrounds who represent wide-ranging perspectives.   H.R. 1029 would negatively affect the appointment of experts and would weaken the scientific independence and integrity of the SAB.  For example, the bill would impose a hiring quota for SAB members based on employment by a State, local, or tribal government as opposed to scientific expertise.  The bill would also place limitations on SAB members' participation in \"advisory activities that directly or indirectly involve review and evaluation of their own work.\"  Determining the practical meaning of \"indirect\" involvement will be difficult and consequently problematic to implement.  The provisions on appointment of experts to the SAB and various other requirements could also preclude the nomination of scientists with significant expertise in their fields.    In addition, H.R. 1029 would add burdensome requirements on the SAB with respect to solicitation of and response to public comments, above and beyond those imposed by FACA.  These new requirements would saddle the SAB with workload that would impair its ability to carry out its mandate.  Further, H.R. 1029 would add an unnecessary, burdensome, and costly layer of requirements for hazard and risk assessments without defining the scope of these requirements and absent recognition that many high profile assessments already are reviewed by the SAB.

By further constraining IRS resources, H.R. 4885 would have detrimental effects on the IRS's ability to provide quality service to taxpayers, administer the tax code, and enforce tax laws.   H.R. 4885 would repeal the IRS's longstanding legal authority to offset the cost of providing services to taxpayers with user fees.  The IRS has had this authority since 1995, and charges user fees for a variety of services.  Repealing this authority would reduce overall IRS resources by roughly 4 percent, compounding budget cuts that have left the IRS severely underfunded and reversing the limited progress the IRS has been able to make on taxpayer service levels this year after receiving a modest funding increase in fiscal year 2016.  Even with this small increase, the IRS budget remains more than $900 million lower than it was in fiscal year 2010, before adjusting for inflation.  These cuts cost the Nation billions of dollars each year in lost tax revenue and have been enacted despite the IRS's crucial and growing responsibilities to implement new mandates and enhance cybersecurity protections.   The IRS needs more resources, not fewer, to deter tax cheats, serve honest taxpayers, and protect taxpayer data.  That is why the President's FY 2017 Budget would increase IRS funding by $530 million above the FY 2016 enacted level to protect the integrity of the tax system, fairly enforce the tax code, and provide adequate levels of taxpayer services.  Unfortunately, H.R. 4885 would go in the opposite direction, further reducing the resources available to the IRS and undermining the fairness and integrity of the tax system in ways that would increase burdens on taxpayers, including by increasing the deficit.

H.R. 2130 would set aside existing Federal surveys of land along the Red River in Texas and would require the Secretary to commission and to accept, without Federal participation, surveys of the land approved by the Texas General Land Office. This legislation would require the Secretary to delegate her authority for determining Federal estate to a state agency, would be counter to nearly 100 years of settled law, and could reduce mineral revenue opportunities for the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Tribes and the State of Oklahoma.

The retrospective review of regulations has been an ongoing priority of this Administration.  Starting in 2011, the President institutionalized the retrospective review of regulations in Executive Orders 13563 and 13610, requiring agencies to report twice a year on the status of their efforts.  H.R. 1155, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, would make the process of retrospective regulatory review less productive.  Further, the bill also would create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty; increase costs for businesses and State, local and tribal governments; and impede common-sense protections for the American public.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1155 in its current form.   Although outside input and perspective on what rules may be ripe for potential reform or repeal is crucial, retrospective review is most effective when led by the agencies.  The bill's creation of a stand-alone commission to review the entire Code of Federal Regulations is likely to produce a haphazard list of rules that, under the procedures in the bill, must be repealed if approved by a joint resolution.  There appears to be no mechanism for making thoughtful and modest modifications to rules to improve their implementation and enforcement, which is often the best course of action for making regulations work better.  Moreover, the bill's \"cut-go\" approach is problematic:  it would interfere with the ability of agencies to issue regulations that are essential for the protection of public health, safety, and the environment.    The Administration recognizes that the applicability of \"cut-go\" in H.R. 1155 is narrower than in other bills being considered in the Congress.  Nonetheless, it is essential that agencies have the flexibility to promptly issue new, vital rules.  This ability should not be constrained by a Commission's recommendation, or Congressional approval of a list of repealable rules.  While retrospective review is an Administration priority and an essential tool to relieve unnecessary regulatory burden, it is important that retrospective review efforts not unnecessarily constrain an agency's ability to provide a timely response to critical public health or safety issues, or constrain its ability to implement new statutory provisions.  For these reasons, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1155 in its current form.  If the President were presented with the current version of H.R. 1155, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration is committed to addressing the opioid epidemic.

Every day that passes without Congressional action to support the treatment needs of those suffering from opioid use disorder is a missed opportunity to help the many communities facing the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.  Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that opioids \u2013 a class of drugs that includes prescription opioid pain medications and heroin \u2013 were involved in 28,647 deaths in 2014.  In addition to high rates of prescription opioid deaths, there have also been alarming increases in deaths from heroin and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.  In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for prescription opioids, which is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of pills.  Further, four in five new heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioid pain medications.  These trends will not change by simply authorizing new grant programs, studies and reports.  Congressional action is needed to fund the tools communities need to confront this epidemic and accelerate important policies like training health care providers on appropriate opioid prescribing, an essential component of this effort.  In February, the Administration submitted a robust proposal to the Congress to provide $1.1 billion in new funding to address this epidemic and expand access to treatment for prescription opioid abuse and heroin use to help individuals with an opioid use disorder seek treatment, successfully complete treatment, and sustain recovery.  This funding also would support the placement of substance use disorder treatment providers in the communities most in need, and would continue to build effective, evidence-based treatment programs.  The President's Budget builds on current efforts to expand prescription drug overdose prevention strategies, improve access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, and support targeted enforcement activities.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to secure the funding necessary to ensure that opioid use disorder treatment is available for those who seek it.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5538, making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.  The bill underfunds core Department of the Interior (DOI) programs as well as the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) operating budget, which supports nationwide protection of human health, and vital air, water and land resources.  The funding levels in the bill would significantly hamper investments that reduce future costs to taxpayers by facilitating increased energy development, ensuring adequate levels of cybersecurity, and maintaining operations, facilities and infrastructure in national parks, refuges, forests, public lands, and Indian Country.  These reductions would make it more difficult for States and businesses to plan and execute changes that would decrease carbon pollution and address the challenges facing the Nation from climate change.  They would also reduce support for partnerships and effective collaboration with States, Tribes, local governments, and private entities on efforts to restore and conserve natural and cultural resources.  Furthermore, the legislation includes numerous highly unacceptable provisions that have no place in funding legislation.  These provisions threaten to undermine the most basic protections for America's unique natural treasures and the people and wildlife that rely on them, as well as the ability of States and communities to address climate change and protect a resource that is essential to America's health\u2014clean water.  Despite these shortcomings, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in EPA's water infrastructure financing programs, including the State Revolving Funds for clean water and drinking water projects and the new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act loan program.  In addition, the Administration appreciates the Committee's investments in Indian Country, sagebrush ecosystem conservation, and National Park Service operations, though the Congress is encouraged to fully fund the requested increases in these areas.    In October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.     If the President were presented with H.R. 5538, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of the Interior (DOI)  Indian Affairs Priorities.  The Administration appreciates the funding level for Indian Affairs programs as a whole.  However, although the bill provides full funding for Contract Support Costs, and increases for the Tiwahe Initiative and important Indian Education programs, the bill does not include funding to address fundamental needs in Indian Country.  The bill fails to provide for much needed basic access to broadband and digital services in Indian schools, adequately facilitate access to Federal programs through a Native One-Stop Support Center, or strengthen data quality in Indian Country.  Further, it fails to help tribal communities manage natural resources, prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change, and support resolution of tribal land and water claims.  Oil and Gas Inspection Fees.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not include the FY 2017 Budget request to institute a new onshore oil and gas inspection fee program.  The program, which is similar to the program already in place for offshore operations, would cover the cost of onshore inspection activities and reduce by $48 million the net cost to taxpayers of operating Bureau of Land Management's oil and gas program.  Failure to adopt the new fees and associated funding would restrict BLM's ability to protect human safety, conserve energy resources, facilitate the proper reporting of oil and gas production, and ensure environmental requirements are being followed in all phases of development.  The bill also fails to include a proposed change to the Bureau of Safety and Environment Enforcement's inspection fee structure, which is necessary to ensure Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) operations are conducted safely and responsibly.   Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT).  The Administration is disappointed that the bill includes $480 million in discretionary resources for PILT, which the FY 2017 Budget request funds through a separate mandatory appropriation.  Inclusion of these discretionary funds in the bill comes at the expense of all other programs funded by the bill.  Restrictions on the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  The Administration strongly opposes sections 114, 118, 119, and 445 of the bill, which would undermine the ESA and limit the ability of the Fish and Wildlife Service to properly protect important species and habitats based on the best available science, including the greater sage grouse, lesser prairie chicken, delta smelt, and certain gray wolf populations.  Notably, the bill would circumvent established law, Federal process, and in some cases, judicial precedent.  These language provisions would create uncertainty and undermine unprecedented efforts to collaboratively conserve landscapes in concert with local ways of life.  Furthermore, the Administration strongly opposes sections 447 through 451 of the bill regarding management of water flows in California which would undercut the ESA, preempt California water law, fail to address critical elements of California's complex water challenges and impede an effective and timely response to the continuing drought while providing no additional water to hard hit communities.  These provisions could slow decision-making, generate significant litigation, and limit real-time operational flexibility critical to maximizing water delivery.  As the Administration stated in the past, these provisions were 2  developed with little input from the public, the Administration, or key stakeholders affected by the drought.  The urgency and seriousness of the California drought requires a balanced and flexible approach that promotes water reliability and ecosystem restoration.   Stream Protection Rule.  The Administration strongly opposes section 120 of the bill, which would prohibit the DOI's Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement (OSMRE) from finalizing or implementing the proposed Stream Protection Rule.  This rule would update 30-year old stream protection regulations to reflect modern science and technology and better protect people and the environment, provide industry more certainty, and address recent court decisions.  The current stream protection requirements governing surface mining activities rely on outdated scientific knowledge and mining and reclamation techniques.  The bill's attempt to block modern, science-based regulations would significantly impair the ability of OSMRE to accomplish the mission and responsibilities the Congress laid out in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, including preserving clean water and protecting human health and the environment.  In addition, the bill would undermine environmental protections, prevent the restoration of hundreds of streams, result in the deterioration of water quality for thousands of stream miles, create sustained regulatory uncertainty, and negatively impact public health for downstream communities.   Oil, Gas, and Coal Operations.  The Administration strongly opposes sections 122, 127, 440, and 441 of the bill which would undermine BLM's basic administrative authority to effectively oversee onshore fossil energy production on public lands.  Section 122 of the bill would prohibit BLM from regulating flaring, venting and leaks of methane from Federal onshore oil and gas operations; this effectively prevents BLM from using Mineral Leasing Act authority to reduce waste and improve fair return to the tax payer.  Section 440 of the bill infringes upon BLM's authority to adjust royalty rates where appropriate.  In addition, section 441 of the bill short-circuits the Administration's recently-announced comprehensive review of the Federal coal leasing program, thus impeding the Administration's ability to ensure a fair return to taxpayers from Federal coal development.  Section 127 of the bill prevents the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management from finalizing a rule on the air quality impacts from OCS oil and gas operations.   Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) Offshore Well Control Rule.  The Administration strongly opposes section 124 of the bill, which prohibits BSEE from developing, adopting, implementing, administering, or enforcing requirements pertaining to drilling safety margins, which represent a key provision of the BSEE's recently finalized Well Control Rule addressing drilling safety on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.  This prohibition would fundamentally undermine BSEE's role in overseeing OCS oil and gas operations, including efforts to reduce the risk of a catastrophic loss of well control such as the one that led to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  In addition, the rescission of BSEE's unobligated balances would prevent BSEE from meeting its safety and environmental protection responsibilities on behalf of the American public.  National Monument Restrictions.  The Administration strongly opposes section 453 of the bill, which would prohibit the President from exercising his authority under the Antiquities Act to designate national monuments in certain counties within eight States.  This would debilitate a successful program that has been used to protect areas critical to the Nation's natural and cultural heritage such as Bandelier National Monument and the Statue of Liberty.  BLM Planning 2.0.  The Administration strongly opposes section 443 of the bill, which would 3  significantly delay BLM from promulgating, implementing, or enforcing its Planning 2.0 rulemaking to improve BLM's land use planning.  This delay would prevent BLM from finalizing a rule that supports Administration goals of facilitating science-based, landscape-level planning with early public involvement.  Hunting, Fishing, and Recreational Shooting.  The Administration strongly opposes limits on the closure of land management areas to hunting, which infringe upon the authority of BLM's field managers and fail to provide the public sufficient time or flexibility to develop effective long-term solutions at the local level to address long-term resource conflicts, resource protection needs, and public safety issues associated with recreational target shooting.  Water Rights.  The Administration strongly opposes section 433 of the bill, which would restrict the use of funds to implement water rights administration and management by the Federal Government.  This language is unnecessary for its intended purpose, and would preclude land management agencies from protecting the public interest.  This provision would eliminate the ability of land management agencies to maintain sufficient water for other congressionally-designated purposes and ensure water rights are tied to the activities for which they were developed.  These restrictions would also hamper cooperative work with land users to improve land conditions, such as range improvements, or conduct habitat mitigation activities as part of land use agreements.  National Historic Preservation Act.  The Administration opposes section 123 of the bill, which would allow Federal agencies to object to a designation of Federal properties for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.  Listing a property on the National Register of Historic Places, or designating it as a National Historic Landmark, does not limit any Federal agency's decision-making authority.  Decisions on how to manage the property, informed by the evaluation of its significance and integrity, remain the responsibility of the agency with jurisdiction over that property.  The Administration is not aware of any specific instance where such a designation has adversely affected national security.  Enactment of this section could lead to a fundamental weakening of highly successful and widely admired programs that recognize and protect the Nation's shared heritage.  Federal Acknowledgement of American Indian Tribes Rule.  The Administration opposes section 125 of the bill, which would block DOI from implementing, administering, or enforcing the final Federal acknowledgment rule.  The final rule makes much needed changes to the previous rules criticized by Tribes and the Congress as in need of reform.  These important changes were made in consultation with and at the request of Tribes, States, local governments, and the public.  Blocking this rule leaves the Federal acknowledgement program without a governing structure, effectively halting the Administration's role in the process.  To uphold the principle of tribal sovereignty, it is important that the Federal Government have a clear and objective process to determine which Tribes it recognizes.  Administrative recognition provides an orderly process.  Land into Trust.  The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to address the need to clarify and reaffirm the Secretary of the Interior's authority to acquire land in trust under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA).  In Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 397 (2009), the Supreme Court held that the Secretary could acquire land in trust under IRA only for Tribes that were \"under Federal jurisdiction\" in 1934.  The Administration continues to support language requested in the FY 2017 Budget to extend this authority to all Tribes, whether recognized in 1934 or later.  Such legislation would be consistent with the longstanding policy of assisting Tribes in 4  establishing and protecting a land base sufficient to allow them to provide for the health, welfare, and safety of tribal members, and in treating all Tribes equally for purposes of setting aside lands for tribal communities.  Section 128 of the bill takes a far more limited approach, however, simply reaffirming that certain land taken into trust before the Carcieri decision shall continue to be trust land.  DOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service  Wildland Fire Suppression.  The Administration is deeply disappointed that the Committee did not take a stronger position toward the enactment of a cap adjustment for wildfire suppression in this bill, and instead, focused on the inclusion of a provision that is potentially disruptive of the environmental analysis required under the National Environmental Policy Act.  The Administration's cap adjustment proposal is a fiscally responsible strategy to provide discretionary resources for suppression of 98 percent of wildland fires with 70 percent of the 10-year average cost in base appropriations.  This includes a disaster funding cap adjustment to meet suppression needs for the remaining two percent of fires that become catastrophic in size and cost and consume 30 percent of suppression resources.  Continued inaction on this proposal, which has bipartisan support, would increase the likelihood of disruptive fire transfers in future years and harm all other Forest Service Programs.  Passage of the proposal is of paramount concern for the Administration in order to protect programs that pre-emptively reduce fire risk and future fire costs by restoring the health of forests and watersheds.  Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).  The Administration objects to the drastic reduction of $129 million, or 27 percent, from the discretionary funding requested in the FY 2017 Budget for DOI and USDA LWCF programs.  LWCF is a cornerstone of Federal conservation and recreation conservation efforts.  This funding level would severely impede agency capacity to further protect the Nation's natural heritage.  To date, LWCF has contributed to the protection of key public lands, such as Olympic National Park, Everglades National Park, and important assets in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, among others, as well as State and local recreation projects and important cultural heritage sites.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  Operating Budget.  The Administration strongly opposes the $399 million reduction of EPA's operating budget, or 11 percent, compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  This unacceptable reduction in funding would significantly undermine key actions to address climate change and improve air quality.  In particular, the bill would inhibit EPA's ability to implement commonsense standards and voluntary programs, provide timely guidance and technical assistance to State and tribal air agencies, improve flexibility and enhance partnership with the States, support communities in efforts to combat localized effects of air pollution, and continue making progress toward eliminating the State implementation plan backlog.  Further, this funding level would significantly reduce EPA's ability to enforce and oversee critical environmental protections for air, water, and land, including decreased capacity to find and develop civil and criminal cases against companies and individuals responsible for contaminating the environment.  The funding level would also severely hinder EPA's work to strengthen environmental planning efforts, educate the public about environmental risks, and address pollution in underserved communities.  These reductions would also hamper some of EPA's critical geographic program efforts, including those in the Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound, and Southern New England Estuaries.  In addition, reductions to EPA's cybersecurity funding would severely impede EPA's ability to take necessary 5  action to protect, defend, and sustain vital information and records, including personal information.  State Categorical Grants.  The Administration opposes the $100 million reduction to the State and Tribal Categorical Grants account compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  Often, States and Tribes implement environmental programs through delegated authorities.  However, the bill reduces these grants to States and Tribes, severely limiting their ability to carry out activities such as water quality permitting, air monitoring, and hazardous waste management programs.  For example, the bill reduces funding for environmental information grants by $16 million, or  62 percent, compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduction would hamper system modernizations through the E-Enterprise approach and the efficiencies and long-term cost savings they would bring for many of the tools needed by industry and the States, as well as ease of use by the public.  In addition, the bill reduces funding for brownfields projects by $10 million compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduced level of funding severely restricts opportunities for communities to revitalize their contaminated lands to improve environmental quality and spark economic redevelopment.  e-Manifest.  The Administration objects to the reduction of funding for e-Manifest development, EPA's system for electronically tracking the transport of hazardous waste.  While the Administration acknowledges the concern about the pace of development of e-Manifest, full funding in FY 2017 is essential to finishing the system in time for a planned launch in calendar year 2018.  Oil Spill Prevention and Preparedness.  The bill fails to recognize the risks associated with the increased production of domestic oil resources by failing to provide the necessary increases for inspections, training, and compliance offered through the Inland Oil Spills Programs Account.  Hazardous Substance Superfund.  The Administration objects to the reductions made to the Hazardous Substance Superfund Account.  These programs ensure that polluters pay for the contamination they caused before that burden is unfairly levied upon the general tax payer, fund cleanup activities where no viable responsible party has been identified, and provide oversight and assistance to Federal agencies who are actively engaged in cleaning up sites they own or operate.  Robust funding within the account is necessary to protect the public and address the release of hazardous substances.   Greenhouse Gas Limits for Power Plants.  The Administration strongly objects to section 431 of the bill, which would block the Clean Power Plan as well as carbon pollution standards for power plants promulgated under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act.  Although the Clean Power Plan is currently stayed pending judicial review, this provision seeks to derail this critical component of the Administration's efforts to combat climate change regardless of the outcome of judicial review.  The Administration is confident the Clean Power Plan will be upheld when the courts address its merits because the Plan rests on strong scientific and legal foundations.  Clean Water Act (CWA) Jurisdiction.  The Administration believes that the CWA provisions in the bill undermine efforts to protect America's water resources, which are critical to the health of American families and businesses.  The Administration strongly objects to section 427 in particular, which would disrupt the Administration's current efforts, and prevent future efforts, to clarify the scope of CWA.  This would result in significant ambiguity and regulatory uncertainty for the public. 6   National Ambient Air Quality Standards Ozone Rule.  The Administration strongly objects to section 438 of the bill, which would delay and undermine implementation of the 2015 ozone health standard.  Ozone pollution, also known as smog, has been linked to a range of adverse health effects that can lead to missed work and school days, increased hospital admissions, and premature deaths from respiratory and cardiovascular causes.  This provision would result in people living in areas with unhealthy ozone levels for additional years, delaying health benefits worth billions of dollars for millions of Americans, including the most vulnerable\u2014children, older adults, and people with asthma.  EPA's science-based air standards, which undergo rigorous public review and comment, have a proven record of success.  The standards have resulted in cleaner air which has helped all Americans live longer, healthier lives in a growing economy.  Oil and Gas Methane Emissions Standards.  The Administration strongly objects to section 439 of the bill, which would block commonsense standards for sources of emissions of methane, volatile organic compounds, and toxic pollutants in the oil and natural gas industry.  Methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide, and is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the United States from human activities.  Not only is reducing these emissions an essential component of the Administration's efforts to combat climate change, emission reductions would also have meaningful public health benefits for Americans.  This provision would also prevent EPA from providing valuable and much needed technical guidance on emissions control techniques to State, tribal, and local air agencies in moderate or above nonattainment ground-level ozone areas and the ozone transport region.  It would also prevent EPA from clarifying the scope of an emissions source to provide greater certainty for the regulated community, permitting authorities, and the public.  Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).  The Administration regards the SCC as an essential component of the rulemaking process and opposes the Congress's interference with the Interagency Working Group's (IWG) development of the SCC.  The Administration strongly objects to section 436 of the bill, which would force the IWG to revise the SCC using only a limited set of discount rates and \"domestic\" SCC values.  This revision ignores the trans-boundary movement of carbon and climate impacts, fails to capture key costs of carbon emissions, and disrupts upcoming rules that would use the SCC to monetize carbon reduction benefits.  Limitations on Significant New Alternatives Policy under the Clean Air Act.  The Administration strongly objects to section 434 of the bill, which would block the finalization, implementation, and enforcement of a rule to prohibit certain uses of climate super-pollutants known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).  Domestic action to reduce use of HFCs is consistent with U.S. advocacy for addressing HFCs on a global basis, such as through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol.  Classification of Forest Biomass Fuels as Carbon-Neutral.  The Administration recognizes the role that biomass can play in reducing overall net carbon emissions in the United States, including in the implementation of the Clean Power Plan.  The EPA and its Science Advisory Board are assessing the net biogenic carbon emissions associated with the use of different biomass feedstocks for energy.  The Administration strongly objects to language under the heading \"Administrative Provisions\u2014Environmental Protection Agency\" in the bill, which would compel EPA to disregard the scientific recommendations of its own Science Advisory Board and other technical studies. 7   Pesticide Worker Protection Information Access.  The Administration strongly objects to section 437, which would prevent implementation or enforcement of a recently published pesticide worker protection regulation, a commonsense measure that allows a worker or handler's designated representative to access required safety and hazard information for pesticides to which that worker may have been exposed.  This provision unacceptably reduces at-risk individuals' access to critical job safety information.  Aquifer Exemptions.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill under the heading \"Administrative Provisions\u2014Environmental Protection Agency,\" which would preclude EPA from revising its regulatory criteria for aquifer exemptions involving underground injection.  This provision is in conflict with existing EPA regulations and guidance, and would cause results inconsistent with the intent of the Safe Drinking Water Act by preventing EPA from being able to protect some underground sources of drinking water.  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) 108(b) Financial Assurance.  The Administration objects to section 430 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to develop, propose, finalize, and implement financial responsibility requirements under CERCLA 108(b).  This provision severely limits EPA's ability to comply with the court order, abrogates EPA's responsibilities laid out in CERCLA 108(b), and passes the cost of future cleanup activities from the polluter to the taxpayer.  Lead Test Kits.  The Administration objects to section 429 of the bill, which would potentially disrupt EPA's current activities under the 2008 Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting rule until either EPA approves a commercially available \"improved\" lead paint test kit or solicits public comment on alternatives to current testing options.  Children and developing fetuses are especially sensitive to lead exposure, and EPA's efforts to protect vulnerable populations during home renovation projects would be undermined.  Department of Health and Human Services  Indian Health Service (IHS).  The Administration strongly supports increased investment in IHS and commends the Committee for funding health care services for American Indians and Alaska Natives.  However, the Administration is concerned that the funding provided for IHS is $106 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  These additional funds are needed to provide critical program increases to help close the gap in health disparities experienced by American Indians and Alaska Natives.  The Administration also is concerned that section 446 would create new improper governance structures for IHS facilities.  Contract Support Costs.  The Administration opposes changes made by the bill to the IHS Contract Support Costs account that removes a proviso allowing IHS to credit a contract support cost overpayment against contract support costs due in subsequent fiscal years.  Without this language, IHS would need to collect contract support cost overpayments from Tribes at the end of each fiscal year.  This process would be overly burdensome for both IHS and Tribes.  Other Independent Agencies  Smithsonian Institution.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Smithsonian's request.  In particular, the reductions to the Salaries and Expenses account could force the Smithsonian to reduce programmatic activities and museum access for the public in order to cover 8  growing fixed costs.  Other Issues  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOI and EPA to implement the DATA Act.  This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOI and EPA to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  9  ", "The Administration strongly supports enactment of the Senate Amendments to H.R. 1314, the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2015.  Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is a vital tool for enabling the United States to expand economic opportunities, break down barriers, and establish global economic rules that support strong and enforceable standards that promote workers\u2019 rights, the environment, and a free and open Internet.  U.S. exports support more than 11 million American jobs, which, on average, pay up to 18 percent more than jobs in other industries.  Enacting TPA will help America take another step toward delivering trade agreements that not only open new markets to \u2018Made in America\u2019 goods, but also level the playing field consistent with the Nation\u2019s values and priorities.  This multi-title bill would grant TPA to support the negotiation of high-standard trade agreements that are good for the U.S. economy, businesses, farmers, innovators and workers, and would extend and enhance the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program.  The bill makes important updates to U.S. negotiating objectives that will promote human rights, facilitate digital trade, address state-owned enterprises, tackle localization barriers, and address currency issues in trade agreements subject to the bill.  The Senate Amendments to H.R. 1314 also provide a significant increase in the requirements for consultation, transparency, and accountability with Congress, stakeholders, and the public regarding such agreements.  Additionally, the bill will ensure that the United States will continue to maintain the highest level of health, safety, consumer, environmental, labor, and financial protections that ensure Federal, State and local governments continue to have the right to regulate in the public interest.   The Senate Amendments to H.R. 1314 regarding TAA are an important partner to TPA, and would provide employment-related services and benefits to American workers and firms, helping all Americans participate in the global economy.  By providing income support, job training, re-employment services, and other services, TAA would help trade-impacted workers enter new industries and careers and would give firms access to the tools they need to compete.  In addition to extending TAA services for American workers and firms, this bill would reinstate key provisions from the 2009 and 2011 TAA reauthorizations that were regrettably allowed to expire.  For example, the bill would expand coverage to again include service sector workers and workers whose jobs have shifted to China, India, and other countries.  Reinstatement and reauthorization of the TAA expansion provisions first enacted in 2009 would significantly increase the number of workers who have access to TAA benefits.  It would provide up to 130 weeks of Trade Readjustment Allowance benefits, restore case management and employment services and the enhanced older worker wage supplement program, and maintain job search and relocation assistance.  It also would raise the annual cap for job training and other activities to $450 million per year \u2013 from the $220 million annual training cap under current law.  The  Administration looks forward to working with Congress to secure the needed resources to effectively implement and administer a reinstated Health Coverage Tax Credit.     The Administration also looks forward to providing technical assistance as necessary and continuing to work with Congress on successful passage and implementation on this important legislation.      * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes S.J.Res. 22, which would nullify a specified Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army (Army) final rule clarifying the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The agencies' rulemaking, grounded in science and the law, is essential to ensure clean water for future generations, and is responsive to calls for rulemaking from the Congress, industry, and community stakeholders as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The final rule has been through an extensive public engagement process.   Clean water is vital for the success of the Nation's businesses, agriculture, energy development, and the health of our communities.  More than one in three Americans get their drinking water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that are at risk of pollution from upstream sources.  The protection of wetlands is also vital for hunting and fishing.  When Congress passed the CWA in 1972 to restore the Nation's waters, it recognized that to have healthy communities downstream, we need to protect the smaller streams and wetlands upstream.     Clarifying the scope of the CWA helps to protect clean water, safeguard public health, and strengthen the economy.  Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 focused on specific jurisdictional determinations and rejected the analytical approach that the Army Corps of Engineers used for those determinations, but did not invalidate the underlying regulation.  This has created ongoing questions and uncertainty about how the regulation is applied consistent with the Court's decisions.  The final rule was developed to address this uncertainty and it should remain in place.    If enacted, S.J.Res. 22 would nullify years of work and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water.  EPA and Army have sought the views of and listened carefully to the public throughout the extensive public engagement process for this rule.    Simply put, S.J.Res. 22 is not an act of good governance.  It would sow confusion and invite conflict at a time when our communities and businesses need clarity and certainty around clean water regulation.    If the President were presented with S.J.Res. 22, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3340, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act, which seeks to subject the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR) to Congressional appropriations.  The bill also would require the OFR to submit quarterly reports to the Congress regarding its activities and to provide a public notice and comment period of at least 90 days before issuing any report, rule, or regulation.  Subjecting these bodies to Congressional appropriations would hinder their independence and could limit their ability to monitor and address threats to financial stability.    The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Wall Street Reform) created FSOC to bring independent regulators together with a collective responsibility for monitoring risks across the system, wherever they may arise, and to identify and respond to emerging threats to financial stability.  Before FSOC, no single entity was accountable for monitoring and responding to risks to financial stability.  Similarly, the OFR plays a unique role in promoting financial stability by identifying and filling in gaps in data and knowledge about the financial system, monitoring financial stability metrics across the system, conducting independent research on financial stability policies and providing FSOC with data and analytical support.    Wall Street Reform provided FSOC and the OFR with permanent funding through assessments on the largest financial institutions, including bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.  This funding system ensures that large financial institutions bear the costs of protecting financial stability.  Maintaining a funding source independent of political interference allows FSOC and the OFR to function at full capacity and focus on threats to financial stability.  Moreover, funding FSOC and the OFR through appropriations would subject these entities to political gamesmanship that could hinder their ability to conduct independent research, ask questions, and analyze information about industries, firms, or activities \u2014 running the risk of ignoring the next threat to financial stability.    If the President were presented with H.R. 3340, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration welcomes the bill's investments in military infrastructure, housing, and services for men and women in our Armed Forces and their families.  In addition, the Administration appreciates the Committee's commitment to fund the benefits and services our veterans have earned, and provide the requested advanced appropriations.  However, the bill does not fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and includes objectionable restrictions on performance awards for VA Senior Executive Service civil servants.  In addition, the Administration strongly objects to the bill's unwarranted restrictions on the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, as these restrictions further impede the Executive Branch's efforts to responsibly close the facility.   In October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the final bill that is presented to the President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Military Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Department of Defense's military construction and family housing requirements.  Detainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to section 512 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This provision would constrain the flexibility that the Executive Branch needs to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees,  based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  The Administration also objects to section 136 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to carry out realignment of the U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay.  While this provision is intended to preserve U.S. control of the U.S. Naval Station, it may restrict the Administration's ability to relocate the functions and civilian personnel positions in support of the detainee mission.  Veterans Affairs Funding.  The Administration objects to the $1.5 billion reduction from the FY 2017 Budget request for VA, including a decrease of $1.2 billion from the request for Medical Care.  This reduction would negatively impact veterans' access to medical care and reduce VA's ability to maintain medical facility infrastructure and activate new and replacement facilities with sufficient staff and equipment.  In addition, the bill does not include the request for general transfer authority, which would provide VA needed funding flexibility to address high priority needs.  Veterans Affairs Senior Executive Service (SES) Performance Award Restrictions.  The Administration objects to section 237 of the bill, which would prohibit performance awards for VA SES civil servants.  This provision would decrease morale among VA's workforce, disadvantage high-performing SES employees, and could prevent VA from attracting and retaining top talent committed to serving veterans.  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for VA to implement the DATA Act.  This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for VA to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.  Constitutional Concerns  Additional provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, section 113 of the bill may interfere with the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief, and sections 201, 202, 219, 225, 229, 230, 231, and language in title II under the headings \"Information Technology Systems\" and \"Construction, Major Projects\" raise separation of powers concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of Senate Amendment 2689 to H.R. 719, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year (FY) 2016, and for other purposes.  The Amendment allows critical Government functions to operate without interruption, providing a short-term bridge to give the Congress time to pass a budget for the remainder of the fiscal year.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on FY 2016 appropriations legislation for the full year that reverses sequestration, preserves funding for critical national priorities, protects national security, and makes investments to maintain economic growth and job creation for years to come.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports enactment of the Senate Amendments to H.R. 1295, the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015, which would extend the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and the preferential duty treatment program for Haiti.  AGOA is the cornerstone of our economic relationship with sub-Saharan Africa, and a seamless, long-term renewal of the program improves the environment for investment, two-way trade, development, and economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa.  The Administration welcomes a 10-year extension of the program, including of the third-country fabric provisions.  This will give buyers the certainty they need to build local supply chains and consider Africa as a destination for investment and a source for their purchases.  The Administration is also pleased that the bill includes changes that will improve implementation of the program, such as streamlined rules of origin and updates to the process to review country eligibility. In addition to extending AGOA, the bill also renews the GSP program through December 31, 2017.  GSP promotes economic growth in the developing world by eliminating duties on a wide range of products from developing countries.  GSP also supports U.S. jobs by lowering the cost of imported inputs, which helps to keep U.S. manufacturers competitive, and reduces prices on many U.S. consumer goods.  The legislation also designates certain cotton articles for potential duty-free treatment under the GSP program for least-developed countries, pursuant to undertakings by the United States in the World Trade Organization.   The bill also extends the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act (HOPE II) for five years, from 2020 to 2025.  Haiti remains the poorest country in the Americas, and one of the poorest in the world, with a significant need for basic services.  The HOPE program has been instrumental in economic development in Haiti, especially in the textile and apparel sector.  Early extension of this program will provide the stability and continuity needed to help ensure that companies will continue to invest in Haiti\u2019s future.   * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1994, as amended by the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee.  While the Administration believes strongly that Federal employees must be held accountable for their performance and actions, H.R. 1994 fails to provide tools to further that goal, and in fact would be counterproductive for the reasons expressed below.   The bill compiles a number of separate personnel policy bills aimed solely at the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) workforce, creating a disparity in the treatment of one group of career civil servants.  The centerpiece of the bill is a provision that allows a VA employee to be removed from Federal service or demoted without the opportunity to appeal that decision to the full Merit Systems Protection Board.  An employee who has been removed or demoted under this provision is instead subject to an abbreviated review process before an administrative law judge that may in some cases deprive employees of any appellate review whatsoever.  These provisions remove important rights, protections, and incentives which are available to the vast majority of Federal employees in other agencies across the Government and are essential to ensure that Federal employees are afforded due process.  Other provisions of the bill, such as those that would mandate rotation of VA Senior Executive employees every five years or impose arbitrary restrictions on performance ratings provided to VA Senior Executives, would also be disruptive and would hinder VA\u2019s ability to function effectively on behalf of veterans.  Under current law, Federal employees, including VA employees, may be terminated for a variety of reasons, ranging from absence without leave and inability to maintain performance standards to serious offenses such as falsification of records, misuse of government property, or sexual harassment.  While VA supports authority permitting efficient removal of employees who have engaged in misconduct, this bill will have unintended consequences.  It would make conditions of employment in VA significantly less attractive than in other Federal agencies or in the private sector, and as a result, would discourage outstanding VA employees from remaining in VA and dramatically impair VA\u2019s ability to recruit top talent, including veterans.  Currently, VA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, Office of the Medical Inspector, and the newly established Office of Accountability Review provide strong oversight independent of its field organizations.   The legislation raises serious concerns under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  It could also raise concerns under the Due Process Clause depending upon its application.  The bill could have a significant impact on VA\u2019s ability to retain and recruit qualified professionals and may result in a loss of qualified and capable staff to other government agencies or the private sector.   If the President were presented with H.R. 1994, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes S.J.Res. 23, which would undermine the public health protections of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and stop critical U.S. efforts to reduce dangerous carbon pollution from power plants.  In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the CAA gives the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution.  In 2009, EPA determined that GHG pollution threatens Americans' health and welfare by leading to long-lasting changes to the climate that can, and are already, having a range of negative effects on human health and the environment.  This finding is consistent with conclusions of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and numerous other national and international scientific bodies.  Power plants account for roughly one-third of all domestic GHG emissions.  While the United States limits dangerous emissions of arsenic, mercury, lead, particulate matter, and ozone precursor pollution from power plants, the Carbon Pollution Standards and the Clean Power Plan put into place the first national limits on power plant carbon pollution.  The Carbon Pollution Standards will ensure that new, modified, and reconstructed power plants deploy available systems of emission reduction to reduce carbon pollution.    S.J.Res. 23 would nullify carbon pollution standards for future power plants and power plants undertaking significant modifications or reconstruction, thus slowing our country's transition to cleaner, cutting-edge power generation technologies.  Most importantly, the resolution could enable continued build-out of outdated, high-polluting, and long-lived power generation infrastructure and impede efforts to reduce carbon pollution from new and modified power plants \u2013 when the need to act, and to act quickly, to mitigate climate change impacts on American communities has never been more clear.   Since it was enacted in 1970, and amended in 1977 and 1990, each time with strong bipartisan support, the CAA has improved the Nation's air quality and protected public health. Over that same period of time, the economy has tripled in size while emissions of key pollutants have decreased by more than 70 percent.  Forty-five years of clean air regulation have shown that a strong economy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.   Because S.J.Res. 23 threatens the health and economic welfare of future generations by blocking important standards to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector that take a flexible, common sense approach to addressing carbon pollution, if the President were presented with S.J.Res. 23, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration is strongly committed to a free and open Internet, and thus ensuring that no party can restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas.  Essential to this policy is ensuring that no cable or phone company can act as a gatekeeper, restricting what Americans can do or see online.  That is why the Administration supports the Federal Communication Commission's decision in February 2015 to issue an Open Internet order providing strong, clear, carefully designed rules that prevent broadband providers from favoring certain Internet content over others.  H.R. 4596, the Small Business Broadband Deployment Act, would extend a temporary exemption for small businesses from the Open Internet order's enhanced disclosure rules for five years and expand the definition of a small business.  The Administration does not oppose House passage of H.R. 4596 in its current form, as reported by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  The Administration, however, will not support any attempt to undermine the important consumer and economic protections in the Open Internet order that are supported by millions of Americans.  The Administration looks forward to continued conversations with the Congress to help ensure a free and open Internet.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 1206, the No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act; H.R. 4890, the IRS Bonuses Tied to Measurable Metrics Act; and H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2015.  These bills would impose unnecessary constraints on the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) operations without improving the agency's ability to administer the tax code and serve taxpayers.  H.R. 1206 would prohibit the IRS from hiring any new employees until the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that no IRS employee has a seriously delinquent debt, or provides a report to the Congress that includes an explanation of why certification is not possible and what would be required to provide such a certification. The bill could result in the IRS being prohibited from hiring any new employees for any purpose \u2013 a drastic and counterproductive step that would compromise tax administration and taxpayer services.  The bill is also unworkable in operation, as \"seriously delinquent\" debts could be as low as $1 and tax liens are recorded on a case-by-case basis.  This legislation is unnecessary, as strong laws and procedures already exist to ensure that IRS employees comply with their tax obligations.  Publicly-available data show that IRS employees are among the most tax compliant groups in the Nation with a delinquency rate of less than 1 percent.    H.R. 4890 would ban performance awards to IRS employees until the Secretary of the Treasury develops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy.  This bill is unnecessary, as the IRS has already developed and has begun to execute a strategy to improve taxpayer services.  The real constraint on the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers effectively is severe underfunding, including for taxpayer services.  IRS funding is more than $900 million below its 2010 level, before adjusting for inflation.  These budget cuts have impeded the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers, including inadequate responses to taxpayer calls and correspondence.  Filing season statistics show that taxpayer service has improved this year as a result of a small funding increase provided last year, but more resources are needed to serve all taxpayers effectively and efficiently.  Legislation constraining the IRS's ability to retain and recruit highly qualified employees is not needed and could be counterproductive to the Service's mission.  H.R. 3724 would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily separated due to misconduct.  The bill as written could force the immediate termination of employees who had been terminated and rehired many years ago, even if their performance since rehiring has been blemish-free.  The bill's prohibition is also unnecessary because current IRS processes  already ensure the agency does not rehire former employees who had significant conduct or performance problems during prior employment with the agency.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5293, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.    While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for certain investments in our national defense, H.R. 5293 fails to provide our troops with the resources needed to keep our Nation safe.  At a time when ISIL continues to threaten the homeland and our allies, the bill does not fully fund wartime operations such as INHERENT RESOLVE.  Instead the bill would redirect $16 billion of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds toward base budget programs that the Department of Defense (DOD) did not request, shortchanging funding for ongoing wartime operations midway through the year.  Not only is this approach dangerous but it is also wasteful.  The bill would buy excess force structure without the money to sustain it, effectively creating a hollow force structure that would undermine DOD's efforts to restore readiness.  Furthermore, the bill's funding approach attempts to unravel the dollar-for-dollar balance of defense and non-defense funding increases provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), threatening future steps needed to reverse over $100 billion of future sequestration cuts to DOD.  By gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and women fighting to keep America safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies.    In addition, H.R. 5293 would impose other unneeded costs, constraining DOD's ability to balance military capability, capacity, and readiness.  The Administration's defense strategy depends on investing every dollar where it will have the greatest effect.  The Administration's FY 2017 proposals would accomplish this by continuing and expanding critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, balance growth in military compensation, modernize military health care, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The bill fails to adopt many of these reforms, including through measures prohibiting the use of funds to propose or plan for a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.  The bill also continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay that threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  In October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the BBA, which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration looks forward to working with the  Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  However, the bill is inconsistent with the BBA, and the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5293, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Defense (DOD)  Reduction and Misuse of OCO Funds.  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's proposal to substitute $16 billion of DOD's OCO request in the FY 2017 Budget with $16 billion of unsustainable base budget programs that do not reflect the Department's highest joint priorities.  This approach creates a hollow force structure and risks the loss of funding for critical overseas contingency operations.  This gimmick is inconsistent with the BBA, which provided equal increases for defense and non-defense spending as well as the certainty needed to prosecute the counter-ISIL campaign, protect readiness recovery, modernize the force for future conflicts, and keep faith with servicemembers and their families.  Shortchanging wartime operations by $16 billion would deplete essential funding for ongoing operations by the middle of the year, introducing a dangerous level of uncertainty for our men and women in uniform carrying out missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere.  Our troops need and deserve guaranteed, predictable support as they execute their missions year round, particularly in light of the dangers they face in executing the Nation's ongoing overseas contingency operations.  Guantanamo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 8097, 8098, 8099, and 8130 of the bill, which would restrict the Executive Branch's ability to manage the detainee population at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility.  Section 8098 would prohibit the use of funds for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States.  Sections 8097 and 8099 would continue prohibitions and restrictions relating to transfers of detainees abroad.  In addition, section 8130 would restrict the Department's ability to transfer U.S. Naval Station functions in support of national security.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions.  Operating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Sections 8097 and 8099 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles in certain circumstances.  Military End Strength.  The Administration strongly objects to the unnecessary funding for end strength levels above the FY 2017 Budget request.  The bill would force the Department to take additional risk in the training and readiness of the current force, as well as investment in and procurement of future capabilities.  Adding unnecessary end strength in the manner proposed in the bill would increase military personnel and operation and maintenance support costs by approximately $30 billion (FY 2017 through FY 2021).  This would also invite a significant, 2  unacceptable risk of creating a future hollow force, in which force structure exists, but the resources to make it ready do not follow.  The Administration urges support of the Department's plan, which reflects sound strategy and responsible choices among capacity, capabilities, and current and future readiness.  Military Compensation Reform.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee has rejected the pay raise proposal and most of the health care reform proposals included in the FY 2017 Budget request.  The FY 2017 Budget request includes a set of commonsense reforms that would allow the Department to achieve a proper balance between DOD's obligation to provide competitive pay and benefits to servicemembers and its responsibility to provide troops the finest training and equipment possible.  The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to support these reforms, which would save $500 million in FY 2017 and $11 billion through FY 2021.  Availability of Funds for Retirement or Inactivation of Ticonderoga-Class Cruisers or Dock Landing Ships.  The Administration strongly objects to section 8124 of the bill, which would prohibit the Navy from executing its phased modernization approach for maintaining an effective cruiser and dock landing ship force structure while balancing scarce operating and maintenance funding.  It also would significantly reduce planned savings and accelerate the retirement of all Ticonderoga-Class cruisers.  The Navy's current requirement for active large surface combatants includes 11 Air Defense Commander ships, one assigned to each of the active carrier strike groups.  This requirement is met by the modernization plan proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request.  Furthermore, section 8124 would require an additional $3.2 billion across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) to fund manpower, maintenance, modernization, and operations when compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  Restoration of Tenth Navy Carrier Air Wing.  The Administration strongly objects to restoration of the Carrier Air Wing in Title IX of the bill.  The tenth Carrier Air Wing is no longer needed, and results in ineffective use of the aircraft and pilot inventory in the Navy.  The plan proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request optimizes Carrier Air Wing force structure to meet the Global Force Management Allocation Plan demand in a sustainable way.  As an additional benefit, the plan also generates $926 million in FYDP savings.  Furthermore, if forced to retain the tenth Carrier Air Wing, the bill's current military personnel funding levels are insufficient.  The Navy would require an additional $48 million in FY 2017 for military personnel above the levels already in the bill, as well as an end strength increase of 1,167 above the Navy end strength in the bill.  Restoration of Third Littoral Combat Ship.  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's proposal to increase the purchase of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) in FY 2017 from two to three.  The FY 2017 Budget request reduced from 52 to 40 the total number of LCS and Frigates (FF) the Navy would purchase over the life of the program.  A combined program of 40 LCS and FF would allow DOD to invest in advanced capabilities across the fleet and would provide sufficient capacity to meet the Department's warfighting needs and to exceed recent presence levels with a more modern and capable ship than legacy mine sweepers, frigates, and coastal patrol craft they would replace.  By funding two LCS in FY 2017, the Budget request ensures that both shipyards are on equal footing and have robust production leading up to the competition to select the shipyard that would continue the program.  This competitive environment ensures the best price for the taxpayer on the remaining ships, while also achieving savings by down-selecting to one shipyard.  The bill prevents the use of resources for higher 3  priorities to improve DOD's warfighting capability, such as undersea, other surface, and aviation investments.  Prohibition on Proposing, Planning, or Conducting an Additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Round.  The Administration strongly objects to section 8121 of the bill and the proposed $3.5 million reduction to funds that would support a 2019 BRAC round.  By forcing the Department to spread its resources more thinly, excess infrastructure is one of the principal drains on the Department's readiness, which the Committee recognizes as a major concern.  In addition to addressing every previous congressional objection to BRAC authorization, the Department recently conducted a DOD-wide parametric capacity analysis, which demonstrates that the Department has 22 percent excess capacity.  In addition, the Administration's BRAC legislative proposal includes several changes that respond to congressional concerns regarding cost.  Specifically, the revised BRAC legislation requires the Secretary to certify that BRAC would have the primary objective of eliminating excess capacity and reducing costs, emphasizes recommendations that yield net savings within five years (subject to military value), and limits recommendations that take longer than 20 years to pay back.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can make better use of scarce resources to maintain readiness.  Asia-Pacific Rebalance Infrastructure.  The Administration strongly objects to the exclusion of a general provision requested in the FY 2017 Budget that would allow for $86.7 million of the amounts appropriated for the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide account to be available for the Secretary of Defense to make grants, conclude cooperative agreements, and supplement other Federal funds.  This critical provision addresses the need to provide assistance for civilian water and wastewater improvements to support the military build-up on Guam, as well as critical existing and enduring military installations and missions on Guam.  A key aspect of the Asia-Pacific rebalance is to create a more operationally resilient Marine Corps presence in the Pacific and invest in Guam as a joint strategic hub.  This funding supports the ability and flexibility of the President to execute our foreign and defense policies in coordination with our ally, Japan.  In addition, it calls into question among regional states our commitment to implement the realignment plan and our ability to execute our defense strategy.  Prohibition of Funds to Enforce Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  The Administration strongly objects to section 8132 of the bill, which would prohibit DOD from using FY 2017 funds to enforce section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  Section 526 provides an environmentally sound framework for the development of future alternative fuels.  Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle.  The Administration objects to the reductions to both the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle and the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Infrastructure requested in the FY 2017 Budget.  The Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle reduction would eliminate three launch service procurements, instead of the two procurements the Committee intended.  Further, the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Infrastructure reduction exceeds the amount ascribed to these two procurements, and would cause the Government to default on the current contract and the block buy, unnecessarily introducing costs and schedule risk for national security space payloads.  Missile Defense Programs.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $324 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for U.S. ballistic missile defense programs, including $49 million to 4  homeland defense programs, $91 million to U.S. regional missile defense programs, $44 million to missile defense testing efforts, and $140 million to missile defense advanced technology programs.  These programs are required to improve the reliability of missile defense system and ensure the United States stays ahead of the future ballistic missile threat.  Furthermore, the Administration opposes the addition of $455 million above the FY 2017 Budget request for Israeli missile defense procurement and cooperative development programs.   Coalition Support Fund (CSF).  The Administration objects to section 9020 of the bill, which would rescind funds available for CSF by $300 million.  Reducing CSF would limit DOD's ability to reimburse key allies in the fight against ISIL and other extremist groups in the region.  The rescission is especially harmful because it would reduce funds available for programs that are already underway and would limit DOD's flexibility to continue to program these funds for critical needs.  The Administration urges the Congress to retain the authority to make certain funds available to support stability activities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas as provided in section 1212(f) of the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act.  Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF).  The Administration objects to the reduction of $250 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for CTPF because it would restrict the resources required to empower and enable partners in responding to shared terrorist threats around the world.  The Administration also objects to the $200 million rescission in FY 2016 CTPF resources in the bill.  Both of these reductions would preclude DOD from continuing important security assistance programs begun in FY 2016.  The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to provide the $1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2017 and restore the rescinded FY 2016 funding.  Elimination of Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF) Funding.  The Administration objects to the elimination of the $99 million JUONF base funding requested in the FY 2017 Budget.  This funding is vital to the Department's ability to quickly respond to urgent operational needs.  Eliminating this funding may increase life-threatening risks to servicemembers and contribute to critical mission failures.  Rapid Prototyping, Experimentation and Demonstration.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $42 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for the Navy's research and development funding to support the Rapid Prototyping, Experimentation and Demonstration (RPED) initiative.  RPED is an essential element in the Navy's strategy to employ successful innovation technologies to help pace the dynamic threat of our adversaries, more quickly address urgent capability needs, accelerate our speed of innovation, and rapidly develop and deliver advanced warfighting capability to naval forces.  This reduction would render the initiative ineffective in promoting rapid acquisition, hindering the Navy's ability to determine the technical feasibility and operational utility of advanced technologies before committing billions of dollars toward development.  This reduction hinders the Department-wide goal of employing new techniques to make the acquisition process more agile and efficient.  Innovation and Access to Non-Traditional Suppliers.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $30 million for programs that seek to broaden DOD's access to innovative companies and technologies.  Specifically, the Administration is concerned about the elimination of the investment funding associated with the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx), as well as the reduction in funding for In-Q-Tel's efforts to explore innovative technologies that enable the efficient incorporation into weapons systems and operations capabilities.  These 5  investments would enable the development of leading-edge, primarily asymmetric capabilities and help spur development of new ways of warfighting to counter advanced adversaries.  Reduction of Funds for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Situational Awareness System.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $27 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for the development of a CWMD situational awareness information system, known as \"Constellation.\"  The Department is developing and fielding this system in response to requirements articulated by all Combatant Commands and validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council.  This capability is critical to anticipating WMD threats from both nation-state and non-state actors and sharing information between DOD and its U.S. interagency and international partners.  Funds were appropriated in FY 2014-2016 specifically to develop and field the Constellation system, which would be deployed in July 2016 as an initial prototype.  A reduction of $27 million would effectively terminate this initiative and prevent DOD from developing a high priority capability needed to counter WMD threats.  Navy High Energy Lasers.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $20 million from the FY 2017 Budget request for the Power Projection Advanced Technology program, which would delay by one year fielding of the High Energy Laser (HEL) program laser and demonstration of its technology maturation.  The HEL technology is a means of countering low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles and small surface vessels.  Limitation on Intelligence Community General Transfer Authority (GTA).  The Administration objects to section 8096 of the bill, which reduces the Intelligence Community's (IC's) FY 2016 enacted GTA cap from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion for FY 2017.  This proposed cap would place severe limits on the IC's flexibility to manage resources and could compromise the ability to meet critical intelligence priorities at a time of shifting and dynamic worldwide threats, especially in urgent circumstances.  This flexibility is especially important given the broad applicability of the GTA constraints to the appropriation accounts that fund IC.  Availability of Funds for Improvement of IC Financial Management.  The Administration objects to section 8066 of the bill, which places limits on the ability of IC to review and take action on financial management improvement measures.  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and DOD are engaged in a comprehensive review of financial management practices that may result in recommendations for changes to financial management or appropriations structures.  Constitutional Concerns  Several other provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 8055, 8071, 8121, and provisions under the headings \"Operations and Maintenance\u2014Defense-wide\" and \"Joint Improvised Threat Defeat Fund\" may interfere with the President's authority as Commander in Chief.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *   6  ", "The Administration is committed to taking responsible steps to modernize the Nation's energy infrastructure in a way that addresses climate change, promotes clean energy and energy efficiency, drives innovation, and ensures a cleaner, more stable environment for future generations.  The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 8 because it would undermine already successful initiatives designed to modernize the Nation's energy infrastructure and increase our energy efficiency.   Increased energy efficiency offers savings on energy bills, provides opportunities for more jobs, and improves industrial competitiveness.  H.R. 8 would stifle the Nation's move toward energy efficiency by severely hampering the Department of Energy's (DOE) ability to provide technical support for building code development and State implementation.  In addition, the bill would undercut DOE's ability to enforce its appliance standards and would weaken section 433 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which requires a reduction in fossil fuel-generated energy in Federal buildings.  H.R. 8 includes a provision regarding certain operational characteristics in capacity markets operated by Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs).  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and RTOs and ISOs are already well positioned, especially as technologies change over time, to ensure that capacity market structures adequately provide for the procurement of sufficient capacity to efficiently and reliably fulfill the resource-adequacy function that these markets are intended to perform.  H.R. 8 includes new, unnecessary provisions that would broaden FERC's authority to impose deadlines on other Federal agencies reviewing the environmental implications of natural gas pipeline applications.  H.R. 8 also would unnecessarily curtail DOE's ability to fully consider whether natural gas export projects are consistent with the public interest.    Further, H.R. 8 would undermine the current hydropower licensing regulatory process in place under the Federal Power Act that works to minimize negative impacts associated with the siting of hydropower projects, including negative impacts on safety, fish and wildlife, water quality and conservation, and a range of additional natural resources and cultural values.  Among the ways that H.R. 8 would undermine this process would be by creating a new exemption from licensing that would undercut bedrock environmental statutes, including the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Endangered Species Act.   Finally, H.R. 8 presents certain constitutional concerns.  Sections 1104 and 3004 would impermissibly interfere with the President's authorities with regard to the conduct of diplomacy and in some cases diplomatic communications, and sections 1109 and 1201 raise concerns under  the Recommendations Clause.  If the President were presented with H.R 8, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5931, which is an ill-advised attempt to respond to a problem \u2013 so-called \"ransom\" payments to Iran \u2013 that does not exist, in a way that would undermine U.S. obligations and ultimately benefit Iran at the expense of the United States.  The bill purports to raise concerns about the announcement in January that the United States brought home several unjustly detained Americans from Iran.  As the Administration has repeatedly made clear, Iran released several detained Americans, and the United States provided relief to certain Iranian citizens charged with primarily sanctions-related offenses, several of whom are dual U.S.-Iranian nationals, in a one-time, reciprocal humanitarian gesture that brought our Americans home after 14 months of intensive negotiations.  As the President has affirmed, the United States did not pay ransom to secure the return of our Americans from Iran.  As was also announced publicly in January, the United States transferred funds to Iran to effectuate the settlement of a long-standing claim at the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal at The Hague (the Tribunal).  The settlement of this 35-year old claim was resolved to the benefit of the U.S. taxpayer.  The timing of the settlement was a consequence of the United States taking advantage of the opening of diplomatic opportunities with Iran on several fronts simultaneously, including Implementation Day of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the intensification of negotiations to release unjustly detained Americans.  Both of these diplomatic achievements and the settlement of the Tribunal claim were made possible by this intensified engagement \u2013 all three were resolved on their own merits and were profoundly in the U.S. interest.  This bill, while styled as prohibiting future purported \"ransom payments,\" instead bars virtually any payment from the U.S. Government to Iran, including those permitted or even required by law.  Specifically, this bill would effectively prevent the United States from paying out awards rendered by the Tribunal and, thus, risk putting the United States in violation of our obligations under the Algiers Accords \u2013 an agreement concluded by President Carter, endorsed by President Reagan and honored by every President since that time.  Since the establishment of the Tribunal in 1981, the Tribunal has resolved numerous substantial claims of U.S. nationals against Iran, with over $2.5 billion being paid out to the U.S. claimants.  Further, this bill could effectively remove the President's ability to settle Tribunal claims with Iran for the foreseeable and indefinite future by requiring unrealistic certifications and notifications.  This is an unprecedented restriction on the President's claims settlement authority that would adversely affect our ability to resolve Tribunal claims on favorable terms to the U.S. taxpayer, as we did in January.  It would be unprecedented for the Congress to impose rigid, ex ante conditions on the President's prerogative to settle claims with foreign sovereigns.  This bill would benefit Iran, not the United States.  Settlements of Tribunal claims, over several decades, have already saved the U.S. taxpayers potentially billions of dollars.  Removing the  President's authority to settle these claims virtually guarantees higher monetary awards for Iran after years of continued litigation \u2013 and the U.S. taxpayers will be stuck with the bill.   The bottom line is that this bill is a short-sighted response to politicized discussions about the recent Tribunal settlement.  It undermines our international obligations in an unprecedented fashion that, ultimately, advantages Iran at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer.     If the President were presented with H.R. 5931, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration appreciates the bipartisan support for addressing key energy and conservation priorities in S. 2012.  Modernizing the Nation's energy system and the policies that govern it has been a central focus of the Administration's efforts to combat climate change, strengthen energy security and resilience, and enhance our economic competitiveness.  Through investments in research, development, and deployment; fuel economy standards; the President's Climate Action Plan; the Clean Power Plan; the Quadrennial Energy Review; and other initiatives, the Administration has made considerable progress in advancing cleaner energy systems that continue to deliver reliable and affordable energy for American homes and businesses.   S. 2012 would focus on energy efficiency, energy infrastructure, energy supply, and conservation.  The Administration believes that these are important issues and supports some provisions of the legislation.  In particular, the bill would benefit conservation by permanently reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Historic Preservation Fund, and by creating a new Park Maintenance and Revitalization Fund to help address the maintenance backlog at our National Parks.  In addition, the bill would address several key energy priorities.  It would reauthorize the weatherization assistance and State energy programs, support geothermal energy development, and advance energy job training, all of which support the President's Climate Action Plan.   However, the Administration has concerns with other parts of the legislation including provisions that would: generate budgetary scoring issues associated with energy savings contracts, which represent an important tool in advancing Federal sustainability; repeal existing Department of Energy (DOE) programs that aim to improve efficiency at manufacturing facilities; eliminate DOE oversight of certain technology demonstration and commercial activity at National Laboratories; eliminate independent certification requirements for certain ENERGY STAR products; potentially delay issuance of final rules by unnecessarily requiring Federal agencies to respond to reliability analyses already required under Executive Order 13211; omit key security considerations with regard to provisions dealing with cybersecurity and computing; create permitting processes and governance structures for certain energy infrastructure projects that are redundant or inconsistent with recently enacted law; and limit project reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act.  The Administration appreciates the role that carbon-free hydropower plays in meeting the Nation's energy needs.  S. 2012 would improve upon the hydropower relicensing provision contained in H.R. 8, but the Administration has concerns about its implementability.     The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns as the bill moves through the legislative process.   * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 1206, the No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act; H.R. 4890, the IRS Bonuses Tied to Measurable Metrics Act; and H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2015.  These bills would impose unnecessary constraints on the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) operations without improving the agency's ability to administer the tax code and serve taxpayers.  H.R. 1206 would prohibit the IRS from hiring any new employees until the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that no IRS employee has a seriously delinquent debt, or provides a report to the Congress that includes an explanation of why certification is not possible and what would be required to provide such a certification. The bill could result in the IRS being prohibited from hiring any new employees for any purpose \u2013 a drastic and counterproductive step that would compromise tax administration and taxpayer services.  The bill is also unworkable in operation, as \"seriously delinquent\" debts could be as low as $1 and tax liens are recorded on a case-by-case basis.  This legislation is unnecessary, as strong laws and procedures already exist to ensure that IRS employees comply with their tax obligations.  Publicly-available data show that IRS employees are among the most tax compliant groups in the Nation with a delinquency rate of less than 1 percent.    H.R. 4890 would ban performance awards to IRS employees until the Secretary of the Treasury develops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy.  This bill is unnecessary, as the IRS has already developed and has begun to execute a strategy to improve taxpayer services.  The real constraint on the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers effectively is severe underfunding, including for taxpayer services.  IRS funding is more than $900 million below its 2010 level, before adjusting for inflation.  These budget cuts have impeded the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers, including inadequate responses to taxpayer calls and correspondence.  Filing season statistics show that taxpayer service has improved this year as a result of a small funding increase provided last year, but more resources are needed to serve all taxpayers effectively and efficiently.  Legislation constraining the IRS's ability to retain and recruit highly qualified employees is not needed and could be counterproductive to the Service's mission.  H.R. 3724 would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily separated due to misconduct.  The bill as written could force the immediate termination of employees who had been terminated and rehired many years ago, even if their performance since rehiring has been blemish-free.  The bill's prohibition is also unnecessary because current IRS processes  already ensure the agency does not rehire former employees who had significant conduct or performance problems during prior employment with the agency.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee's continued support of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017.  However, the Administration strongly objects to many provisions in this bill that impede the Administration's ability to carry out the President's defense strategy.  H.R. 4909 fails to provide our troops with the resources they need to keep our Nation safe.  Instead of fully funding wartime operations such as INHERENT RESOLVE to defeat ISIL, the bill would redirect $18 billion of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds toward base budget programs that the Department of Defense (DOD) did not request, cutting off critical funding for wartime operations after April 30, 2017.  Not only is this approach dangerous, but it is also wasteful.  The bill would buy excess force structure without the money to sustain it, effectively creating hollow force structure that would undermine DOD's efforts to restore readiness.  Furthermore, the bill's funding approach attempts to unravel the dollar-for-dollar balance of defense and non-defense funding increases provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2015, threatening future steps needed to reverse over $100 billion of future sequestration cuts to DOD.  By gambling with warfighting funds, the bill risks the safety of our men and women fighting to keep America safe, undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles our allies, and emboldens our enemies.  In addition, H.R. 4909 would impose other unneeded costs, constraining DOD's ability to balance military capability, capacity, and readiness.  The President's defense strategy depends on investing every dollar where it will have the greatest effect.  The Administration's FY 2017 proposals will accomplish this by continuing and expanding critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, balance growth in compensation, modernize military health care, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The bill fails to adopt many of these reforms, including failing to authorize a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.    The bill also continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay, would prevent the United States from fulfilling its obligations under a treaty, and includes non-germane policy riders, such as those undermining the Endangered Species Act as well as public land management statutes, and those that would make it easier to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, which have nothing to do with national defense.    If the President were presented with H.R. 4909, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below, and urges the Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to make necessary changes to the bill.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the bill's classified annex and working with the Committee to address any concerns on classified programs.   Reduction, Expiration, and Misuse of OCO Funds:  The Administration strongly objects to the bill's proposal to substitute $18 billion of the Department's OCO request with $18 billion of unsustainable base budget programs that do not reflect the Department's highest joint priorities.  This approach creates a hollow force structure and risks the loss of funding for critical overseas contingency operations.  This gimmick is inconsistent with the BBA, which provided equal increases for defense and non-defense spending as well as the certainty needed to prosecute the counter-ISIL campaign, protect readiness recovery, modernize the force for future conflicts, and keep faith with service members and their families.    Provisions in the bill that would cause OCO funds in military personnel, operation and maintenance, defense health program, and working capital funds accounts to expire on April 30, 2017 are unacceptable.  Shortchanging wartime operations by $18 billion and cutting off funding in the middle of the year introduces a dangerous level of uncertainty for our men and women in uniform carrying out missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere.  Our troops need and deserve guaranteed, predictable support as they execute their missions year round, particularly in light of the dangers they face in executing the country's ongoing overseas contingency operations.  Counter Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Efforts:  The Administration strongly objects to the bill's proposal to cut OCO funding for U.S. efforts to counter ISIL and to prevent the availability of critical counter-ISIL funds after April 2017.  Reducing funding for train and equip activities in Iraq and Syria and cutting off funding mid-year would inhibit the U.S. military's ability to work with the Government of Iraq (GoI), the Syrian opposition, and other local forces to combat ISIL; interrupt ongoing U.S. support for forces on the ground in the middle of the year; and call into question the reliability of the U.S. commitment to support its partners.   The Administration also strongly objects to provisions in sections 1221 and 1222, which would further hamper the United States' ability to counter ISIL.  A unified Iraq led by a multisectarian government is a U.S. national security interest, but the bill's approach for supporting the Kurdish forces contradicts stated U.S. policy of countering ISIL \"by, with, and through\" the GoI.  Current policy has not inhibited U.S. support to Kurdish or Sunni forces, who with the Iraqi Army have reclaimed territory from ISIL control.  In addition, the requirement that not more than 75 percent of the authorized funds under section 1222 may be obligated or expended until after the Secretaries of Defense and State submit a plan to the Congressional Committees to retake and hold Mosul limits the U.S. ability to respond to evolving needs of Iraqi forces as necessary to successfully support their campaign against ISIL.  Finally, the expansion of a Secretary of Defense reprogramming certification requirement in section 1221 would add unnecessary bureaucracy, hamper the Department's ability to support the warfighter in a timely and flexible manner, and risk jeopardizing acceleration and effectiveness of the counter-ISIL campaign in Syria.  Guantanamo Detainee Provisions:  The Administration strongly objects to several provisions of the bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  As the Administration has 2  said many times before, operating this facility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  In February, the Administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter of our history to a close.  Rather than taking steps to close the facility, this bill aims to extend its operation.  Sections 1032 and 1033 would continue to prohibit the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States or even to construct or modify any facility in the United States to house detainees.  These restrictions would limit the ability of the Executive Branch to take the steps necessary to develop alternative locations for a detention facility, and from fulfilling its commitment to close the facility at Guantanamo.  The bill would also leave in place onerous restrictions on the transfer of detainees to foreign countries, and section 1034 would, in some cases, seek to prohibit certain transfers entirely.  The President has objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation.  These restrictions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests, and when and where to transfer them consistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy.  Sections 1032 and 1034 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation of powers principles, and section 1034 could in some circumstances interfere with the ability to transfer a detainee who has been granted a writ of habeas corpus.  Military End Strength:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 401 and 411, which would establish end strength levels above the President's Budget request for Active and Reserve Forces as of September 30, 2017.  These provisions would force the Department to take additional risk in training and readiness of the current force, as well as investment in and procurement of future capabilities.  In addition, the Administration objects to section 402, which would establish a new minimum active-duty end strength for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force as of September 30, 2017.  Adding unnecessary end strength in the manner proposed in the bill would invite a significant, unacceptable risk of creating a future hollow force, in which force structure exists, but the resources to make it ready do not follow.  The Administration urges support of the Department's plan, which reflects sound strategy and responsible choices among capacity, capabilities, and current and future readiness.   TRICARE Reform:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the transition to two TRICARE programs, TRICARE Prime and Preferred.  However, sections 701 and 704 would eliminate almost all of the savings ($200 million in FY 2017 and $7 billion through FY 2021) contained in the Administration's proposal and instead add almost $1 billion in costs to the Defense Health Program.  It also creates a complex system of separate benefits for members and retirees based on their dates of initial entry into military service.  Further, the proposed pharmacy co-pay adjustments and reasonable enrollment fee for TRICARE for Life participants were rejected.  The Administration believes strongly that the President's FY 2017 Military Health System (MHS) benefit reform package represents a reasonable and financially sound proposal for our beneficiaries.  We look forward to working with the Congress on needed TRICARE reforms as part of a comprehensive package of MHS reforms.  Modifications to the Newly-Created Military Retirement System:  The Administration appreciates the flexibility provided by section 622 and urges the Congress to support the use of continuation pay for service members with up to 16 years of service, given varying retention rates across career fields and the military departments.  However, the Administration is 3  concerned about mandating a 2.5 monthly basic pay multiplier for continuation pay for all members.  Allowing DOD greater flexibility to adjust the timing and amount of continuation pay would allow military services to shape the force more effectively and efficiently.   Military Pay Raise:  The Administration objects to section 601.  This section places restrictions on the President's authority to set an alternative pay adjustment for members of the uniformed services at 1.6 percent basic pay, which would save $336 million in FY 2017 and $2.2 billion through FY 2021.  The President's FY 2017 pay proposal would allow the Department to achieve a proper balance between DOD's obligation to provide competitive pay to service members and its responsibility to provide troops the finest training and equipment possible.  Prohibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Round:   The Administration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can make better use of scarce resources.  In addition to addressing every previous Congressional objection to BRAC authorization, the Department recently conducted a DOD-wide parametric capacity analysis which demonstrates that the Department has 22 percent excess capacity.  Additionally, the Administration's BRAC legislative proposal includes several changes that respond to Congressional concerns regarding cost.  Specifically, the revised BRAC legislation requires the Secretary to certify that BRAC will have the primary objective of eliminating excess capacity and reducing costs; emphasizes recommendations that yield net savings within five years (subject to military value); and limits recommendations that take longer than 20 years to pay back.     Rocket Propulsion System Development Program:  The Administration appreciates the amended language to section 1608 of the FY 2015 NDAA to authorize up to 18 RD-180 engines, ensuring a necessary and cost-effective bridge to American-made launch services.  However, the Administration strongly objects to section 1601, which would place restrictions on the funds to eliminate the Nation's use of these engines for national security space launches.  The Committee's approach overemphasizes one component of a launch vehicle and, in doing so, risks the successful and timely fielding of new domestic launch systems.  The Administration is committed to developing new American-made propulsion systems as part of these new launch vehicles, but this should be done in accordance with well-accepted systems engineering principles and not arbitrary funding allocations.    The Administration also strongly objects to the direction in section 1601 requiring the acquisition of Government purpose rights and technical data for any new rocket propulsion system.  Complying with this direction is not feasible as it would likely require re-negotiation of the current development contracts, thereby delaying the delivery of the new domestic capabilities beyond 2019.  Pursuing such robust data rights would also undermine the very nature of the public-private partnerships, require significantly more Government funding, and risk further industry investment and participation.  The Administration's public-private partnerships are successfully leveraging willing private investment to develop commercially viable launch vehicles, and this has already saved taxpayers nearly $200 million, while maintaining access to the data that the Government needs.  These partnerships could save taxpayers more than $500 million through 2019 and deliver valuable capabilities for the Nation and benefits to our economy faster than the Committee's approach.   Availability of Funds for Retirement or Inactivation of Ticonderoga-Class Cruisers or Dock Landing Ships:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1024, which would prohibit 4  obligating or expending FY 2017 funds to retire, prepare to retire, inactivate, or place in storage more than six cruisers and one dock landing ship.  This provision would prevent the Navy from executing its phased modernization approach for maintaining an effective cruiser and dock landing ship force structure while balancing scarce operations and maintenance funding.  It also would significantly reduce planned savings, accelerate the retirement of all Ticonderoga-Class cruisers, and create obsolescence of Air Defense Commander platforms resulting in a significant surface combatant shortfall in 2030.  When compared to the cruiser phased modernization plan proposed in the FY 2017 President's Budget, the proposed language of this section would require an additional $3.2 billion across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) to fund manpower, maintenance, modernization, and operations.    In addition, the prohibition on obligating more than 75 percent of funds made available for the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) until the Secretary of the Navy enters into ship modernization contracts would require significant reductions in manpower over and above the 25 percent reduction planned in the FY 2017 President's Budget for OSD, as well as curtailed spending for joint force readiness programs such as the Commanders Exercise and Engagement Training Transformation and the Readiness and Environment Protection Integration Program.  Littoral Combat Ships (LCS): The Administration strongly objects to the bill's proposal to increase the purchase of LCS in FY 2017 from two to three as noted in the table supporting Section 4013, Shipbuilding and Conversion line number 11.  The Administration reduced from 52 to 40 the total number of LCS and Frigates (FF) the Navy will purchase over the life of the program. A combined 40 LCS and FF will allow for the Department to invest in advanced capabilities across the fleet and will provide sufficient capacity to meet the Department's warfighting needs and to exceed recent presence levels with a more modern and capable ship than legacy mine sweepers, frigates, and coastal patrol craft they will replace.  By funding two LCS in FY 2017, the President's Budget ensures that both shipyards are on equal footing and have robust production leading up to the competition to select the shipyard that will continue the program.  Both LCS yards will remain active for five or more years.  This competitive environment ensures the best price for the taxpayer on the remaining ships, while also achieving savings by down-selecting to one shipyard.  The bill prevents the use of resources for higher priorities to improve the Department's warfighting capability, like undersea, other surface, and aviation investments.  Coalition Support Fund (CSF):  The Administration objects to section 1212, which would make $450 million of CSF to Pakistan ineligible for the Secretary of Defense's waiver authority unless the Secretary provides a certification to the Congressional defense committees.  We share the Committee's concerns regarding the threat posed to our forces and interests in Afghanistan by the Haqqani Network, and we continue to engage with Pakistan at the highest levels regarding the need for concerted action specifically against the group.  However, the restriction in section 1212 would unnecessarily complicate progress in our bilateral relationship on this issue and would limit the Secretary of Defense's ability to act in the U.S. national security interest.  The Administration is also disappointed that the committee did not modify CSF authority to allow DOD to reimburse coalition nations that support U.S. efforts in Afghanistan and to counter the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, as requested.  This limitation could hamper the United States' ability to counter terrorists and to support our allies in the region, including partners who have the capability to perform the Counter-ISIL mission, but who lack the funds to pay for a deployment and sustainment of operations in Iraq or Syria.  Lastly, the Department asks the 5  Congress to retain the authority to make certain funds available to support stability activities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas as provided in section 1212(f) of the FY 2016 NDAA.    Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF):  The Administration objects to the reduction of $250 million of CTPF in section 1510 because it would limit a valuable partnership-focused approach to counterterrorism.  Reducing CTPF precludes DOD from continuing important security assistance programs begun in FY 2016. The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to authorize the $1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2017.   Reduction in the Number of Navy Carrier Air Wings:  The Administration objects to Carrier Air Wing Restoration in section 4303.  The elimination of the tenth Carrier Air Wing proposed in the FY 2017 President's Budget optimizes Carrier Air Wing force structure to meet Global Force Management Allocation Plan demand, sustains the health and wholeness of Naval Aviation, and generates $926 million in FYDP savings.  Additionally, if forced to retain the tenth Carrier Air Wing, the Navy would require an additional $48 million in FY 2017 for military personnel and an additional increase of 1,167 in end strength above the objectionable end strength increase already in the bill.    Joint Intelligence Analysis Complex (JIAC):  The Administration strongly objects to the bill's omission from section 2301(b) of authorization for expending funds associated with the $53.1 million needed for  phase three (of three) of construction of the JIAC at Royal Air Force (RAF) Croughton, United Kingdom.  This important project recapitalizes critically deficient facilities by consolidating and relocating RAF Molesworth operations and missions in support of United States European Command (USEUCOM), United States Africa Command (USAFRICOM), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  The Administration also strongly objects to section 1623, which would restrict the Department's hiring of critically-needed intelligence professionals specializing in Russia at a time when the Russian threat to the United States and our European allies is increasing and requires redoubled intelligence collaboration.  In March 2016, pursuant to requirements in the FY 2016 NDAA, the FY 2016 Intelligence Authorization Act, and the FY 2016 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, the Department certified that RAF Croughton remains the optimal location for recapitalization of the JIAC, that Lajes Air Field in Portugal is not an optimal location for the JIAC, and there are no alternative uses for Lajes Air Field.  Delays in the JIAC project jeopardize $74 million in annual savings that will be achieved once RAF Molesworth and RAF Alconbury, which currently host and support the USEUCOM/USAFRICOM/NATO intelligence mission, are able to close as scheduled.    Alternative Fuels:  The Administration strongly objects to section 311, which would dilute the public policy established by section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (contracting requirements for alternative or synthetic fuel) -- a law passed with strong bipartisan support that provides a sound framework for the development of future alternative fuels.  A diverse approach to energy security, one that includes both conventional and new sources, will benefit the economy and enhance our military capability.  Limitation on Availability of Funds for Acceleration of Nuclear Weapons Dismantlement:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3118 which puts unnecessary restrictions on the ability of the President to exercise his responsibilities to manage the nuclear arsenal.  The Administration also strongly objects to the reduction in funding for accelerated dismantlement of retired nuclear warheads.  The United States has a considerable backlog of retired warheads 6  awaiting dismantlement that are no longer needed for military purposes.  Funding for accelerated dismantlement is important both to appropriately manage the U.S. nuclear arsenal in a safe and effective way and to demonstrate continued U.S. commitment to our nonproliferation and disarmament commitments.  Undermining Federal Oversight:  The bill would hinder the effective oversight of critical nuclear security, safety, and environmental management programs, including: weapons modernization, nuclear nonproliferation, physical and cyber security, as well as cleanup and project management activities.  Section 3116 and section 3117 would limit expenditures for salaries and program direction until the Secretary of Energy submits specific plans to Congress. These restrictions, coupled with authorized funding levels $40 million below the President's request for National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) staffing, threaten the ability of the Department of Energy to recruit, maintain and train Federal staff to oversee the management of the nuclear security enterprise and the legacy of waste and contamination from nuclear weapons production.  Relative to 2011, NNSA's workforce is 17 percent smaller despite an 18 percent increase in program funding.  One measure of this imbalance of staffing-to-workload relates to the acquisition workforce.  For NNSA, each Federal acquisition professional manages an average of $116 million of program dollars compared to the Government average of $10.7 million.  The Administration is concerned about section 3117, which would hold back 10 percent of program direction funds within the defense environmental cleanup program as a penalty until the submission of a report that presupposes the President's Budget request for future years. This provision infringes upon the Department's ability to manage its Federal workforce by arbitrarily limiting the expending of program direction funds that are used to pay salaries of workers who provide critically important Federal oversight at environmental cleanup sites across the country.  Prohibition on Availability of Funds for Provision of Certain Assistance to Russian Federation:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3115, which would prohibit the use of funds for nuclear security activities in Russia unless the activities are \"new and emergency\" in nature, and unless the Department certifies that it has no backlog of deferred maintenance to physical security equipment and its own defense nuclear facilities.  Effectively a blanket prohibition on nuclear security cooperation with Russia, this provision would prevent the United States from addressing nuclear security concerns by improving physical security at certain Russian nuclear sites, which is an essential element of U.S. global efforts to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism.  Nonproliferation Construction Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility:  The Administration appreciates the provisional flexibility in section 3113 to terminate the MOX approach to plutonium disposition, once certain conditions are met.  However, the Administration objects to a delay in funding the alternative plutonium disposition option and the effort to require continued construction in support of the MOX approach.  Continuing construction, even temporarily, will result in additional millions of dollars being wasted rather than being directed to the alternative disposition method.  The already-proven alternative method of disposition is expected to be significantly faster and less expensive than the MOX approach and has far lower risks.  Another important consideration is that the alternative to MOX would likely enable the United States to remove plutonium from South Carolina decades sooner than MOX could.    7  Non-applicability of Certain Executive Orders to DOD and NNSA:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1095, which would roll back important safeguards established by the President to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not reward corporations that break labor laws and thereby jeopardize the performance and cost of Federal contracting.  These safeguards give Federal contracting officers the information they need to assess a contractor's record of integrity and assist contractors with significant labor violations in improving their labor law compliance.  In doing so, these protections help ensure that law-abiding contractors do not have to compete with those who offer lower bids based on savings from skirting the law.  The Administration is committed to working with contractors who invest in their workers' safety and maintain a fair and equitable workplace, and section 1095 would impede efforts that will bring efficiencies and cost savings to the Federal Government.  Missile Defense Programs:  While appreciating the Committee's support of DOD's ballistic missile defense programs, the Administration strongly objects to section 1656, which would require the initiation of concept definition, design, research, development, and engineering evaluation and testing for a space-based intercept and defeat layer and space test bed.  There currently is no requirement for a space-based intercept and there are concerns about the technical feasibility and long-term affordability of interceptors in space.  In addition, the Administration objects to section 1663, which would direct the Director of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to issue a request for proposal to procure a medium-range discrimination radar or equivalent sensor for the defense of Hawaii.  DOD is conducting a study to determine the appropriate balance of sensors and locations to best defend the homeland, including Hawaii; it will be completed in the fourth quarter of FY 2016.  Section 1663 could limit the Administration's ability to defend the entire homeland and the flexibility to apply the best capabilities to address rapidly evolving threats.   Limitation on Availability of Funds for Patriot Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Capability of the Army:  The Administration objects to section 1658, which would infringe on the authority of the Secretary of the Army to set forth, approve, and execute requirements.  It also would limit the Army's flexibility to trade cost and performance with schedule to ensure a system is fielded that meets requirements.    Prohibition on Availability of Funds for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction System (CWMD) Constellation:  The Administration objects to section 216, which would prohibit the obligation and expenditure of any funds in FY 2017 for research, development, and prototyping of the CWMD situational awareness information system known as \"Constellation.\"  DOD is developing and fielding a CWMD situational awareness system in response to requirements articulated by all combatant commands and validated by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council.  This capability is critical to anticipating weapons of mass destruction threats from nation-state and non-state actors and sharing information between DOD and its U.S. interagency and international partners.  The Constellation system will be deployed in July 2016 as a development prototype.  Prohibiting use of FY 2017 funds effectively terminates this important initiative.   Defense Planning Guidance and Contingency Planning Guidance Information to Congress:  The Administration strongly objects to provisions of section 904, which would direct the Secretary of Defense to submit to the Congressional defense Committees copies and detailed summaries of classified aspects of defense planning guidance, raising constitutional concerns.  The defense planning guidance informs the Department's internal force planning, resourcing, and acquisition 8  processes, which collectively support the annual development and submission of the President's Budget.  Release of this guidance risks impairing the confidentiality of the Secretary's direction to Departmental Components, which contain sensitive national security information protected by executive privilege, and which directly informs both the development of Components' Program Objective Memorandums and decisions affecting Departmental programs in the Program and Budget Review process.  Regarding contingency planning, information about potential future military operations used in the preparation of contingency plans is limited even within the Department to those individuals having a mission-critical role in the production, review, or execution of those plans or operations.  Release of this information would interfere with the prerogative of the President and the Secretary of Defense to communicate direction to subordinate military commanders containing sensitive national security information that is protected by executive privilege.  In addition, the required inclusion in the guidance of \"any additional or alternative views of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including any military assessment of risks associated with the defense strategy,\" risks impairment of the Department's programs by compromising the candor and confidentiality of pre-decisional advice given to the Secretary of Defense and the President.    Role of Military Medical Treatment Facilities and Changes in Their Management:  The Administration objects to provisions in sections 702 and 703.  Section 702 realigns the management of Service military treatment facilities (MTFs) to the Director, Defense Health Agency (DHA).  This section raises serious concerns regarding reporting chains to Service commands and DHA.  While this proposal seeks to gain standardization by centralizing decision authority, the integration of the Services' MTF operating systems under the DHA would incur very high costs and would compromise the effectiveness of the MTFs as readiness platforms supporting the operational warfighter.  Section 703 defines criteria for MTF types based on the availability of civilian health care in the surrounding geographical areas without regard to the readiness requirements of military medical providers.  Both of these provisions raise serious concerns about the interplay between operational readiness requirements and health delivery.  The Department looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve comprehensive reform of the Military Health System that carefully considers all of these matters.   Military Response Options to Russian Federation Violation of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1232 which makes some DOD funding in support of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) contingent upon submission of a report by the Secretary of Defense.  DOD provides support to the EOP that is entirely unrelated to the INF Treaty, including the White House Military Office that provides direct support to the President for transportation, communications, and emergency medical services.  Limiting these funds will also have a negative impact on the ability of the EOP to manage and oversee vital national security defense policy development and implementation.    Open Skies Treaty:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1231, which would effectively prohibit the expenditure of funds pertaining to the Open Skies Treaty.  This would preclude U.S. participation in certification of Russian infra-red (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, which in turn would prevent the United States from objecting to the certification of these aircraft and sensors.  Meanwhile, other State Parties could certify a Russian aircraft equipped with IR and SAR sensors.  Section 1231 would also prohibit the expenditure of funds to accept an initial Russian observation flight equipped with IR and SAR sensors, preventing the United States from fulfilling its obligations under the Treaty, which was ratified by the President and for which the Senate provided its advice and overwhelming consent.  Also, the 14 day 9  reporting requirement imposed by the NDAA would be impossible to meet because treaty procedures allow 15 days for data processing to verify treaty compliance, and the Department would need additional time to transport and analyze the data.  New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty):  The Administration strongly objects to section 1645, which would make the obligation and expenditure of DOD funds to extend the New START Treaty dependent upon the submission of onerous and duplicative reporting on arms control and military balance issues.  This provision would impede the United States from exercising an existing right under the Treaty, which was ratified by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate in 2010.  With implementation of the Treaty well underway, a decision to extend the Treaty in order to constrain Russia's strategic nuclear forces for an additional five years rests with the President in his capacity as commander-in-chief.  In addition, section 1645 would require the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to report to Congress on the Treaty's national security value to the United States, a determination that should take into account the views of the entire Executive Branch, including the Intelligence Community (IC).  Similarly, this provision assigns to the Director of National Intelligence the sole responsibility to report on Russia's compliance with its arms control obligations. Section 403 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2593a), already requires a report by the President on Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments.  By Executive Order, the State Department produces and submits to Congress this report, in coordination with the Departments of Defense and Energy, as well as the IC.   Afghan Special Immigrant Visas (SIV):  The Administration objects to the lack of authorization in section 1216 for additional visas for the Afghan SIV program, which would enable Afghan nationals who have aided U.S. efforts through their work, and who experience an ongoing serious threat as a result, to apply for these visas.  Additional numbers will be necessary to issue visas to all qualified applicants under current law. Further, the Administration strongly objects to the proposed dramatic cut back in section 1216 of the scope of eligibility for Afghans who have worked for the U.S. Government other than supporting its military forces.  By narrowing eligibility, the program would erode the expectations of hundreds of Afghan staff whose lives remain in danger because of their work for the U.S. mission and also make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified Afghan staff who are essential to achieving our diplomatic and assistance goals.  Innovation and Access to Non-Traditional Suppliers:  The Administration objects to the authorization reduction and flexibility limitations in section 217 on programs that seek to broaden DOD's access to innovative companies and technologies.  Specifically, the Administration is concerned with the complete elimination of the investment funding associated with the Defense Innovation Unit Experiment, as well as the reduction in funding for the Strategic Capabilities Office and In-Q-Tel's efforts to explore innovative technologies that enable the efficient incorporation into weapons systems and operations capabilities.  While relatively modest compared to the Department's overall budget, these investments will enable the development of leading-edge, primarily asymmetric capabilities and help spur development of new ways of warfighting to counter advanced adversaries. In order to sustain technological superiority, the Department must take advantage of the rapid evolution of emerging commercial technologies that, when integrated with military systems and novel concept of operations, will be a source of battlefield advantage.  10  Providing Footwear to Recruits at Initial Entry Training:  The Administration objects to section 808, which would require the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to provide athletic footwear directly to recruits upon their entry into the Armed Forces instead of providing a cash allowance for the purchase of such footwear, at the choice of the recruit.  Because it is likely that only one company could benefit disproportionately from such DOD purchasing requirements, this provision essentially serves as preferential arrangement for a particular company.  Mandating that a specific article of clothing be provided to new recruits is unprecedented and, in the case of athletic shoes, runs counter to research that indicates a strong correlation between the variety of athletic shoes available, fit, and comfort, and reduced injury rates.  Forcing DOD into a \"one size fits all\" approach to athletic footwear may contribute to a higher incidence of injury to new recruits during one of the most critical times in a member's military training.  DOD places the health of our service members above all other considerations.   Prohibition on Per Diem Allowance Reductions Based on the Duration of Temporary Duty Assignment or Civilian Travel:  The Administration objects to section 603, which would prohibit a reduced flat per diem rate for uniformed service members and DOD civilian employees who travel to one location for more than 30 days.  This prohibition, which applies only to the Department, is contrary to the growing Government-wide trend toward implementing flat rate per diem for long-term travel. Section 603 would nullify an evidence-based policy decision that compensates DOD travelers for the expenses incurred, demonstrates the Department's stewardship of taxpayer funds, and meets external mandates to simplify travel and reduce costs. The significant increased costs would negate annual programmed savings affecting force readiness and reduce the Department's ability to fully fund official travel by imposing an unfunded annual requirement on the military departments.  The prohibition would add $56 million or more annually to the Department's travel costs.   Clarification of Contracts Covered by Airlift Service Provision:  The Administration objects to section 1085, which would expand the definition of a \"contract for airlift service\" to include any DOD contract in which \"transportation services are used in the performance of the contract or any subcontract (at any tier).\"  Section 9516 of title 10, United States Code, requires DOD contracts for airlift services involving transportation by aircraft eligible for the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program to be awarded to air carriers in the program.  Section 1085 would significantly expand the range of contracts to which section 9516 applies and affect hundreds, if not thousands, of DOD contracts for supplies and services in which the use of air transportation is incidental to the performance of the contract or subcontracts at every tier.  This provision would provide little benefit to DOD, restrict the Department's operational flexibility, significantly increase costs to the taxpayer, and place impractical and unnecessary constraints on DOD contracts.   Plans on Transfer of Acquisition and Funding Authority of Certain Weather Missions to National Reconnaissance Office (NRO):  The Administration objects to section 1609, which would transfer acquisition and funding authority for some environmental monitoring missions from the Air Force to the NRO.  The DOD weather enterprise should be managed as an integrated mission.  The Air Force currently provides space-based environmental monitoring systems, services, and data products to support a large number of strategic and tactical users.  Section 1609 would make integrated sensor collection, mission management, data processing, and forecasting less efficient by segregating overlapping requirements across multiple organizations.  Managing the DOD weather enterprise as a whole is the most affordable and effective way to meet warfighter requirements within available resources.  There is currently no Air Force 11  investment funding for a cloud characterization and theater weather imagery system or capability that could be transferred to the NRO.   Hypersonic Boost Glide Vehicle Defense:  While appreciating the Committee's support to ensure defense against hypersonic boost glide vehicles, the Administration objects to section 1657, which would direct the Director of the MDA to establish a program of record.  This provision could limit the Administration's ability to establish the best Service or Agency to establish a program of record to defend against hypersonic boost glide vehicles.   Establishment of Unified Combatant Command for Cyber Operations:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for DOD's cyber mission and forces, but objects to statutorily requiring the establishment of a unified combatant command for cyber operations in section 911.  The Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff should retain the flexibility to recommend to the President changes to the unified command plan that they believe would most effectively organize the military to address an ever-evolving threat environment.   Restructuring of the Distributed Common Ground System of the Army (DCGS-A):  The Administration objects to section 219, which would restrict the development and integration of DCGS-A Increment 2 components where a commercial software is capable of fulfilling at least 80 percent of the component's requirement.  This provision is duplicative and unnecessary and mandates a commercial solution without regard for price, ability to support a modular open system architecture, or cost associated with proprietary software maintenance.  In practice, the provision could mandate acquisition of a system comprised of commercial products that do not fully meet required Key Performance Parameters without due consideration of integration costs and schedule impacts, putting the system's affordability, functionality, and interoperability at risk.   Consolidation of Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) Functions of the Air Force:  The Administration objects to section 1646, which would require the Air Force to consolidate NC3 under a single commander and include the Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) system as a part of NC3.  The Administration objects to the inclusion of ITW/AA within NC3 because it would fracture the space and missile-warning enterprise and adversely affect critical missile-warning and air defense operations.  Furthermore, the consolidation would violate Commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) authorities for executing NORAD's aerospace warning mission and, thus, would require revision of the U.S. bi-national agreement with Canada.  Also, the Air Force has already made significant progress towards consolidating the mission under a single commander (Commander of Air Force Global Strike Command).   Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF):  While the Administration appreciates the Committee expanding the authority to interdict improvised explosive device precursor chemicals in foreign countries of concern, section 1532 fails to address the successor fund to the JIEDDF mandated by the NDAA for FY 2016.  Without the authorization of the JIEDDF, the successor fund proposed by DOD, the Administration is constrained in its ability to rapidly respond to non-traditional, unanticipated improvised threats on the battlefield and to protect against the rapidly emerging improvised threats currently faced by U.S. forces.   12  Reduction in General Officer and Flag Officer Grades and Positions:  While the Administration supports simplifying and improving command and control of the military, particularly where the number of four-star positions have made headquarters either top-heavy or less efficient, it objects to section 910, which would limit the grade of service or functional component commanders of combatant commands to be no higher than lieutenant general or vice admiral, and reduce the total number of officers serving in the grade of general or admiral by five.  The Administration intends to reduce the number of four-star positions and across-the-board mandated reductions are unnecessary.     Restriction on the Application of the Prohibition on Performance of Non-Defense Audits by Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA):  The Administration strongly objects to section 840, which provides a limited roll-back of the prohibition on performance of non-defense audits by DCAA.  The Administration recommends simply rescinding the prohibition on performance of non-defense audits contained in section 893 of the FY 2016 NDAA.  Maintaining the current prohibition on performance of non-defense agencies by DCAA extends the length of time it would take DCAA to reduce its incurred cost backlog and creates additional burdens and audit inefficiencies on the audit process for both contractors and Government agencies.  The requirement in the Committee report for a comprehensive review by the Comptroller General of the United States of DCAA's current backlog is a more appropriate vehicle to identify potential remedies to address DCAA's incurred cost backlog.   Dual Status Military Technicians:  The Administration objects to section 514, which would exempt dual status military technicians from civilian employee furloughs.  Military technicians are civilian employees and should be treated in the same manner as all Federal civilian employees.  As civilian employees, there are civilian furlough exemptions allowed by statute that would permit certain technicians to continue working.  In addition, in the event of an emergency, these personnel could be activated, at which point they would convert to military status and would no longer be subject to furlough.  Unobligated Balances Reductions:  The Administration objects to the $2 billion reduction for unobligated balances across multiple appropriations.  For Operation and Maintenance appropriations, $1.1 billion of the reductions will only be applied to those programs funded in section 4301, which include the military services' readiness, depot maintenance, base operations support, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions will delay the Department's full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of maintenance at the services' depot facilities.  As part of the budget analysis, the Department reviewed the services' unobligated balances and realigned savings from historically underperforming accounts into readiness and operations accounts for FY 2017.  The remaining $200 million reduction for Operation and Maintenance unobligated balances will affect Army Operation and Maintenance programs funded in section 4302, which include contingency operations and reset.  This reduction will delay the Department's efforts to support ongoing overseas contingency operations and reset for equipment returning from theater.   National Biodefense Strategy:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1086 which would require the Secretaries of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Agriculture to jointly develop a biodefense strategy and an associated implementation plan.  The Executive Branch already works under several existing Presidential Policy Directives covering biodefense and these make section 1086 redundant.  Additionally, biodefense is a cross agency national security priority that needs to be coordinated by the EOP.  As such, the National 13  Security Council staff is currently working with all relevant departments and agencies to develop, coordinate, implement and review biodefense efforts. Implementing a new structure and process outside of the normal Executive Branch coordinating mechanism will lead to confusion, and may slow or reverse the strong progress the agencies have made in developing robust biodefense programs.    Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF):  The Administration objects to the elimination of its base funding JUONF request of $99.3 million.  This funding is vital to the Department's ability to quickly begin responding to urgent operational needs.  Eliminating this funding may increase life-threatening risks to service members and contribute to critical mission failures.   Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Reform:  The Administration appreciates that the bill adopts a number of the UCMJ reforms proposed by the Administration, including enhanced victims' rights (including anti-retaliatory measures), improvements to trial procedures, and updated sentencing guidelines.   Housing Unaccompanied Children:  The Administration strongly objects to section 2812, which would prohibit the use of a military installation located in the United States to house any unaccompanied child.  The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) is required by law to provide for the shelter, care, and placement of unaccompanied children referred to its custody. The number of children referred to ORR custody is difficult to predict and fluctuates throughout the year. As a result, ORR continually works to identify shelter options in the event of caseload increases, including space to temporarily house children when standard capacity is exceeded. These additional shelter options may include, but are not limited to, DOD facilities.  DOD assists with the identification of those sites to ensure that such use would not adversely impact DOD operations.  In addition, ORR reimburses DOD for the temporary use of DOD facilities and children are not cared for by DOD personnel. Given the unpredictability of flows in unaccompanied children arrivals, limiting the available shelter options would present serious difficulties for ORR contingency planning and would likely increase costs to U.S. taxpayers.  Personnel Provisions:  The Administration has concerns with section 1109, which would limit the period of time for which an employee of the Federal Government may be put on administrative leave.  The provision substantially limits Federal agencies' discretion, would be administratively burdensome, and, in many cases, would not allow time for the agency to thoroughly investigate and adjudicate issues in a legally defensible manner due to many factors.  Section 1109 could also pose safety and national security issues, as it would restrain an agency's use of administrative leave in conjunction with a proposed adverse action and where an agency believes the employee may otherwise pose a threat to safety and security in the workplace, or to the proper safeguarding of sensitive information or operations.  Further, for IC agencies, the requirement for notice to Congressional committees other than their authorizing committees could create unacceptable counterintelligence or security risks.  The Administration also has concerns with section 1110, which would require an agency head to make a permanent personnel file notation for an individual who resigns while under investigation if an adverse finding is made. This section would be difficult to implement because it is unclear what would be expected of an agency under these circumstances since they are often precluded from taking any disciplinary action against individuals who are no longer employed by the agency.  While section 1110 would provide for a process for notification and appeals, the process in and of itself would not correct the inherent flaw of placing a notation in an individual's official personnel file based 14  on what may be an incomplete investigation, and without a full determination by the agency that an adverse personnel action would have been warranted.    Small Business Set-Aside Threshold:  The Administration strongly opposes section 1804, which would synchronize the dollar amount of the statutory small business set-aside threshold in the Small Business Act to the level of the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT).  The Administration seeks to increase the SAT from its current level of $150,000 to $500,000 in order to make transacting with the Government easier and less costly for contractors, including many enterprising small businesses offering emerging technologies that can be used to fight cyber-attacks and support forward-leaning twenty-first century digital activities.   Despite the important benefits associated with raising the SAT, a parallel increase in the set-aside threshold could, by significantly reducing the value of procurements accessible to them, create friction with our trade agreement partners, who could seek to retaliate by reducing the ability of U.S. small businesses from competing for Government procurement contracts in their markets.  Small businesses already receive a significant portion of Federal contract work between $150,000 and $500,000 and do not require imposition of the statutory set-aside in order to effectively compete for and receive work from the Government under $500,000.  Exemptions to Civil Rights Laws:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1094, which would undermine important protections put in place by the President to ensure that Federal contractors and subcontractors do not engage in discriminatory employment practices.  This Administration is committed to promoting equal employment opportunities for all Americans regardless of who they are or who they love while at the same time preserving longstanding safeguards in the law for religious liberty, including the religious exemption codified in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  In authorizing certain Federal awardees to discriminate in Government-funded jobs, section 1094 represents a step in the wrong direction for our country that will keep qualified American workers from being able to hold jobs funded by the American people.   Supply of Specialty Motors from Certain Manufacturers:  The Administration objects to section 346 because this provision would erode energy and consumer cost savings from the final rule that amended the energy conservation standards for electric motors, undermine the Department of Energy's consensus agreement that involved a wide range of stakeholders in the rulemaking process, and exploit the loopholes that exist in the current regulations by allowing small businesses not to comply. This provision could harm domestic businesses and further complicate the market as cheap imports could also exploit this proposal.  Impairment of Endangered Species Act (ESA) Conservation and Public Land Management:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 2864 and 2865, which undermine State and Federal cooperative efforts to protect the Greater Sage Grouse and Lesser Prairie Chicken, as well as Section 2866, which removes the American Burying Beetle from the Endangered Species List. Section 2864 would effectively override longstanding principles of major Federal land management statutes, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the National Forest Management Act.  Congressionally-mandated removal from the Endangered Species List, delays in determining species status, and State control over Federal public lands undermine the science-based decision-making at the core of the ESA, are unnecessary for military readiness, and are ill-advised for purposes of public land management.  These provisions are non-germane to the NDAA, would impair the protection afforded by the ESA, and undermine years of collaborative conservation work with private landowners, States, and other stakeholders.  15  The National Historic Preservation Act:  The Administration objects to section 2855, which would amend the National Historic Preservation Act to allow Federal agencies to object to a designation of Federal properties for reasons of national security.  Listing a property on the National Register of Historic Places, or designating it as a National Historic Landmark, does not limit any Federal agency's decision-making authority.  Decisions on how to manage the property, informed by the evaluation of its significance and integrity, remain the responsibility of the agency with jurisdiction over that property.  The Administration is not aware of any specific instance where such a designation has adversely affected national security. Enactment of this section could lead to a fundamental weakening of highly successful and widely admired programs that Congress intended to help recognize and protect our shared heritage.  Military Land Withdrawals:  The Administration has concerns with sections 2841 and 2842 relating to military land withdrawals.  With regard to the provisions applicable to public lands, the responsible agencies will continue to coordinate to facilitate responsible use of public lands to support military readiness, training, and testing, acknowledging the current system of periodic legislative re-withdrawals is not particularly efficient and does not provide for the optimum land management regime.  However, the Administration is not prepared to support transfers of such lands without a process that provides careful consideration of the evolving needs, interests, and any supporting legislative provisions.  The Administration stands ready to consider measures and approaches to make the use of public lands for military needs more efficient.  The Administration cannot support provisions that would alter the current use and management structure of the Desert National Wildlife Refuge and strongly opposes provisions that could allow unrestricted Air Force activities in areas of the Refuge.  The Administration also recommends adoption of its proposal to standardize various land withdrawal termination dates, a measure that was replaced by the current section 2841.  Utah Test and Training Range:  While the Administration supports the appropriate and responsible use of public lands for military purposes, the Administration opposes provisions in Title XXX that would prevent the effective management of Federal lands, including those proposed for temporary use and closure.  Further the Administration strongly objects to exchanges of Federal land in Utah without adequate consideration to the Federal taxpayer or NEPA contained in section 3023 and to section 3031, which would recognize the existence and validity of unsubstantiated and disputed claims of road rights-of-way across Federal lands in Utah.  These sections are not necessary to further the military mission of the Utah Test and Training Range.   Ballast Water:  The Administration objects to Title XXXVI, which undermines the ability to fight the spread of invasive species in our Nation's waters because it, in part: would lack critical civil and criminal enforcement mechanisms present in the existing statutory and regulatory regime, the absence of which would irreparably hinder the successful prosecution of unlawful discharges; would effectively discard the existing body of domestic environmental laws as those laws apply to vessel discharges; would jettison well-established statutory and regulatory regimes that implement U.S. international legal obligations; and would fail to preserve expressly the authorities of the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior to exercise administrative control over waters under each Secretary's jurisdiction.    Maritime Administration/U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Restrictions:  The Administration opposes sections 3507 and 3508.  Section 3507 would preclude many qualified candidates with experience in managing higher learning institutions from applying for the position of 16  Superintendent or Commandant and would interfere in the operation of an institution of higher learning which could adversely impact its accreditation.  Section 3508 would eliminate MARAD's ability to use sales proceeds from National Defense Reserve Fleet non-retention vessels, leaving MARAD without funding to manage its 7,000 maritime heritage assets, many of which are on loan to maritime museums and other organizations throughout the country.  Removal of Commissioned Officers:  Section 503 would amend 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1161 to authorize the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, to remove commissioned officers in certain enumerated circumstances.  Commissioned officers are appointed either by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 531(a)(2)) or by the President alone (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 531(a)(1)).  Authorizing a subordinate official other than the President to remove an officer whom the President has appointed raises constitutional concerns under the Appointments and Take Care Clauses.  The Administration would be happy to provide technical assistance to the Congress in achieving the aims of section 503 through other constitutional means.   Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC)  Programs at Schools That Display the Confederate Battle Flag:  Section 567 would prohibit the Secretaries of military departments from establishing, maintaining, or supporting an ROTC program at any educational institution that displays the Confederate battle flag anywhere on campus other than in a museum exhibit.  The Administration strongly supports the removal of the Confederate battle flag\u2014a divisive symbol and reminder of systematic oppression and racial subjugation\u2014from the Nation's universities and other institutions.  Cutting off Federal funding for a ROTC program on the ground that an institution displays the flag, however, raises First Amendment concerns.  The Administration therefore urges Congress to pursue this important objective through other means.  Other Constitutional Concerns:  In addition, certain other provisions in this bill raise constitutional concerns, including interference with the President's exclusive authority to recognize foreign nations (section 1236) and to engage in the conduct of diplomacy (section 1234).    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.  * * * * * * *  17  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2577, making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The bill freezes or cuts critical investment in transportation that creates jobs, helps to grow the economy, and improves America's roads, bridges, transit infrastructure, and aviation systems, benefiting towns and cities across the United States, as well as investments in ending homelessness, strengthening communities, and providing rental housing assistance for poor and vulnerable families.  At a time when only one in four families who are eligible for housing assistance actually receives it, the bill would set back efforts to end homelessness and shortchange housing support for very low-income households, including families with children, the elderly, and the disabled.  The bill also reduces funding for other vulnerable populations, such as low-income children at risk of lead poisoning, and for programs that invest in public housing to revitalize distressed communities.  Furthermore, the legislation includes highly objectionable provisions, including provisions that would restrict travel to Cuba, undercut public safety, and limit State and local choices to enhance passenger rail.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2577, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  Enacting H.R. 2577 and adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending limits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-class priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to threaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be motivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense for FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and thousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and grants, adversely impacting the pace of discovery and innovation, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.    Sequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only through pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland Security, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of our economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear that he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense without also fixing non-defense.     The President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2577 and any other legislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the investments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense priorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both parties have urged.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Transportation (DOT)  Surface Transportation Funding.  The Administration strongly opposes the reductions in funding for surface transportation programs, which would essentially preclude new investments while freezing or reducing most major capital accounts below prior-year funding.  The President's FY 2016 Budget request is a fully-paid-for plan for six years of increased investment in America's infrastructure.  The $478 billion multimodal proposal includes essential program improvements that would improve safety, support critical infrastructure projects, and create jobs while improving America's roads, bridges, transit systems and railways in cities, fast-growing metropolitan areas, small towns and rural communities across the United States.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact the GROW AMERICA proposal.   Amtrak and Rail Safety.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to support the President's FY 2016 Budget request for current passenger rail service, totaling nearly $2.5 billion, and fully fund the request for the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) Safety and Operations account.  The requested funding for passenger rail service would help bring Amtrak's Northeast Corridor infrastructure and equipment into a state of good repair, implement Positive Train Control on Amtrak routes, and support rail service at a time of record ridership.  Rather than including funds for those critical investments, the bill reduces Amtrak grants by more than $1.3 billion below the FY 2016 Budget request and $250 million below last year's level.  In addition, the bill holds FRA's Safety and Operations account flat at FY 2015 levels, denying resources for additional safety inspectors and other improvements.  Restricting Travel to Cuba.  The Administration strongly objects to language in sections 193 and 414 that would restrict flights and cruise ships from going to Cuba and would place unnecessary restrictions on options for educational, religious, or other permitted travel to Cuba.    Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.  Compared to the FY 2016 Budget request, the bill would reduce funding for competitive TIGER grants by over a billion dollars, reducing TIGER funding to about 80 percent below the lowest level since the program began in FY 2009.  This is despite the fact that the program is vastly oversubscribed due to strong State and local interest, supports some of the most transformative highway, port, and transit projects in the United States, and helps State and local partners leverage public and private dollars.   Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Capital Investment Grants.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to fund the requested $3.25 billion for the FTA Capital Investment Grant 2  Program, which provides a share of funding for locally planned, implemented and operated transit capital investments that improve capacity in communities nationwide.   High Speed Rail.  The Administration also strongly objects to language in section 192 of the bill prohibiting the Surface Transportation Board from taking any action to approve subsequent phases of the California High Speed Rail project between Los Angeles and San Francisco unless the Surface Transportation Board issues a permit for the entire project.  The Administration believes passenger rail can play an important role in addressing transportation needs in many parts of the Nation and opposes any attempts to limit State and local choices to enhance passenger rail.    Infrastructure Permitting Center.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not provide the requested funding level of $4 million for the Interagency Infrastructure Permitting Improvement Center, which is essential for developing and implementing reforms that will accelerate and improve the permitting and review of major infrastructure projects.  These funds are also critically needed to develop and deploy information technology tools to help track project metrics and schedules that will lead to greater accountability and transparency.    Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Facilities and Equipment account.  The bill provides $2.5 billion for the FAA Facilities and Equipment account, $355 million below the FY 2016 Budget request and the lowest funding level in 15 years, even before taking into account inflation.  At this level, the FAA would be hampered in its ability to maintain the capacity and safety of the current National Airspace System and would be required to slow the modernization of the Nation's air traffic system through NextGen\u2014the next generation of air traffic control technology.  Continuing to defer maintenance would deteriorate the current air traffic control system, and coupling that deterioration with delaying NextGen could lead to worsening air traffic delays and higher replacement costs in the future.    Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).  The Administration is strongly concerned about the dramatic reduction in funding for transit services in the Nation's capital.  The bill would reduce funding for WMATA from the FY 2016 Budget request of $150 million, which is consistent with enacted appropriations for FY 2015 and previous years, to $100 million.  These reductions could jeopardize the safety improvements that WMATA is in the process of making.    Safe Transport of Energy Products.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not provide adequate funding for the Department to continue and further its focus on the safe movement of energy products throughout the transportation system by supporting enhanced inspection levels, investigative efforts, research and data analysis and testing in the highest risk areas.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides an increase of $8 million for the Hazardous Materials Safety account.  However, holding the Federal Railroad Administration's Safety and Operations account flat at FY 2015 funding levels inhibits its ability to hire critically needed safety inspectors to focus on the movement of crude oil across the Nation.    Highway and Motor Carrier Safety.  The Administration strongly objects to language in sections 124, 125, 126, and 132 that would undercut public safety, including by letting the trucking industry avoid truck size and weight limits and by preventing data-driven changes that would improve safety for all travelers by addressing truck driver fatigue (\"Hours of Service\").  In 3  particular, section 132 would undermine the Administration's existing regulatory work to ensure appropriate standards for commercial truck drivers' rest.  The bill imposes criteria that would in all likelihood be impossible to meet, therefore preventing critical safety provisions from taking effect.  This provision combined with the troubling changes to truck size and weight limit could significantly compromise safety on our Nation's roads.    Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request for DOT to implement the DATA Act.  This funding will support the Department's efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and employing a uniform procurement instrument identifier.   U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request for DOT to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding will support the Department in managing the agency's digital services that have the greatest impact to citizens and businesses.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Housing Choice Vouchers.  The Administration strongly objects to the $19.9 billion in funding provided for the Housing Choice Vouchers program.  This funding level is $1.2 billion less than the FY 2016 Budget request and fails to restore the 67,000 vouchers lost due to the FY 2013 sequestration, is insufficient to renew 28,000 existing vouchers, and does not provide full funding for tenant protection needs.  The bill also provides inadequate funding for the Voucher program's administrative fees so that Public Housing Authorities can ensure that units are safe and habitable.  These reductions are only more problematic in light of new research released recently that found large positive effects of housing vouchers on long-term educational and earnings outcomes for young children.   Choice Neighborhoods.  The Administration strongly opposes the $20 million funding level provided for Choice Neighborhoods, a key part of the President's Promise Zones initiative to accelerate economic mobility and revitalization in high-poverty communities.  This reduction of 75 percent from the FY 2015 level and $230 million below the President's FY 2016 Budget request would leave the program unable to fund even a single implementation grant at the average current grant size, leaving dozens of distressed communities untouched.  This reduction is particularly problematic given how recent research mentioned above and events in Baltimore and other communities make clear the negative consequences of concentrated poverty for children.  Homeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration strongly opposes the funding level for Homeless Assistance Grants, which is $295 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  Since FY 2010, the Administration has made substantial progress toward the goal of ending homelessness; the bill would set back these efforts, supporting 15,000 fewer homeless or at-risk families with rapid rehousing and 25,500 fewer units of permanent supportive housing targeted to the chronically homeless.    Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Administrative Fee and Funding.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the proposed new fee on FHA lenders and provide the full FY 2016 Budget request of $174 million for FHA administrative expenses.  The request would lower 4  taxpayer risks and improve access to mortgage credit for underserved borrowers by enabling FHA to both strengthen and clarify its lender oversight and compliance policies.    HOME/Housing Trust Fund (HTF).  The Administration strongly opposes the $767 million funding level for HOME, a reduction of more than $130 million from its FY 2015 funding level, and the bill's diversion of anticipated HTF collections to the HOME program.  By transferring funds from HTF to HOME, the bill effectively eliminates the HTF program, and provides $283 million, or 24 percent, less than the FY 2016 Budget request for these two programs.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to support HOME and the HTF, as each program complements the work of local leaders to develop affordable housing for both extremely low- and low-income families.    Housing Counseling.  The Administration opposes the $47 million in funding for HUD's Housing Counseling program, which is $13 million, or 22 percent, below the FY 2016 Budget request.  Housing counseling is an important resource in helping households achieve sustainable homeownership or find quality, affordable rental housing.    Lead Hazard and Healthy Homes.  The Administration strongly opposes the $75 million funding level for HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes.  This level, which is more than 30 percent below its FY 2015 funding level and $45 million below the FY 2016 Budget request would result in at least 3,400 fewer low-income children receiving lead hazard control in their homes.    Public Housing Programs.  The Administration opposes the $6.1 billion in funding provided for the Public Housing Operating Fund and Capital Fund programs.  This funding level is $449 million below the FY 2016 Budget request, and would delay necessary maintenance and capital improvements that would improve the deteriorating living conditions of low-income families.  The Administration also urges the Congress to provide the $50 million requested for the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) and to eliminate the 185,000 unit cap on RAD to preserve additional underfunded public housing properties at risk of loss, by converting them to long-term Section 8 contracts.   Information Technology (IT) and Digital Services.  The Administration strongly opposes the $100 million appropriation for HUD's Information Technology Fund, $234 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  This funding level provides HUD with less than half of the necessary funding for basic IT operations and would likely require shutdown of core IT systems as well as cancellation or deferral of all development, modernization and enhancement projects, putting every element of HUD's core mission at risk.  Further, the failure to fund a U.S. Digital Service team represents a missed opportunity to improve key agency services and programs that impact the public.   Technical Assistance and Research.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide sufficient funding for technical assistance and research, which are critical to support effective operation of HUD programs and inform sound policymaking.  The bill provides no funding for technical assistance and only $52.5 million for research, which in total is $77.5 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.    Energy Efficiency Requirements in HUD-Assisted Housing.  The Administration opposes the inclusion of language in section 232 that would undermine Federal energy efficiency 5  requirements in HUD-assisted housing by prohibiting the use of FY 2016 funding to require energy efficiency standards in HUD-funded construction that exceed that of State or local building codes.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.   * * * * * * *    6  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5233, which would repeal the District of Columbia's Local Budget Autonomy Amendment Act of 2012.  The Administration strongly supports home rule for the District and the President has long called for authority allowing the District to spend its own local taxes and other non-Federal funds without congressional approval.    The Administration is disappointed that the Congress has failed to provide elected leaders in the Nation's capital the most basic authority to spend local tax collections without congressional approval, an authority held by local officials across the Nation.  Subjecting the District to the lengthy and uncertain congressional appropriations process for its use of local tax collections imposes both operational and financial hardships on the District, burdens not borne by any other local government in the country.  The residents of the District and their elected leaders deserve to have the same ability as other U.S. residents and elected leaders to determine how to use their local revenues to address their unique needs.  Such authority is fundamental to a well-functioning democracy, and the Congress denying the District this authority is an affront to the residents and elected leaders of the District.   If the President were presented with H.R. 5233, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration shares the Congress'  goals of increasing transparency and bringing  Iran into compliance  with international standards in the global fight against terror finance and money laundering.  However, this bill would be counterproductive toward those shared goals.   The bill requires the U.S. Government to publicly  report all assets held by some of  Iran's highest leaders and to describe how these assets are  acquired and used.  Rather than preventing  terrorist financing  and  money  laundering, this bill would incentivize those involved to make their financial dealings less transparent and create a disincentive  for  Iran's banking sector to demonstrate transparency.  These onerous reporting  requirements also would take critical resources away  from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's important work to identify  Iranian entities engaged in sanctionable conduct.  Producing this information could also compromise intelligence  sources and methods.   One of our best tools for impeding destabilizing  Iranian activities has been to identify  Iranian companies that are controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) or other Iranians on the list of Specially  Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN  List) to non-U.S. businesses, so that they  can block assets or stop material transfers.  This process is labor-intensive and requires the judicious use of our national intelligence  assets.  Redirecting these assets to preparing this onerous public report would be  counterproductive and will not reduce institutional corruption or promote transparency within Iran's system.      In addition, this bill's required public postings also may be perceived by  Iran and likely our Joint  Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) partners as an attempt  to undermine the fulfilment of our  commitments, in turn impacting the continued viability of this diplomatic arrangement that peacefully  and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  If the JCPOA  were to fail on that basis, it would remove  the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against  Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership and our commitments to our closest  allies.   As we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed regarding  Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region.  The United States should retain all of the tools needed to counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to disrupt and interdict illicit  shipments of weapons and proliferation-sensitive technologies.  This bill would adversely affect the  U.S. Government's ability to wield these tools, would undermine the very  goals it purports to achieve, and could even endanger our ability to ensure that Iran's nuclear program is and remains exclusively peaceful.    If the President were presented with H.R. 5461, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2745, the Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2015, because it would eliminate the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) ability to use critical administrative and procedural tools to promote competition and protect consumers.  The FTC plays an important role in advancing consumers' interests and promoting competition. For over a century, the FTC has used its administrative process to challenge anticompetitive mergers and protect consumers.  H.R. 2745 would amend the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act to prevent the FTC from using its administrative adjudication process to challenge unconsummated mergers.  The bill also would require the FTC to seek certain preliminary injunctions under the Clayton Act as opposed to the FTC Act.   The changes proposed in H.R. 2745 are unnecessary and threaten to undermine the FTC's important role in protecting competition and consumers.  The FTC's administrative adjudication process has proven to be valuable in advancing and clarifying antitrust law in complex cases.  Furthermore, the bill's provisions to eliminate the FTC's ability to use its administrative adjudications for unconsummated mergers are unwarranted.  While the process the FTC uses to challenge mergers differs from DOJ's, there is no evidence that it affects outcomes or prejudices parties.  The FTC and DOJ share joint guidelines that set forth a common analytical framework for reviewing mergers.  To enjoin a proposed merger, both the DOJ and FTC must present a convincing factual and legal basis that the proposed merger would likely be anticompetitive.  Moreover, parties have recourse to Federal appellate review.    * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports Title II, which would amend funding requirements under current law for target range construction and maintenance, thus reducing the financial burden on State and local governments for public target ranges.  The Administration also supports reauthorization of the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, but has concerns about the use of funds from the Federal Land Disposal Account included in Title IX.  While the Administration also supports Title XII, which would extend an important provision in the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA), this authority has already been extended through 2026 in P.L. 114-113, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2016.   However, the Administration strongly opposes Title VI, which would:  (1) exclude management decisions from the National Environmental Policy Act, the cornerstone law guiding environmental protection and public involvement in Federal actions; (2) supersede longstanding statutory planning discretion; and (3) undermine the Wilderness Act of 1964.  The Administration also strongly opposes the following:  (1) Title I, which could prevent the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service from limiting the use of lead shot or tackle where it is threatening populations of native migratory birds and other wildlife, including on national wildlife refuges; (2) Title IV, which would prohibit the Secretary of the Army from promulgating or enforcing any regulations that would prohibit the possession of firearms at water resources development projects with limited exceptions; (3) Title VII, which would create confusion regarding the enforcement of laws on baiting of migratory birds; (4) Title X, which would interfere with the Administration's ongoing efforts to combat poaching and trafficked ivory; (5) Title XIV, which would restrict the ability of the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce to regulate certain recreational or commercial fishing access to certain waters; (6) Title XV, which would potentially create public safety issues by restricting the ability of the Secretary of Agriculture and Forest Service Chief to regulate certain hunting and fishing activities within the National Forest System; and (7) Title XVI, which would disrupt an ongoing planning effort for managing bison at Grand Canyon National Park and may cause confusion about the National Park Service's existing authorities to manage wildlife populations.     Furthermore, the Administration objects to Title VIII, which would prohibit the Director of the National Park Service from promulgating or enforcing any regulation that prohibits an individual from transporting certain inoperable bows and crossbows across any unit of the National Park System.  Finally, the Administration has concerns with:  (1) Title V, which would abolish the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council and replace it with a council that is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the framework and transparency that FACA ensures; and (2) Title XIII, which rescinds authority to manage certain commercial filming activities on Federal lands and waterways managed by the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture.   The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to enact sportsmen and recreation legislation that addresses the concerns raised with certain provisions of H.R. 2406.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes S.J.Res. 24, which would undermine the public health protections of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and stop critical U.S. efforts to reduce dangerous carbon pollution from power plants.  In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the CAA gives the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution.  In 2009, EPA determined that GHG pollution threatens Americans' health and welfare by leading to long-lasting changes to the climate that can, and are already, having a range of negative effects on human health and the environment.  This finding is consistent with conclusions of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and numerous other national and international scientific bodies.  Power plants account for roughly one-third of all domestic GHG emissions.  While the United States limits dangerous emissions of arsenic, mercury, lead, particulate matter, and ozone precursor pollution from power plants, the Clean Power Plan and the Carbon Pollution Standards put into place the first national limits on power plant carbon pollution.  The Clean Power Plan empowers States to cost-effectively reduce emissions from existing sources and provides States and power plants a great deal of flexibility in meeting the requirements.  EPA expects that under the Clean Power Plan, by 2030, carbon pollution from power plants will be reduced by 32 percent from 2005 levels.   By nullifying the Clean Power Plan, S.J.Res. 24 seeks to block progress towards cleaner energy, eliminating public health and other benefits of up to $54 billion per year by 2030, including thousands fewer premature deaths from air pollution and tens of thousands of fewer childhood asthma attacks each year.  Most importantly, the resolution would impede efforts to reduce carbon pollution from existing power plants \u2013 the largest source of carbon pollution in the country \u2013 when the need to act, and to act quickly, to mitigate climate change impacts on American communities has never been more clear.     Since it was enacted in 1970, and amended in 1977 and 1990, each time with strong bipartisan support, the CAA has improved the Nation's air quality and protected public health.  Over that same period of time, the economy has tripled in size while emissions of key pollutants have decreased by more than 70 percent.  Forty-five years of clean air regulation have shown that a strong economy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.   Because S.J.Res. 24 threatens the health and economic welfare of future generations by blocking important standards to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector that take a flexible, common sense approach to addressing carbon pollution, if the President were presented with S.J.Res. 24, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration welcomes the bill's investments in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's observational infrastructure, including funding for the next generation of polar orbiting satellites that are critical to providing accurate and timely weather forecasts.  In addition, the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for investments that would increase the International Trade Administration's trade enforcement and compliance efforts, which help ensure that U.S. businesses compete on a level playing field in the global economy.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee's support for investments in State and local assistance, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Commercial Crew program.  Finally, the Administration is pleased that the bill supports the construction of a new consolidated FBI headquarters facility to support the agency's national security and law enforcement missions.  However, the bill's inadequate funding of research, testing, and implementation activity for the 2020 Decennial Census would undermine the Census Bureau's efforts to reduce the costs of administering the 2020 Decennial Census by more than $5 billion.  The bill also fails to provide the funding necessary for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to hire the requested 200 additional agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws and keep guns out of the wrong hands.  In addition, the Administration is deeply concerned that the bill adds more than $1 billion above the FY 2017 Budget request for NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule while underfunding other key NASA programs\u2014an approach that would result in an unbalanced exploration program that is unable to achieve shared exploration goals.  The Administration also urges the Congress to enact the mandatory research and development (R&D) funding requested in NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Commerce to support the critical role that R&D plays in expanding the frontiers of human knowledge, tackling the Nation's biggest challenges, and driving the economy forward.   In October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration  looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the final bill that is presented to the President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Commerce  Census Bureau Periodic Censuses and Programs (including 2020 Decennial Census).  The Administration objects to the inadequate funding provided for the Census Bureau's Periodic Censuses and Programs account.  The FY 2017 Budget proposed a robust funding level for the Census Bureau to continue the research, testing, and implementation of new design changes that have the potential to save more than $5 billion in the 2020 Decennial Census compared to repeating previous methods.  The bill's funding level puts these design changes at risk, potentially increasing the cost to the taxpayer for administering the 2020 Decennial Census or requiring unsustainable reductions in other critical surveys such as the American Community Survey, the Economic Census, or the Census of Governments.  National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) Funding and Coordination.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for manufacturing institutes and coordination.  The FY 2017 Budget request builds on the momentum of the first Department of Commerce-led manufacturing institute, which will launch later this year, by providing the funding to launch two more institutes in FY 2017.  These institutes, which will be part of the NNMI, are designed to bridge the gap between basic research and product development to advance U.S. manufacturing capacity in critical technology areas.  These institutes have already demonstrated an ability to encourage investment and production in the United States, creating good jobs now and preparing American workers for future opportunities in the advanced manufacturing sector.  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Labs.  The Administration urges the Congress to support increased funding for high priority research initiatives at the NIST labs proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request.  These initiatives allow NIST to conduct the research necessary to strengthen U.S. leadership in the industries of the future, such as advanced communications, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing.  The Administration notes that the bill provided $24 million more than requested for lab construction and believes these funds would be better directed to the new research initiatives proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request.  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for NOAA's observational infrastructure, including high priority weather and next generation polar satellites, and urges the Congress also to support critical investments in climate and oceans research.  These investments, such as Arctic observations, the Climate Resilience Toolkit, and ocean acidification, provide information to help communities around the United States prepare for the effects of natural disasters and other ramifications of climate change and provide the science necessary to inform their preparations. 2   International Trade Administration (ITA).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $521 million, which would allow for the expansion of SelectUSA and ITA's trade promotion operations both internationally and within the United States.  These investments support U.S. companies trying to compete in a global economy by opening up new markets and helping secure new overseas investment in U.S. businesses.  Department of Justice (DOJ)  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Headquarters Consolidation Project.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's strong support for the new consolidated FBI headquarters facility by providing the FY 2017 Budget request of $646 million.  This funding\u2014together with prior year funding and resources in the FY 2017 Budget requested for the General Services Administration's Federal Buildings Fund\u2014would allow the project to proceed in a timely manner.  The project will culminate in a modern headquarters facility that is tailored to fully support FBI's national security and law enforcement missions.  Federal Law Enforcement.  While the Administration appreciates the funding provided for the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, the bill underfunds other law enforcement components of DOJ.  The Administration is especially concerned with the Committee's funding level for ATF, which is insufficient to hire the requested 200 additional agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws and regulations designed to take violent criminals off the street, deter other unlawful activity, and prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.  Bureau of Prisons.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Bureau of Prisons to improve post-incarceration outcomes.  The Administration seeks to expand mental health and substance abuse programs, provide additional vocational and educational opportunities, and to add community-based reentry programs.  These programs are needed to reduce barriers to successful re-entry.  Community Policing Initiative.  While the bill partially supports the Strengthening Police-Community Relations initiative, which includes elements of the Administration's Community Policing Initiative (CPI) proposal, it falls short of the funding necessary to ensure the success of central components of the FY 2017 Budget request.  Improving community-police relations is crucial to maintaining public safety and confidence in the criminal justice system.  The Administration appreciates the $50 million the bill provides for CPI funding, including partial funding of the request for Smart Policing, Body Worn Cameras (BWC), and the Collaborative Reform Initiative.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request, which would expand the Building Community Trust and Justice Initiative, further increase the use of BWCs, and enable the Office of Community Oriented Policing (COPS) to partner with more law enforcement agencies and cities that may need assistance on a wide variety of criminal justice issues.  State and Local Grants.  The Administration appreciates the overall funding level provided for criminal justice assistance.  The bill provides $2.3 billion for State and local grants, which is approximately $235 million above the FY 2017 Budget request.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the request for the COPS Hiring program, which would support hiring for more than 1,200 community policing officers nation-wide.  The Administration is also concerned with the significant reduction to juvenile justice programs.  These programs help reduce juvenile 3  delinquency and crime, protect public safety, hold offenders accountable, assist missing and exploited children and their families, and provide treatment and rehabilitative services tailored to the needs of juveniles and their families.  Violence Against Women.  The Administration appreciates the support for Violence Against Women Act programs as well as the Community Teams to Reduce the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Backlog and Improve Sexual Assault Investigations Program.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the request for the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies Program and the Legal Assistance Program in order to address critical needs in the fight to stop violence against women.  Investments in these programs would help to improve victim safety, save lives, and establish practices that can be sustained in the coming years.  General Legal Activities.  The Administration is concerned that the bill fails to provide any of the increases requested in the FY 2017 Budget to enhance the efforts of legal divisions, including:  the Civil Rights Division to improve police-community relations, protect the rights of servicemembers, and expand access for people with disabilities; the Environment and Natural Resources Division to improve environmental protection in Indian Country and enhance the safety of America's workforce; the Civil Division to enhance elder justice efforts and enforce immigration laws; and INTERPOL Washington to keep pace with increasing requests for international law enforcement information sharing and coordination.  The bill provides $893 million for General Legal Activities, which is $64 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  Guantanamo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 527 and 528 of the bill, which would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions.  Operating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens U.S. national security by draining resources, damaging U.S. relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and U.S. national security interests.  Moreover, section 527 would violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances.  Restrictions on Combatting Unlawful Gun Trafficking.  The Administration strongly objects to numerous provisions that would inhibit efforts to combat illegal gun activities, including unlawful trafficking, particularly where there has been little or no meaningful engagement with ATF on the provisions and their application.  These include restrictions preventing ATF from curtailing the importation of \"curio or relic\" firearms or ammunition and denying applications to import shotguns that do not meet the statutory \"sporting purposes\" test.  The Administration also urges the Congress to repeal a number of other unnecessarily restrictive provisions made permanent in prior years.  Legal Services Corporation (LSC)  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the $475 million requested in the FY 2017 Budget for LSC, supporting grants for high-quality civil legal assistance to low-income 4  Americans.  LSC grantees represent the working poor, veterans, homeowners and renters, families with children, farmers, people with disabilities, and the elderly.  Women\u2014many of whom are struggling to keep their children safe and their families together through restraining orders and custody challenges\u2014comprise 70 percent of clients.  At the reduced level of $395 million provided in the bill, thousands of otherwise eligible low-income Americans would be denied legal assistance, impacting their due process rights and fair treatment in the courts.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  Funding Balance.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's robust overall funding level for NASA.  However, the Administration is deeply concerned that the bill adds more than $1 billion above the FY 2017 Budget request for the SLS rocket and Orion capsule while underfunding other key NASA programs.  Continued congressional focus on these large-scale development programs at the expense of the technologies and capabilities needed to make space exploration affordable and future missions achievable would result in an unbalanced exploration program that is unable to achieve shared exploration goals.  Exploration R&D.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for Exploration R&D, including funds to initiate a public/private partnership to create a deep space habitat and to proceed with the Asteroid Redirect Mission.  Underfunding the request would leave the SLS and Orion without missions and needed capabilities when their testing is complete.  Space Technology.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for NASA Space Technology.  Compared to the request, the bill reduces funding for these investments by $140 million, or 17 percent, and includes programmatic direction that further reduces the funding available for planned missions.  Impacts would likely include delaying development of a cutting-edge laser communication system, advanced, high power solar electric propulsion, and other space technology demonstrations, slowing progress on the journey to Mars, and reducing the international competitiveness of the U.S. commercial space industry.  Aeronautics.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for Aeronautics.  The bill's reduction of $190 million from the request would likely force NASA to abandon its new series of experimental aircraft intended to make aircraft faster, greener, and more efficient and to ensure the U.S. aerospace industry's leadership.  Science.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for NASA Science programs.  Compared to the request, the bill reduces funding by over $200 million, potentially delaying or cancelling space science missions in development, terminating operating missions, and reducing new funding for research grants.    Space Operations.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for NASA Space Operations, for which the bill provides $125.2 million below the request.  National Science Foundation (NSF)  Agency Operations and Award Management.  The Administration is concerned that the bill underfunds the required costs associated with the agency's plans to move its headquarters in FY 2017 and would therefore impact the agency's ability to carry out its mission. 5   Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee provided $53 million more than requested for the Major Research Equipment and Facility Construction account and believes these funds would be better directed to other NSF initiatives.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)  Topline Funding.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill underinvests in EEOC by freezing the agency at last year's funding level, which is $12 million below the FY 2017 Budget request, and urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request.  A freeze in funding would result in EEOC's fourth year of essentially flat funding, which would compromise EEOC's ability to target and remedy employment discrimination and ensure that individuals alleging discrimination have timely access to justice.  This level would impede EEOC's ability to reduce its private-sector charge backlog and leverage technology to increase efficiency and customer service.   Other Issues  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, and NSF to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.  Constitutional Concerns  Several provisions in the bill, particularly sections 509 and 519, would raise constitutional concerns in certain applications by intruding upon the President's constitutional authority over international diplomacy.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  6  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that the Nation's veterans have access to the care, services, and benefits that they have earned.  Over the past seven years, the President has maintained a steadfast commitment to serving veterans and their families.  More veterans are now receiving health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) than ever before, and VA is delivering more benefits to more veterans in a timely and efficient manner.  The Administration is working to end veteran homelessness in cities and states across the country, and has reduced veteran homelessness by nearly half.  Under the leadership of the First Lady and Dr. Biden, through their Joining Forces initiative, the Administration has called on all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families to support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities.  And Secretary McDonald has initiated the most sweeping organizational transformation in the history of VA, ensuring that the agency is keeping veterans' best interests at the center of everything it does.  H.R. 5620 includes a provision that would enable another essential reform that would build on this record of progress.  By fundamentally restructuring the current process by which veterans can appeal their initial benefits claims decisions, this legislation would ensure that veterans receive the benefits they have earned and are not subject to years of endless waiting and duplicative process.  The current appeals process \u2013 built up over 80 years of overlapping laws and regulations \u2013 is broken and is failing both veterans and taxpayers.  Today, more than 450,000 appeals are pending at some point in the process, with veterans waiting an average of at least 3 years for a decision.  Moreover, the problem is only going to get worse if the system is not fundamentally reformed.  VA projects that, under the current process, the number of pending appeals will soar to more than 2.17 million by the end of 2027, which will require a significant increase in resources to address and result in veterans continuing to wait for an appeals decision for years.  In response to this critical problem, the Administration, with the support of major veteran advocacy groups, put forward a comprehensive appeals reform proposal that would fix this system.  The essential feature of this new approach is to step away from a unified appeals process that tries to do many unrelated things inside a single process and replace that with differentiated lanes, which give veterans clear options after receiving an initial decision on a claim.  And it would allow all veterans to have a clear answer and path forward on their appeal within one year from filing.  H.R. 5620 adopts this comprehensive reform proposal, and the Administration strongly supports this provision.    However, the Administration is deeply concerned that H.R. 5620 contains numerous provisions that would undermine VA's workforce and could ultimately hinder the ability of the over 330,000 dedicated civil servants at VA to effectively serve veterans.  The Administration is  strongly committed to strict accountability standards that ensure VA employees act with the best interests of veterans in mind, and instances of misconduct or poor performance in carrying out these duties cannot be tolerated.  But the Administration believes that the approach to accountability in the legislation \u2013 focused primarily on firing or demoting employees without appropriate or meaningful procedural protections \u2013 is misguided and burdensome.  This approach significantly alters and diminishes important rights and protections that are available to the vast majority of other employees across the government and which are essential to safeguarding employees' rights and the merit system.  Furthermore, the legislation allows for the broad recoupment of awards earned by VA employees, and prevents VA from rewarding its high-performing senior executives.  These provisions will make it more difficult for VA to attract the top talent that is needed to serve veterans, limit the rights of VA employees and senior executives, and set back the work done by VA to rebuild veterans' trust.  In addition, many of the provisions in the legislation raise constitutional concerns.  Most significantly, certain provisions compress the time period within which VA employees would receive notice and an opportunity to be heard on charges against them before the Secretary of VA may take disciplinary action, including removal, and provide an expedited appeal process in which the disciplinary action would be automatically affirmed if the reviewing agency failed to rule within a certain number of days.  We would welcome the opportunity to work with the Congress to address these due process concerns and other potential constitutional concerns raised by the bill.  The Administration encourages the Congress to ensure that accountability actions support, rather than impede, the ability of VA to carry out its duties, and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to address these and other important issues on behalf of the Nation's veterans and their families.    * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 2048, the USA FREEDOM Act. The President has called on Congress to enact important changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that enhance privacy and better safeguard our civil liberties, while keeping our Nation safe.  The Administration applauds and appreciates the strong bipartisan and bicameral effort that led to the formulation of this bill, which strikes an appropriate balance between significant reform and preservation of important national security tools.    The bill strengthens the FISA's privacy and civil liberties protections, while preserving essential authorities our intelligence and law enforcement professionals need to protect the Nation.  The bill would implement various reforms, including prohibiting bulk collection through the use of Section 215, FISA pen registers, and National Security Letters, while maintaining authorities to conduct more targeted collection.  It also enhances transparency by expanding the amount of information providers can disclose and requiring the government to increase its public reporting as well.    The USA FREEDOM Act's significant reforms would provide the public greater trust and confidence in our national security programs and the checks and balances that form an integral part of their operation.  Without passage of this bill, critical authorities that this legislation would reform could expire on June 1.  The Administration supports swift House passage of the USA FREEDOM Act, and urges the Senate to follow suit.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration's proposal provides a focused approach to facilitate more cybersecurity information sharing while ensuring the protection of individuals' privacy and civil liberties.  As the Administration has previously stated, information sharing legislation must carefully safeguard privacy and civil liberties, preserve the long-standing respective roles and missions of civilian and intelligence agencies, and provide for appropriate sharing with targeted liability protections.  The Administration commends the House Homeland Security Committee for its efforts to craft cybersecurity information sharing legislation with strong privacy protections.  While the Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1731, improvements to the bill are needed to ensure that its liability protections are appropriately targeted to encourage responsible cybersecurity practices.  The Administration recognizes the importance of the House and Senate working together to achieve these shared goals and supports advancing this legislation so that improvements can be made as the legislative process continues. While the bill has improved significantly, the Administration still has concerns with H.R. 1731's sweeping liability protections.  Appropriate liability protections should incentivize good cybersecurity practices and should not grant immunity to a private company for failing to act on information it receives about the security of its networks.  Such a provision would remove incentives for companies to protect their customers' personal information and may weaken cybersecurity writ large.  The Administration believes that a reasonable solution that strikes an appropriate balance can be found.  The Administration appreciates that the bill preserves the long-standing, respective roles and missions of civilian and intelligence agencies.  Similar to the Administration's proposal, H.R. 1731 authorizes cybersecurity information sharing with a civilian agency, specifically the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center.  This approach will help protect privacy and provide appropriate transparency.  In addition, charging one agency with facilitating the near real-time exchange of cyber threat indicators will enhance the efficacy of information sharing efforts and is more effective from an operational standpoint. Cybersecurity requires a whole-of-government approach, including the ability to share relevant cybersecurity information quickly amongst relevant agencies.  Once information is shared with the Federal Government, it should be shared with appropriate agencies in as close to real-time as  possible so that the Federal Government can use the information to better defend the Nation'snetworks.  This sharing must be governed by certain narrow use limitations \u2013 an essential part of overlapping privacy and civil liberties protections that also rely on transparent oversight.  The Administration would seek to clarify that information shared with the Federal Government canbe used for investigating, prosecuting, disrupting, or otherwise responding to appropriate crimes. H.R. 1731 also authorizes the use of certain potentially disruptive defensive measures in response to network incidents, provisions that were not included in the Administration's proposal.  The use of defensive measures without appropriate safeguards raises significant legal, policy, and diplomatic concerns and can have a direct deleterious impact on information systems and undermine cybersecurity.  Moreover, as drafted, these provisions may prevent the application of other laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and State common law tort remedies.  Though the Administration remains concerned that the bill's authorization to operate defensive measures is not adequately tailored, it is committed to working with stakeholders to address its remaining concerns. Information sharing is one piece of a larger suite of legislation needed to provide the private sector, the Federal Government, and law enforcement with the necessary tools to combat cyber threats.  In addition to updating information sharing statutes, the Congress should incorporate privacy and civil liberties safeguards into all aspects of cybersecurity and enact legislation that creates a strong and consistent notification standard for breaches of personal data, as well as legislation that gives law enforcement the tools to fight cybercrime in the digital age.  * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1734, because it would undermine the protection of public health and the environment provided by the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s) December 2014 final rule addressing the risks posed by mismanaged impoundments of coal ash and other coal combustion residuals (CCR).  The 2008 failure of a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, and the 2014 coal ash spill into the Dan River in Eden, North Carolina, serve as stark reminders of the need for safe disposal and management of coal ash.  EPA\u2019s rule articulates clear and consistent national standards to protect public health and the environment, prevent contamination of drinking water, and minimize the risk of catastrophic failure at coal ash surface impoundments.  H.R. 1734 would, however, substantially weaken these protections.  For example, the bill would eliminate restrictions on how close coal ash impoundments can be located to drinking water sources.  It also would undermine EPA\u2019s requirement that unlined impoundments must close or be retrofitted with protective liners if they are leaking and contaminating drinking water.  Further, the bill would delay requirements in EPA\u2019s final CCR rule, including structural integrity and closure requirements, for which tailored extensions are already available through EPA\u2019s rule and through approved Solid Waste Management Plans.  While the Administration supports appropriate State program flexibility, H.R. 1734 would allow States to modify or waive critical protective requirements found in EPA\u2019s final CCR rule.  Specifically, H.R. 1734 authorizes States to implement permit programs that would not meet a national minimum standard of protection and fails to provide EPA with an opportunity to review and approve State permit programs prior to implementation, departing from the long-standing precedent of previously enacted Federal environmental statutes.    Because it would undercut important national protections provided by EPA\u2019s 2014 CCR management and disposal rule, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1734.  If the President were presented with H.R. 1734 as drafted, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5424.  Actions taken in the years since enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act are curbing excessive risk-taking, closing regulatory gaps, and making our financial system safer and more resilient.  For the first time, advisers to private funds with more than $150 million in assets are required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); comply with new recordkeeping, reporting, and audit requirements; and file systemic risk reports.  The President has been clear about his opposition to any legislation that would weaken or reduce oversight of the financial system.    Specifically, H.R. 5424 would create a loophole providing a broad exemption from audit and exam requirements, leaving investors unable to verify that funds actually contain particular investments as claimed.  The bill would also make it more difficult for the SEC to police the market, particularly with respect to investments in uncertificated, private securities for which advisers would not be required to keep any record.  Further, H.R. 5424 would repeal important safeguards, including the requirements that advisers: notify clients of a change in ownership or control of the adviser, deliver a plain language narrative brochure to clients annually, and disclose certain information on large private equity funds to regulators.   The exemptions that this bill provides would enable private fund advisers to slip back into the shadows.  H.R. 5424 unnecessarily puts working and middle-class families at risk while benefitting Wall Street and other narrow special interests.  Considering that investors in private equity funds include public pension funds \u2013 which support our Nation's teachers, police officers and firefighters \u2013 the Congress should be encouraging the SEC to fully implement the enhanced investor safeguards provided in current law, not repealing important protections.  Therefore, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5424 and urges the Congress to act responsibly by enacting laws that enhance protections for investors and help working and middle-class families.  If the President were presented with this legislation, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3009.  This bill fails to offer comprehensive reforms needed to fix the Nation's broken immigration laws, undermines current Administration efforts to remove the most dangerous convicted criminals and to work collaboratively with State and local law enforcement agencies, and threatens the civil rights of all Americans by authorizing State and local officials to collect information regarding any private citizen's immigration status, at any time, for any reason, and without justification.  The Administration continues to believe that it is critical to fix the Nation's broken immigration system through comprehensive commonsense legislation that builds on existing efforts to strengthen border security, cracks down on employers hiring undocumented workers, streamlines legal immigration, and offers an earned path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to get right with the law if they pass background checks, contribute to the Nation's economy by paying taxes, and go to the back of the line.  While the Senate passed comprehensive legislation with strong bipartisan support over two years ago that would do just that, the House of Representatives failed to take any action.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, that legislation would also grow the Nation's economy by 5.4 percent and reduce Federal deficits by nearly $850 billion over 20 years.  The Administration continues to urge the Congress to address all of the problems with the Nation's broken immigration system and take up commonsense legislation that will offer meaningful solutions to those problems.  The Administration also believes the most effective way to enhance public safety is through sensible and effective policies that focus enforcement resources on the most significant public safety threats.  The Administration has put in place new enforcement priorities that do just that, focusing limited resources on the worst offenders \u2013 national security threats, convicted criminals, gang members, and recent border crossers.  The effectiveness of these new priorities depends on collaboration between Federal, State, and local law enforcement.  Every day, the Federal government fosters State and local collaboration through a variety of mechanisms, including policies, programs, and joint task forces.  The Department of Homeland Security's Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) enables Federal immigration enforcement to work with State and local law enforcement to take custody of individuals who are enforcement priorities, including public safety and national security threats, before those individuals are released into communities.  PEP is a balanced, commonsense approach to enforcing the Nation's immigration laws.  It replaced the Secure Communities program, which, by establishing a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to State and local cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement officials, discouraged some localities from turning over dangerous individuals to DHS custody.  Secure Communities was embroiled in litigation and widely criticized for undermining State and local community policing efforts.  PEP builds collaboration between Federal, State, and local law  enforcement that allows for the most effective enforcement while enhancing community policing and trust.  The Congress should give PEP a chance to work, instead of displacing that collaborative approach\u2014which prioritizes the worst offenders\u2014with the coercive approach of this bill, which makes no such differentiation.  Finally, the bill would condition Federal money on State and local governments allowing their law enforcement officials to gather citizenship and immigration status information from any person at any time for any reason.  The Administration believes that such blanket authority would threaten the civil rights of all Americans, lead to mistrust between communities and State and local law enforcement agencies, and impede efforts to safely, fairly, and effectively enforce the Nation's immigration laws.    If the President were presented with H.R. 3009, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration is deeply committed to respecting tribal sovereignty and maintaining government-to-government relationships with Indian tribes as well as to protecting American workers and enforcing Federal labor laws.  The Administration cannot support H.R. 511, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2015, as currently drafted, because it does not include the provisions as explained below.  The President's commitment to tribal sovereignty has taken many forms\u2014from establishing the White House Council on Native American Affairs, to reaffirming tribal authority to prosecute non-Indians under the Violence Against Women Act, and to promoting tribal self-determination by signing into law the Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Homeownership (HEARTH) Act so that tribes may lease their lands without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.   At the same time, the President is firmly dedicated to protecting American workers.  The Administration vigorously enforces Federal labor laws and has repeatedly emphasized the importance of strengthening workers' rights to collective bargaining.   The Administration is encouraged by the efforts of some tribal governments to balance these important interests and find common ground when formulating compacts to operate casinos on tribal land under the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  In several of these compacts, tribes have agreed to establish their own labor relations policies.  Though these compacts differ on minor details, what they have in common is that they generally protect tribal self-governance while also ensuring that most casino workers retain important and effective labor rights.  It is thus possible to protect both tribal sovereignty and workers' rights, and the Administration can only support approaches that accomplish that result.  Therefore, the Administration can support a bill which recognizes tribal sovereignty in formulating labor relations law and exempts tribes from the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board only if the tribes adopt labor standards and procedures applicable to tribally-owned and operated commercial enterprises reasonably equivalent to those in the National Labor Relations Act.  Amended legislation would also need to include an authorization for funding to support the development and implementation of tribal labor laws and regulations.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5055, making appropriations for energy and water development, and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.  While the bill increases certain energy research and development activities, it underfunds critical energy research and development activities overall. The bill does not put the Nation on a sufficiently ambitious path toward doubling clean energy research and development by FY 2021. Specifically, H.R. 5055 underfunds the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs, with levels significantly below the FY 2017 Budget request, which would undermine critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies.  At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement.  The bill also eliminates funding for important restoration efforts by the Bureau of Reclamation on the San Joaquin River, which would undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts as well as efforts to help address long-term water challenges in the drought-sensitive San Joaquin region.  Furthermore, the legislation includes highly problematic ideological provisions, including provisions that threaten to undermine our ability to protect a resource that is essential to America's health:  clean water.  Despite these shortcomings, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in improving resilience against current and ongoing climate impacts that threaten the economy, public health, and natural resources.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee's strong support for the National Nuclear Security Administration's Weapons Activities, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors programs.  In October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the President were  presented with H.R. 5055, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Energy (DOE)  Mission Innovation.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for certain increases in clean energy RD&D investment, including for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E). These increases are directionally consistent with Mission Innovation, helping move clean energy RD&D forward. Despite these gains however, the bill underfunds critical energy research and development activities overall, and does not put us on a sufficiently ambitious path toward doubling clean energy research and development by FY 2021. The bill underfunds investment in our students, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs; our businesses and universities; and our future economy.  This would slow the pace of progress on breakthroughs in energy efficiency and clean energy; undermine America's long-standing nonpartisan support for pioneering research that seeks solutions to pressing problems; and hinder our ability to harness the power of new ideas and innovation to drive sustained economic growth in the clean energy economy of the future.   Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration objects to the  $306 million provided in the bill for ARPA-E, which, while an increase relative to enacted levels, is a reduction of $44 million or 14 percent from the discretionary request for ARPA-E in the FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduction would hinder the ability to invest in transformational technologies that reduce energy-related emissions, increase energy efficiency across multiple economic sectors, and reduce energy imports.     Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  The Administration strongly objects to the $1.8 billion provided in the bill for EERE.  Overall, this level is $1.1 billion below the FY 2017 Budget request.  Relative to the FY 2017 Budget request, the bill reduces funding for renewable energy by 36 percent, sustainable transportation by 37 percent, and energy efficiency by 30 percent.  These reductions would significantly underfund critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies including wind energy, electric and other advanced vehicles, and building technologies.  At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced or cancelled, limiting innovation and technological advancement.  Funding at this level also would impede the development of solutions to reduce U.S. dependency on oil and reduce energy waste, and undermines the Nation's competitiveness in the future global clean energy economy.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request of $2.9 billion.    Office of Science.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Office of Science and the funding level of $5.4 billion provided in the bill, this is $172 million below the FY 2017 Budget request and would significantly impact basic research and development (R&D) programs, most critically in Foundational Genomics Research and Bioenergy Research Centers within Biological and Environmental Research.   Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund important grid modernization activities at the FY 2017 Budget request level of $262 million instead of the $225 million provided in the bill.  This funding supports important grid 2  modernization activities including State Distribution Level Reform and State Energy Assurance which respond to Quadrennial Energy Review recommendations.   Yucca Mountain.  The Administration objects to the funding provided in the bill for Yucca Mountain and is disappointed with the rejection of the strategy proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request on nuclear waste.  The strategy incorporates important and practical solutions for a successful waste program, such as consent-based siting, interim storage of waste, and program funding reforms that are essential to the success of a Nuclear Waste Program.    Fossil Energy Research and Development.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide adequate funding for clean energy priorities by using or reallocating $240 million in balances within the Fossil Energy R&D account identified in the FY 2017 Budget request as unnecessary for Fossil Energy R&D activities.   Energy Security and Infrastructure Modernization Fund.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund the Energy Security and Infrastructure Modernization Fund, as proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request.  Modernization of Strategic Petroleum Reserve infrastructure is necessary to ensure the operational readiness of the Reserve.   Energy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request of $131 million for EIA to completely fund investments in adding regional detail to petroleum data, enhancing commercial building energy efficiency data, and expanding international analysis.   Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided full funding for DOE to implement the DATA Act within the Departmental Administration account.  This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.    U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided sufficient flexibility to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOE to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.    Departmental Administration.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Office of Indian Energy as a separate budget account.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's increased funding for this office, especially for important project oversight efforts.  However, funding the Office of Indian Energy within the Departmental Administration account without additional resources has reduced available funding for other management and program support functions which may significantly hinder DOE's ability to effectively and efficiently implement other priority management objectives.    National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)  Nonproliferation Construction.  The Administration strongly objects to continued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility.  It would be irresponsible for the Congress to require continued construction of this project.  The alternative disposition method is expected to be significantly faster and less expensive than the wasteful approach the bill would mandate.  3  Continuing to require construction would waste limited national security funds and force more pressing nuclear security needs to go unmet.  A recent independent study mandated by the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act indicates that even at a higher level of funding ($375 million annually) it would take another century (program completion date of 2115) and involve lifecycle costs of over $100 billion to complete the plutonium disposition effort using MOX.  Alternative disposition would free up funds for other national security priorities, dispose of the excess plutonium safely and effectively, and meet international obligations decades sooner.   Unrequested NNSA Rescissions.  The Administration objects to section 308 of the bill which, in combination with other rescissions in the bill, would rescind more than twice the amount proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request.  A rescission of this size would come at the expense of vital nuclear modernization and nonproliferation programs.    Corps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works (Corps)  Overall Funding.  The bill funds the Corps civil works program at a net level of nearly  $6.1 billion.  The Administration appreciates the bill's investments in helping communities reduce the risk of floods, improving commercial navigation, and the Corps' efforts to restore the Nation's aquatic ecosystems requested in the FY 2017 Budget.  However, the Administration believes funding included in the bill for the Corps beyond the FY 2017 Budget request would not provide a high return on investment to the American taxpayer.    Ecosystem Restoration.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for ecosystem restoration activities, such as Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration, Columbia River Fish Mitigation, South Florida Ecosystem Restoration, and Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Recovery, at the levels provided in the FY 2017 Budget request.    Technical Assistance.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee's support for funding ongoing efforts that provide local communities with technical and planning assistance to enable them to reduce their flood risk, including nonstructural approaches.  Clean Water Act (CWA).  The Administration believes that the CWA provisions in the bill undermine efforts to protect America's clean water resources, which are critical to American families and businesses.  The Administration strongly objects to section 110 of the bill in particular, which would disrupt the Administration's current efforts to clarify the scope of the CWA, hamstring future regulatory efforts, and create significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance.    CWA Recapture.  The Administration strongly opposes section 109 of the bill, aimed at preventing the Corps from using the funds provided to require a CWA permit for pollutant discharges that impair or destroy wetlands and other waters.  Section 109 would overturn nearly 40 years of CWA implementation that exempts from permitting farming practices in the Nation's wetlands and eliminates regulatory burdens for farmers while protecting the Nation's water resources.  Section 109 is inconsistent with administration efforts to provide farmers and ranchers with greater certainty and predictability under the CWA, reduce regulatory burdens, and protect human health and the environment.  This is particularly troublesome for discharges that convert areas of navigable waters into new uses where the flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the reach of those waters may be reduced. 4   Firearms Policy.  The Administration objects to section 111 of the bill, which prohibits the Corps from enforcing bans on firearms at water resources development projects.  If enacted, this provision would prevent the Secretary of the Army from using the discretion now provided in law to enforce or revise the current Corps policy, based on considerations such as the security of critical infrastructure, public and employee safety, and the manner in which the firearm is carried (e.g., open vs. concealed).  Corps rangers are not authorized to carry firearms and do not have full Federal law enforcement authority.    National Ocean Policy.  The Administration objects to section 506 of the bill, which prohibits funding provided in the bill from being used to implement the coastal and marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management components of the National Ocean Policy.  This provision would prohibit DOE and the Corps from participating in marine and coastal planning efforts that would improve stewardship of the Nation's oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.    Dam Removal. The Administration objects to section 507 of the bill, which prohibits funding provided in the bill from being used for the removal of any federally owned or operated dam.  While dams can provide numerous benefits to local communities, collaboratively developed strategies to remove obsolete or unnecessary dams can be important components of broader efforts to reduce public safety risks, improve the health of our rivers, and support our local economies.  Nationwide Flood Study.  The Administration urges the House to restore the $1 million requested in the FY 2017 Budget for the ongoing Water Resources Priorities study, which has the potential to help save lives and billions of dollars.  This study addresses a critical need to develop a baseline assessment of flood risks at a national and regional scale; evaluate the overall effectiveness of current approaches; and develop recommendations to reduce flood damages, loss of life, and recovery costs, in ways that would also promote the long-term resilience of communities and ecosystems.    U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for the Corps to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.    Other Independent Agencies  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Yucca Mountain.  The Administration objects to the funding provided in the bill for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue adjudication of the Yucca Mountain license application.   POWER+ Plan.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided $50 million to the Appalachian Regional Commission for the POWER+ Plan, fully funding the FY 2017 Budget request.  The funding would help create jobs, attract capital investments, and strengthen workforce development for communities and workers that have been negatively affected by job losses in coal mining, coal power plant operations, and coal-related supply chain industries due to the changing economics of America's energy production.    5  Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project  Overall Funding.  The bill provides $1.1 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and $11 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Act.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for priorities within the Bureau of Reclamation's program, as reflected in the FY 2017 Budget request, including Indian Water Rights settlements, and the WaterSMART program.    San Joaquin River Restoration.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's elimination of funding for this program, which would undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts.  This restoration program is a multi-year effort that is integral to the implementation of Federal legislation that settled 18 years of litigation.  The Congress has provided funding each year since authorizing, and the Administration urges the Congress to provide FY 2017 funding for this Administration priority at the level requested.    California Water.  The Administration strongly opposes sections 204 through 208 of the bill, which include several highly problematic provisions that undercut the Endangered Species Act and limit application of court-approved biological opinions, thereby resulting in detrimental conditions for Federal- and State-listed endangered species.  Furthermore, these provisions preempt California water law, fail to address critical elements of California's complex water challenges and would, if enacted, impede an effective and timely response to the continuing drought while providing no additional water to hard hit communities.  These provisions could actually slow decision-making, generate significant litigation, and limit real-time operational flexibility critical to maximizing water delivery.  As the Administration has stated in the past, these provisions were developed with little input from the public, the Administration, or key stakeholders affected by the drought.  The urgency and seriousness of the California drought requires a balanced and flexible approach that promotes water reliability and ecosystem restoration.    Authorizations for Continued Operations.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill did not include the language requested in the FY 2017 Budget to increase the appropriations ceiling for the Secure Water Act and to extend the California Bay-Delta Restoration authorization.   Constitutional Concerns  Section 201 of the bill raises separation of powers concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  6  ", "The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of the Senate amendment to H.R. 3762.  By repealing numerous, key elements of current law, this legislation would take away critical benefits and health care coverage from hard-working middle-class families.  The bill also would remove policies that are expected to help slow the growth in health care costs and that have improved the quality of care patients receive.  The Senate amendment to H.R. 3762 detracts from the work the Congress could be doing to foster job creation and economic growth.   The Affordable Care Act is working and is fully integrated into an improved American health care system.  Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is a thing of the past.  And under the law, health care prices have grown at the slowest rate in 50 years, benefiting all Americans.   Repealing key elements of the Affordable Care Act would result in millions of individuals remaining uninsured or losing the insurance they have today.  An estimated 17.6 million Americans gained coverage as several of the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions have taken effect \u2013 15.3 million since the beginning of the first open enrollment in October 2013.  The Senate amendment to H.R. 3762 would roll back coverage gains and would cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage they deserve.    Repealing the health care law would have implications far beyond these Americans who have or will gain insurance.  More than 150 million Americans with employer-based insurance would be at risk of higher premiums and lower wages, or losing their coverage altogether.  It would raise taxes on certain middle-class families.  The Senate amendment to H.R. 3762 also would defund the Prevention and Public Health Fund, limit women's health care choices, and disproportionately impact low-income individuals.  This legislation is being considered by the Senate just days ahead of the December 15 deadline for Marketplace coverage that starts on January 1, 2016. Rather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal basic protections that provide security for the middle class, Members of Congress should be working together to grow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs.  If the President were presented with H.R. 3762, as amended by the Senate amendment, he would veto the bill. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration appreciates the bipartisan support for medical research in H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act, and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on strategies to prevent and cure disease and improve health.    In particular, the Administration appreciates the legislation\u2019s support for the President\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative, which would advance a new model of participant-centered research to accelerate biomedical discoveries and provide clinicians with new tools and therapies tailored to individual patients\u2019 needs.  This will also require enabling patients to access their data and accelerating interoperability between electronic health records.  The Administration also believes we can build on our progress in improving the drug development and approval process by incorporating patients\u2019 voices into the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) decision-making; encouraging the development and qualification of reliable biomarkers to accelerate work on important new therapies; and reducing barriers to initiating medical device trials.  H.R. 6 takes meaningful steps on each of these important issues and includes provisions to pay for the new funding included in the bill.  While the Administration welcomes the additional support for biomedical research and innovation included in H.R. 6, the Administration has concerns about providing additional funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and FDA without addressing sequestration more broadly.  Sequestration funding levels threaten not only NIH research, but also other investments in innovation.  They threaten health care access and quality, not only by underfunding biomedical research, but also by underfunding key public health and mental health programs.  The President has proposed a plan to reverse sequestration and increase funding for NIH by $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2016 while making other pro-growth investments.  Separately, the new responsibilities for FDA outlined in H.R. 6 exceed the resources provided in the bill and the President\u2019s FY 2016 Budget and as such, FDA will be unable to fully implement the programs established in the bill, while maintaining its current performance levels.   H.R. 6 also proposes to sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a source of funding.  The Administration reiterates the critical importance of making the investments necessary to modernize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and ensure it continues to support U.S. energy security.  The Administration remains concerned about extending drug exclusivity beyond current law and how this provision will affect drug costs.  The Administration is also concerned that this bill would make funding subject to problematic ideological riders included in appropriations bills.  The Administration believes funding should be free of such riders.  The Administration also believes that H.R. 6 could undermine regulatory standards by allowing unproven uses of therapies to be marketed to health care payors as though such uses had been proven safe and effective.     Further, while the Administration supports strengthening the Government\u2019s ability to hire and retain qualified scientific experts, we look forward to working with the Congress to do this while promoting accountability.  Finally, the Administration appreciates the bipartisan interest in advancing the interoperability of health information technology and remains focused on the need to strengthen this critical foundation for delivery system reform and precision medicine.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on continuing to improve the bill as it moves forward.    * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 692, which would result in the Congress not paying obligations it has already agreed to, thereby putting the Nation into default on its obligations.  Any legislative proposal to prioritize certain payments over others is default by another name and would not protect the full faith and credit of the United States government or avoid the negative impact of default on American jobs and businesses.  Such an approach would be the equivalent of a family saying that it will choose to pay its mortgage, but not its car payment, credit card, or student loans, and expecting that its creditworthiness will not suffer.  It would cause the Nation to default on payments for Medicare, veterans, national security, and many other key priorities.  Making some payments while not making others would be unacceptably risky and unfair to the American people.   Under the President\u2019s leadership, annual deficits have come down by roughly three-quarters as a share of the economy since 2009, the fastest period of sustained deficit reduction since just after World War II.  In Fiscal Year 2015, the deficit fell by $44 billion to just 2.5 percent of GDP\u2014a level significantly below the roughly 3-percent level needed to stabilize our debt-to-GDP ratio.  The President has put forward a balanced approach to deficit reduction in his FY 2016 Budget that would continue to stabilize the Nation's debt as a share of the economy, without shortchanging the kinds of investments that are critical to long-term economic growth.    The President continues to work to find areas of compromise and common ground with both parties in the Congress.  But the President has been clear that he will not negotiate about whether to uphold the full faith and credit of the United States.  The Congress must pay the bills it has already incurred; failure to do so would cause the Nation to default on our obligations for the first time in history.   The President will not tolerate political gamesmanship, which caused the Nation\u2019s credit rating to be downgraded in 2011 and proved harmful to both the United States and global economy.  For this reason, if the President is presented with legislation that would result in the Congress choosing to default on our obligations and imperil the full faith and credit of the United States, he would veto it.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.J.Res. 88 because the bill would overturn an important Department of Labor final rule critical to protecting Americans' hard-earned savings and preserving their retirement security.  The outdated regulations in place before this rulemaking did not ensure that financial advisers act in their clients' best interest when giving retirement investment advice.  Instead, some firms have incentivized advisers to steer clients into products that have higher fees and lower returns \u2014 costing American families an estimated $17 billion a year.  The Department's final rule will ensure that American workers and retirees receive retirement advice in their best interest, better enabling them to protect and grow their savings.  The final rule reflects extensive feedback from industry, advocates, and Members of Congress, and has been streamlined to reduce the compliance burden and ensure continued access to advice, while maintaining an enforceable best-interest standard that protects consumers.  It is essential that these critical protections go into effect.  If the President were presented with H.J.Res. 88, he would veto the bill.    * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015, which would undermine critical investments in science, technology, and research.  The Administration believes that H.R. 1806 would be damaging to the Administration's actions to move American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth forward through a world-leading science, technology, and innovation enterprise. The Administration strongly opposes the bill's appropriation authorizations for the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) that would establish maximum funding levels significantly below those provided in the President's FY 2016 Budget.  For example, H.R. 1806 would weaken investments in critical clean energy research and development and grid modernization by providing authorization levels at less than half of the funding levels proposed in the President's Budget for DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.  Additionally, the legislation would shortchange efforts to support fundamental research to address diverse and critical global challenges by providing an authorization level for the DOE Office of Science biological and environmental research program far short of the funding levels proposed in the President's Budget.  The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 would also establish NSF authorizations levels for geosciences, education and human resources, international and integrative activities, and administrative activities well below the funding levels proposed in the President's Budget, as well as an NSF authorization for social, behavioral, and economic sciences research that is 58 percent below the President's Budget.  Additionally, the legislation would undermine efforts to implement sound science and technology policies by providing an authorization level for OSTP nearly 20 percent below the President's Budget.  In addition to its strong opposition to the authorized funding levels in H.R. 1806, the Administration has serious concerns with several other provisions in the bill and looks forward to working with the Congress to address its concerns.  For example, the Administration opposes barring Federal regulatory authorities from relying on the results of certain Federally-supported research and development.  This provision would set an extremely harmful precedent of political interference in the scientific integrity of the regulation process, which would undermine the value of the Federal research and development enterprise as a whole.  The Administration also objects to the increased administrative burdens that the bill imposes on NSF and its awardees without commensurate benefit.  In addition, the Administration opposes reducing oversight at the DOE National Laboratories, which would increase the exposure of the Federal Government to risk and liabilities while also conflicting with the execution of the DOE mission.   H.R. 1806 undermines key investments in science, technology, and innovation and imposes unnecessary and damaging requirements on Federal support of research.  If the President were presented with H.R. 1806, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 758 because it is both unnecessary and counterproductive.  H.R. 758 would limit the discretion of courts for violations of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 11 requires attorneys to certify pre-filing that pleadings are not presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.  H.R. 758 would require courts to impose monetary sanctions, including court costs and attorney fees, for any Rule 11 violation.  The bill would eliminate the safe harbor provision that currently allows attorneys to correct or withdraw a filing before Rule 11 proceedings commence.  H.R. 758 would also circumvent the usual procedure for amending the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  H.R. 758 was introduced to curb a perceived increase in frivolous litigation; however, the proposed changes to Rule 11 will actually increase litigation.  By creating an automatic financial incentive, and by removing the safe harbor provision, the proposed changes to Rule 11 could dramatically increase the number of sanctions motions, including those filed against Federal government attorneys, and correspondingly increase the risk of financial exposure for any conduct that might be considered a Rule 11 violation.  In short, H.R. 758 would raise the amount and cost of civil litigation and provide more opportunity for unnecessary delay and harassment.  The Administration is particularly concerned that the new requirements could be used to target consumer and civil rights plaintiffs.  Consumer abuse and civil rights cases can rely heavily on the discovery process to prove the merits of their claims.  In addition, civil rights cases often seek to challenge the law or to extend existing precedents.  The threat of mandatory sanctions for failure to withstand a Rule 11 challenge could chill meritorious claims by deterring worthy plaintiffs, who often lack the financial resources to pay costs and fees, from challenging existing laws or seeking novel interpretations of them.  The bill is also opposed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the principal policymaking body for the Judicial Branch charged with proposing amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure under the careful, deliberate process outlined in the Rules Enabling Act.  The Congress has tasked the Judicial Conference to serve as the principal policymaking body for the Judicial Branch.  The Congress has thus empowered the Federal judiciary to make its own procedural rules, retaining the right to review those rules and to accept, modify, or reject them.  H.R. 758 is an attempt to amend the rules directly, over the objections of the Judicial Conference.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1090 because the bill would derail an important Department of Labor rulemaking critical to protecting Americans\u2019 hard-earned savings and preserving their retirement security.  H.R. 1090 prohibits Labor from issuing a rule to protect investors until the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acts.  It also impinges on the SEC\u2019s ability to move forward with its own rulemaking by requiring the SEC to take the misguided step of providing definitive findings before promulgating a rule.   Further, the bill ignores the fact that significant study has already been conducted by both agencies and that Labor has had extensive engagement with the public, industry, and numerous stakeholders in its rulemaking process.  This includes more than 140 days of public comment period, four days of public hearings, and approximately 100 meetings with stakeholders after the proposal was published in April.  Moreover, Labor and the SEC are already working closely to ensure the smooth operation of the proposed safeguards, and this legislation would hamper effective coordination between the two agencies.  Under existing, outdated rules, savers cannot count on receiving the unbiased advice that they need and expect.  This bill would effectively block action to protect working and middle-class families from the harmful conflicts of interest that lead to biased advice.  The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that these conflicts cost savers $17 billion every year.    The Administration is committed to ensuring that American workers and retirees are able to receive advice about how to invest their money in safe, secure, and transparent financial products that are free from harmful conflicts of interest.  Labor's ongoing rulemaking is designed to protect the retirement savings of millions of workers and retirees by ensuring that paid advisors and other entities do not place their own financial interests over those of their customers.  This legislation puts a roadblock in the way of preventing such harmful conflicts, which hurts businesses, consumers, and retirees and their families.

The legislation would provide two years of significant relief from sequestration for both defense and non-defense priorities, helping to grow the economy and build middle-class economic security by investing in education, job training and research while keeping America safe.  The agreement would ensure that relief from sequestration is paid for in a balanced way, while also shielding programs that working families depend on and protecting Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries from harmful cuts.  This bill also would raise the Nation's debt limit, preserving the full faith and credit of the United States.  The Administration urges the Congress to pass this bipartisan agreement and looks forward to working with the Congress to enact responsible, full-year FY 2016 appropriations \u2013 without ideological riders \u2013 based on this agreement in order to continue growing the Nation's economy and creating jobs.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1927 because it would impair the enforcement of important Federal laws, constrain access to the courts, and needlessly threaten the privacy of asbestos victims.   Class action lawsuits allow groups of individuals with similar injuries to vindicate their rights efficiently and effectively.  Courts already have ample authority under the existing rules governing class actions to screen out frivolous and baseless lawsuits.  H.R. 1927 would expand upon the existing rules by requiring the plaintiffs in a class action to demonstrate that each member of the proposed class suffered the same type and scope of injury.  This new requirement would narrow the availability of class actions, potentially dissuading plaintiffs from pursuing meritorious claims, including under important civil rights, privacy and consumer protection laws, and denying them access to justice.  Moreover, there is already an established process for amending the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which is the more appropriate vehicle for ventilating and potentially adopting the proposed revision of Rule 23 standards regarding class actions.  In addition, based on the false assertion that there is endemic fraud in the asbestos trust system, H.R. 1927 would impose mandatory reporting and disclosure requirements that would release into the public domain asbestos victims' names, exposure histories, and other sensitive information.  This disclosure would threaten their privacy, make them more vulnerable to identity thieves and other predators, and potentially disadvantage them in many ways unrelated to asbestos exposure, including in their efforts to obtain employment, credit, and insurance.

In the past, the Congress has managed the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through a series of short-term patches, creating significant uncertainty for the FAA and undermining the agency's ability to make long-term capital investments and plan for the future.  Though the Administration believes that eighteen months do not provide the long-term certainty that the FAA needs to advance on its critical priorities, the Administration appreciates that the bill is intended to enable a longer-term dialogue about the future of our aviation system.  The Administration's priorities for a long-term aviation reauthorization bill include the need to ensure safety, serve the public interest, modernize the air traffic control system, and better align aviation resources with the needs of the National Airspace (NAS).  The bill contains some provisions that advance these priorities.  However, it also includes provisions that would undermine the FAA's ability to address critical challenges, like mandating controller hiring preferences and limiting FAA's ability to make business-like decisions about its services.  There are also a number of provisions within the bill that need to be improved, particularly as it relates to safety, security, and the environment.  For example, with regards to safety, while the Administration shares Congress' goal of fast and efficient integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the NAS, the FAA must be able to maintain regulatory flexibility.  The bill would direct the Department of Transportation to develop certification standards for small UAS so that companies could engage in the widespread transportation of property two years from passage.  This kind of overly prescriptive means of integrating UAS using legislation would disrupt the ongoing rulemaking process.  From a security perspective, the bill would require the Transportation Security Administration to establish screening and other measures at certain small airports, meaning the agency would be required to reallocate staff and equipment from higher-risk, higher-need facilities. The bill also includes provisions related to air tours over national parks, which could negatively impact the visitor experience and protection of park natural resources.  The bill also should do more with regards to infrastructure investment.  For the past seven years, the Administration has called on the Congress to provide flexibility to airports to invest in a stronger aviation system.  This bill misses an opportunity to improve airport infrastructure by not allowing for adjustments to Passenger Facility Charges in tandem with reforms to the Airport Improvement Program.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to pass an FAA reauthorization  bill that strengthens our aviation system, improves safety, and maintains the leadership of the U.S. in global aviation.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly supports passage of the bipartisan House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 34, the 21st Century Cures Act, which dedicates more than $6 billion to implement key priorities such as the President's proposal to combat the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic; the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot; and the President's signature biomedical research initiatives, the Precision Medicine and Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiatives.  It also takes important steps to improve mental health, including provisions that build on the work of the President's Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force, and includes policies to further modernize the drug approval process.  The legislation includes $1 billion over two years, including $500 million in Fiscal Year 2017, to combat the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, consistent with the President's budget request.  More Americans now die every year from drug overdoses than they do in motor vehicle crashes, and the majority involve opioids.  The opioid epidemic is devastating families and communities and straining the capacity of law enforcement and the healthcare system.  The resources included in the bill will allow states to expand access to treatment to help individuals seeking help to find it and to start the road to recovery, with preference given to states with an incidence or prevalence of opioid use disorders that is substantially higher relative to other states.    The Administration is committed to taking immediate action to lay the groundwork to ensure that the funds in the bill would be disbursed quickly and effectively so we can begin to address these important public health challenges.  The bill also includes $1.8 billion, including $1 billion over the next three years, to support the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot.  The Moonshot aims to accelerate research efforts and make new therapies available to more patients, while also improving our ability to prevent cancer and detect it at an early stage.  The resources in this legislation will support investment in promising new therapies like cancer immunotherapy, new prevention tools, cancer vaccine development, novel early detection tools, and pediatric cancer interventions.  As the Vice President and scientific experts have said, we are at an inflection point in cancer research and this investment could help seize this opportunity.   The legislation also dedicates support for other key research initiatives.  In 2013, the President launched the BRAIN Initiative with the goal of helping researchers find new ways to treat, cure, and prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury.  In 2015, he launched the Precision Medicine Initiative to pioneer a new model of patient-powered research that promises to accelerate biomedical discoveries and provide clinicians with new tools, knowledge, and therapies to select which treatments will work best for which  patients.  The bill creates dedicated funding of $1.5 billion for the BRAIN initiative and $1.4 billion for the Precision Medicine Initiative to continue these signature Presidential Initiatives, which have broad bipartisan support, over the next decade.    The legislation also includes bipartisan mental health reforms.  These include a renewed emphasis on evidence-based strategies for treating serious mental illness, improved coordination between primary care and behavioral health services, reauthorization of important programs focused on suicide prevention and other prevention services, and mental health and substance use disorder parity provisions that build on the work of the President's Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force.    In addition, the bill takes multiple steps to further the progress made in this Administration in improving the drug development process.  It enhances the ongoing efforts to better incorporate patients' voices into the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision-making processes; supports FDA's efforts to modernize clinical trial design; and improves FDA's ability to hire and retain scientific experts.  The legislation includes strong protections for individuals' health data, as well as provisions preventing unnecessary restrictions on the sharing of health information technology data with patients and providers.    There are also provisions in the bill that raise concerns, but that have been modified from previous versions to help address concerns, such as provisions that allow for the marketing of drugs to payors for off-label uses.  In addition, a number of effective dates will be challenging to meet, especially without additional administrative funding.  The requirement to sell additional inventory from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, when added to the sale requirements of the Bipartisan Budget Act and the FAST Act, continues a bad precedent of selling off longer term energy security assets to satisfy near term budget scoring needs.  That said, this legislation offers advances in health that far outweigh these concerns.  As such, the Administration strongly supports passage of the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 34, the 21st Century Cures Act.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 348, which would undercut responsible decision-making and public involvement in the Federal environmental review and permitting processes.  As the Administration said when virtually identical legislation was considered previously, H.R. 348 would increase litigation, regulatory delays, and potentially force agencies to approve a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed arbitrary deadlines.  This legislation would complicate the regulatory process and create two sets of standards for Federal agencies to follow to review projects \u2013 one for \"construction projects\" and one for all other Federal actions, such as rulemakings or management plans.    This Administration is committed to modernizing the Federal permitting and review process for major infrastructure projects to provide certainty for project applicants, reducing the aggregate time it takes to conduct reviews and make permitting decisions, and producing measurably better environmental and community outcomes.  However, the Administration strongly rejects the legislation's premise that public input and responsible agency decision-making under current law hinders job creation.  The Administration believes that H.R. 348, if enacted, would lead to more confusion and delay, limit public participation in the permitting process, and ultimately hamper economic growth.    The Administration supports efforts to improve the efficiency of the environmental review processes without diminishing requirements for rigorous analyses, agency consultation, and public participation.  Since 2011, the Administration has prioritized improving the environmental review process and continues to make advancements in this space that will improve interagency coordination and synchronization of reviews to increase decision-making speed; improve project siting and application quality; expand innovative mitigation approaches; and drive accountability and transparency through the expanded use of an online permitting dashboard.  For example, under Executive Order 13604, the interagency infrastructure permitting steering committee established the permitting dashboard, which makes project schedules transparent to the public and is designed to improve the timeliness and environmental outcomes of the permitting process.  In the coming months, additional projects requiring complex permitting actions will be posted to the dashboard in an effort to improve project delivery.  If the President were presented with H.R. 348, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4768, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act of 2016, because it would unnecessarily overrule decades of Supreme Court precedent, it is not in the public interest, and it would add needless complexity and delay to judicial review of regulatory actions.  This legislation would allow Federal courts reviewing an agency action to conduct de novo review of all relevant questions of law without deferring to the legal interpretation of the agency.  Both Federal statutes and case law provide Federal courts with the appropriate tools to review regulatory actions and afford appropriate deference to the expertise of the agencies that promulgated the rules and regulations under review.     If the President were presented with H.R. 4768, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 650, which would weaken key consumer protections and provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.   Specifically, the bill would revise the Truth in Lending Act to allow manufactured housing lenders to raise the cost of loans to consumers without triggering existing rules designed to protect consumers from loans they cannot afford to repay.  Many borrowers purchasing manufactured homes are among the lowest income and economically vulnerable consumers.  H.R. 650 would put these borrowers at significant risk of being subjected to predatory lending and being steered into more expensive loans even when they qualify for lower-cost alternatives.  There is no reason to deny these borrowers the consumer protections that they receive today.  Because H.R. 650 would weaken key consumer protections and provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, if the President were presented with H.R. 650, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 5053, the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, which would constrain the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) ability to enforce tax laws and reduce transparency.  Current IRS rules generally require tax-exempt organizations, including section 501(c) organizations, to report the names and addresses of substantial donors (generally, donors of $5,000 or more) as part of their tax returns.  In addition, section 501(c)(3) private foundations and section 527 political organizations are required to make this contributor information publicly available.  H.R. 5053 would prohibit the IRS from requiring section 501(c) organizations to report this information with limited exceptions.  By permanently preventing the IRS from requiring reporting of donor information by 501(c) organizations, H.R. 5053 would constrain the IRS in enforcing tax laws and reduce the transparency of private foundations.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5485, making appropriations for financial services and general government for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes.  The bill's reductions in funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) exacerbate the damaging reductions inflicted on the IRS since 2010, and irresponsibly cut funding for the agencies charged with implementing Wall Street reform.  The bill also underfunds the Federal Trade Commission's efforts to promote economic competition.  Furthermore, the legislation includes highly problematic ideological provisions, including provisions that restrict the IRS's ability to implement the Affordable Care Act (ACA), interfere with important new regulations designed to protect consumers from risky or abusive lending, and undermine the principle of home rule for the District of Columbia.  These provisions also prevent the Federal Communications Commission from promoting a free and open internet and encouraging competition in the set-top box market, impacting millions of broadband and cable customers.  Furthermore, these provisions would bar Federal agency efforts to reduce the risks and costs of flood disasters.  Despite these shortcomings, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in entrepreneurship and small business financing.    In October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.    If the President were presented with H.R. 5485, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.     Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The Administration strongly objects to the $766 million reduction in funding for the IRS compared to the FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduction would bring IRS funding to FY 1993 levels, in real terms, hindering the agency's efforts to provide robust service to taxpayers, improve enforcement operations, and implement new statutory responsibilities.  Furthermore, these reductions would negatively impact efforts aimed at deficit reduction, with enforcement revenues in FY 2017 estimated to be more than $11 billion lower than if FY 2010 staffing levels had been maintained.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes sections of the bill that limit IRS funding and transfers to carry out implementation of the ACA, under which millions of individuals have signed up for coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplaces.  The Administration also objects to provisions that unnecessarily encumber IRS operations with burdensome reporting requirements and that would constrain enforcement of tax laws.  Departmental Offices.  The Administration appreciates the support for targeted investments in Department-wide cybersecurity enhancements.  However, the Administration objects to the bill's defunding of the Department's Systems and Capital Investment Program and is disappointed that the bill fails to permit funding for oversight and administration of the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund to be paid from the Trust Fund.  In total, the bill would require a $27.4 million reduction in funding from the comparable level in the FY 2017 Budget request for core Departmental Offices Salaries and Expenses.  Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the CDFI Fund, which is funded above the FY 2017 Budget request.  However, the Administration is disappointed that the bill provides neither the $22 million requested for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, which offers financial and technical assistance to expand the availability of healthy food options in distressed communities, nor the $10 million requested for the Small Dollar Loan Program to expand access to small dollar loans in underserved communities and combat predatory lending.  The Administration also appreciates the continuation of the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program, but is concerned about the $250 million limitation on new commitments, which is below the program's annual average commitment level.  This lower level of commitment authority would unnecessarily constrain the provision of long-term capital in low-income and underserved communities.  Office of Financial Research (OFR) and Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  The Administration strongly opposes section 130 of the bill, which would subject OFR and FSOC to the annual appropriations process beginning in FY 2018.  This language would hinder the independence of these entities and limit their ability to develop critical market analysis and improve regulator coordination if future funding shortfalls prevent information technology (IT) investments or the hiring of highly-skilled staff.  The Administration also opposes onerous new procedural requirements that could effectively prohibit FSOC from formally designating nonbank financial companies whose material financial distress could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes section 129 of the bill, which would require OFR to publish notice 90 days prior to issuing any report, rule, or regulation; research reports are intended to provide independent analysis of the facts, unswayed by public or political sentiment.  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration 2  appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for Government-wide implementation of the DATA Act, and urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Department of the Treasury's own implementation of the DATA Act.  This funding supports efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and linking financial and Federal award data with the Award ID.  Executive Office of the President (EOP)  EOP Funding and Operations.  The Administration objects to section 621 of the bill, which would continue a prohibition on paying salaries and expenses for certain White House staff positions and impinge on the President's ability to organize EOP operations.  The Administration appreciates funding for Presidential transition costs but strongly objects to the lack of funding for Unanticipated Needs, which would severely hamper the President's ability to meet unexpected requirements for the furtherance of the national interest, security, or defense.  The Administration also objects to the funding level in the bill for the National Security Council, which is $2.1 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  The Administration strongly opposes the funding level in the bill for OMB, which is $10 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduction would significantly diminish OMB's ability to carry out its mission.  The Administration also objects to continuation of bill language that would require burdensome OMB cost estimates to accompany the issuance of all Executive Orders, as well as language that requires OMB to submit a report to the Congress estimating the costs of implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, an onerous and duplicative report of limited value.  Information Technology Oversight and Reform (ITOR).  The Administration strongly opposes the funding level in the bill for the ITOR account, which is $10 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  ITOR funds important efforts to improve the most critical public-facing Federal digital services through the application of best practices in product design and engineering by the U.S. Digital Service and its agency partners.  The ITOR fund also supports efforts to protect Federal systems through implementation of leading solutions to address new and constantly evolving advanced, persistent cyber-threats, drive value in Federal IT investments, and implement the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act.  The bill's reductions to these initiatives would undermine efforts to secure the Nation's highest value information targets and build on successful reforms to the Federal Government's management of IT resources, which have resulted in about $3.6 billion in cost savings and avoidance.  General Services Administration (GSA)  Overall GSA Funding.  Funding for GSA is an integral part of supporting agencies in their performance of critical missions.  The bill's funding level would undermine GSA's ability to deliver services, impacting agencies Government-wide.   Federal Buildings Fund (FBF).  The Administration finds the bill's funding level for the FBF unacceptable at nearly $934 million below the FY 2017 Budget request and the anticipated level of rent collections from other Federal agencies in FY 2017.  The bill also denies critical construction funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Headquarters project and the next phase of the Department of Homeland Security's headquarters consolidation at St. 3  Elizabeths, Washington, D.C.  Since FY 2011, the Committee has chosen to fund the FBF at levels billions below what GSA collects in rent from agencies.  Underfunding construction and renovation is particularly damaging, as the Government must be a good steward of its own assets, able to take advantage of opportunities to save money over the long term and maintain its buildings adequately to avoid more costly failures in the future.  Further, the practice of chronically underfunding the FBF is unfair to other Federal agencies, who are no longer receiving the space and services that they are paying for, as well as to the other appropriations subcommittees who are providing funds that are never used for their intended purpose.   FBI Headquarters.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the full request in the FY 2017 Budget for the new consolidated FBI headquarters facility.  The bill provides only $200 million, $559 million below the FY 2017 Budget request for GSA for construction of the new FBI headquarters.  In total, the FY 2017 Budget requests $1.4 billion for the FBI headquarters project\u2014 $646 million for FBI and $759 million for GSA's Federal Building Fund.  Full funding of the FY 2017 Budget request is required for GSA to award a design and construction contract for the project this year.  Absent a new, modern, and secure headquarters facility, the ability of the FBI to fully support its critical national security and law enforcement missions may be compromised.   Information Technology (IT) Modernization Fund.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee does not provide the requested $100 million for the IT Modernization Fund (ITMF), part of a larger $3.1 billion request in the FY 2017 Budget that creates a revolving fund to retire and replace legacy IT systems across Government.  Absent funding for the ITMF, the cost to operate and maintain legacy systems, as well as security vulnerabilities and other risks, would continue to grow.   Unified Shared Services Management (USSM).  The Administration urges the Congress to support the $5 million requested in the FY 2017 Budget for the establishment of the USSM, a new organization housed in GSA that would serve as an integration body for the shared services environment.  The funding is needed to give the USSM a stable funding source.  Small Business Administration (SBA)  SBA Support for Businesses.  The Administration appreciates the strong support for small businesses through the bill's robust funding for the SBA's business loan and entrepreneurial development programs.  The SBA's business loan programs would support over $46 billion in lending to small businesses in FY 2017, and the increased funding for technical assistance and development programs would ensure business owners can effectively deploy capital to grow their businesses and create good jobs.  However, the Administration opposes the elimination of funding for Regional Innovation Cluster grants and Growth Accelerators, as these innovative programs help regions leverage their unique assets to create jobs by turning entrepreneurial ideas into sustainable high-growth small businesses.  Disaster Loans Program.  The Administration urges the Congress to utilize the disaster relief cap adjustment authorized in the Budget Control Act of 2011 to fund the $159 million FY 2017 Budget request for SBA's administrative costs associated with major disasters.  By not utilizing the cap adjustment, the bill makes unnecessary reductions to other programs to accommodate this line of support to small businesses after a disaster has struck.  4  Other Independent Agencies  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Administration strongly objects to the funding level of $1.55 billion for SEC, which is $226 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  The bill would hinder SEC's enforcement, examination, and market oversight functions and undercut investor protections strengthened by Wall Street Reform that benefit both consumers and Main Street.  The bill would also shortchange SEC's core programs by mandating that funding for IT initiatives increase by $50 million over the FY 2016 enacted level and prohibiting authorized IT spending from the agency's mandatory Reserve Fund.  Taken together, these provisions would inhibit SEC's ability to improve oversight and examination functions in a way that investors expect and deserve.  The SEC is fee-funded and its funding level has no impact on the deficit, nor does it impact the amount of funding available for other agencies.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The Administration strongly opposes sections 502 and 503 of the bill that subject CFPB to annual appropriations and politicizes its leadership, which would severely weaken its independence and undermine its ability to serve the most vulnerable consumer populations.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes sections 506, 637, 638, and 639 of the bill that undermine key consumer protections by preventing the CFPB from finalizing or implementing payday lending and arbitration regulations and would amend the Truth in Lending Act to deny borrowers protections from certain high-cost loans.  These are problematic, ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of this bill.  Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).  The Administration objects to the total funding level of $120 million for CPSC, an $11 million reduction below the FY 2017 Budget request.  This funding level would significantly impede CPSC's public safety mission intended to safeguard consumers, particularly children, from hidden hazards that continue to cause death and severe injuries, including its ability to expand the import surveillance program through which CPSC identifies hazardous products that can cause injury or death before these goods can enter the U.S. market.  In addition, the Administration objects to section 510 of the bill that would continue to prohibit CPSC from using funds to finalize or implement mandatory standards for recreational off-highway vehicles (ROVs) until CPSC commissions and completes a study with the National Academy of Sciences.  This provision could indefinitely delay CPSC's ability to complete rulemaking on ROVs, potentially compromising public safety.  The language also would undermine the Commission's statutory independence and authority to write public safety regulations, interfering with its regulatory independence and public safety mission.  Election Assistance Commission (EAC).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the full $9.8 million requested for EAC in the FY 2017 Budget, including $1.5 million for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  The $4.9 million provided in the bill is half of the funding requested in the FY 2017 Budget.  Such a significant reduction would severely limit EAC's ability to assist State and local entities administer Federal elections, test and certify voting equipment, and provide information about voting system standards.  Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The Administration strongly opposes the deep reductions to the funding level for FCC, which is $53 million, or 14 percent, below the FY 2017 Budget request.  These reductions unnecessarily force FCC to scale back important work on public safety and wireless spectrum, delay efforts to modernize IT systems, and undermine efforts to save the taxpayers money by consolidating office space and improving oversight of the Universal Service Fund.  The Administration objects to the $106 million cap on auction program 5  funding, which is $18 million, or 15 percent, below the FY 2017 Budget request.  This would severely harm the FCC's efforts to modernize its auction infrastructure to support the increasingly complex auctions of the future, which have the potential to return tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury.  FCC, Open Internet Order.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 630, 631, and 632 that aim at delaying or preventing implementation of FCC's net neutrality order.  The order, which was issued after a lengthy rulemaking process that garnered input from four million Americans, ensures a level playing field that is increasingly vital to the future of the Nation's digital economy and online competition.  For almost a century, U.S. law has recognized that companies who connect Americans to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of Americans' homes or businesses.  It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information\u2014whether a phone call, or a packet of data.  The FCC's rules recognize that broadband service is of the same importance, and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do.  These carefully-designed rules have already been implemented in large part with little to no impact on the telecommunications companies making important investments in the U.S. economy, and would ensure that neither the cable company nor the phone company would be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what Americans can do or see online.  The appropriations process should not be used to overturn the will of both an independent regulator and millions of Americans on this vital issue.  FCC, Set-top Rule.  The Administration opposes section 636 that aims at delaying the FCC from adopting or enforcing new rules to open the video set-top box market to additional competition.  Currently, 99 percent of cable and satellite TV consumers rent set-top boxes directly from the cable providers, costing households an average of $230 per year.  The FCC is already committed to a lengthy, thorough rulemaking process that would establish a robust record of comment and analysis from companies, non-profit organizations, and academics.  The current provision unnecessarily interferes with these long-established processes by requiring a delay of at least 270 days, and probably much longer, and a redundant, potentially costly study.  Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  The Administration is concerned that the Committee is underfunding the efforts by the FTC and the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Antitrust Division to protect American consumers from criminal cartel practices\u2014such as price fixing, fraud, and currency manipulation\u2014and anticompetitive mergers.  Since 2010, the number of proposed $1 billion \"mega mergers\" reviewed annually by the FTC and DOJ's Antitrust Division has more than doubled.  Anticompetitive mergers can harm American consumers significantly by raising prices, reducing quality, limiting output, restricting consumer choice, and stifling innovation in markets such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals, defense contracting, energy and petroleum, cable television and internet, cell phones and service, airline travel, appliances, and common food items.  The bill provides $317 million for the FTC, $25 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  United States Postal Service.  The Administration strongly opposes new language in the bill that would roll back cost saving measures implemented by the Postal Service over the last four years.  The Administration is also disappointed that language under the Payment to the Postal Service Fund account would prohibit the Postal Service from modifying its delivery schedule to better adapt to its current business environment.  Each year, the President's Budget has proposed balanced reforms to provide the Postal Service with the operational flexibility to continue to 6  meet its universal service obligation and implement structural changes that would help put it on a sustainable trajectory.  While the Congress has failed to act, the Postal Service has undertaken significant administrative reforms under existing authority to reduce expenses.  Despite these efforts, since FY 2012 the Postal Service has been forced to default each year on scheduled payments to reduce its unfunded liability for retiree health benefits and is expected to default on an additional $5.8 billion due during FY 2016.  The Postal Service estimates that reversing four years of service changes would increase its operating deficit by roughly $1.5 billion annually and impose an additional $500 million in one-time costs.  Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB).  The Administration objects to the funding level of $8.3 million in the bill for the PCLOB, which is $1.8 million, or more than 17 percent, below the FY 2017 Budget request.  The funding level provided would impair PCLOB's ability to maintain sufficient staff to independently and robustly assess the multi-billion dollar counterterrorism enterprise's efforts to balance privacy and civil liberties.  The Congress and the Executive Branch have asked the Board to analyze a number of complex issues that are subject to ongoing public debate, including electronic surveillance.  The impact of the funding reduction on the Board's staffing would hinder its ability to satisfy these requests.   Udall Foundation.  The Administration opposes the elimination of funding requested in the FY 2017 Budget for the Udall Foundation, which provides education and research resources to American Indians and Alaska Natives.  In addition, through the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution, the Foundation provides mediation services for conflicts involving Federal agencies or interests.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the Udall Foundation at the $5 million level included in the FY 2017 Budget request.  District of Columbia (D.C.)  D.C. Local Budget Autonomy.  The Administration does not object to the one-year shutdown exemption in section 816 of the bill, which would allow D.C. to spend local funds in the event of a lapse in appropriations in FY 2018.  However, the Administration strongly objects to section 817 of the bill, which repeals the D.C. Local Budget Autonomy Act of 2012.  The residents of the District and their elected leaders deserve to have the same ability as other U.S. residents and elected leaders to determine how to use their local revenues.  Such authority is fundamental to a well-functioning democracy and the denial of such authority is an affront to the residents and leaders of the District.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt provisions included in the FY 2017 Budget request that would permanently allow the District to use local funds without congressional action.  Restrictions on the District's Use of Local Funds.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that bars the elected leaders of the District of Columbia from determining how to use local revenues.  Specifically, the Administration strongly opposes section 810 of the bill, which prohibits the District from using both Federal and local funds for abortion services for low-income women.  Longstanding policy prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered, but restrictions on the District's use of local funds for abortion services is contrary to the principle of home rule.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes the restriction in section 809(b) of the bill on the use of both Federal and local funds for regulatory or legislative activity pertaining to recreational use of marijuana, which was approved by D.C. voters.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the provisions in the FY 2017 Budget request that limit the abortion and 7  recreational marijuana restrictions to Federal funds.  D.C. Syringe Services Program.  The Administration strongly opposes the restriction in the bill on the use of Federal funds for the District's syringe services program.  This is contrary to current law, which prohibits the use of Federal funds for syringe services programs only in locations where local authorities determine such programs to be inappropriate.  D.C. Education Funding.  The Administration strongly opposes the $20 million funding level in the bill for the Tuition Assistance Grant Program (TAG), which is $20 million below the FY 2017 Budget request level.  TAG provides grants of up to $10,000 per year to District residents to cover the difference between in-State and out-of-State tuition at public colleges and universities and helps to make college affordable for many low-income District residents.  In addition, the Administration opposes the $30 million funding level in the bill for D.C. public schools, which is $10 million below the FY 2017 Budget request, and the Administration strongly opposes the additional $12 million the bill provides for the Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), a private school voucher program.  The Administration appreciates the bill's support for evaluation and administration of OSP and will continue to use available OSP funds to support students returning to the program until they complete school, but strongly opposes additional funding for more vouchers.  The Administration remains focused on improving the quality of public schools for all children rather than supporting a handful of students in private schools.  D.C. Water and Sewer Authority.  The Administration opposes the bill's lack of funding for D.C. Water and urges the Congress to provide the $14 million included in the FY 2017 Budget request for ongoing work on the combined sewer overflow project.  Other Issues  Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2016.  The Administration is concerned by the inclusion of Title XI in an appropriations act.  Revisions to the bankruptcy code have no place in an appropriations bill and the Financial Institutional Bankruptcy Act of 2016 (HR 2947) has been referred to the Senate where it should be considered in due course.    Abortion Coverage Under Multi-State plans Administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  The bill would expand current prohibitions on funding for abortion services and related administrative expenses in connection with Multi-state Plans (MSPs) administered by OPM.  Section 641 appears to preclude OPM from spending any funds appropriated by this Act to administer MSPs that cover abortion services with non-Federal funds under segregated funding requirements.  This expansion is not necessary to protect Federal funds and would restrict private insurance choices as well as women's access to healthcare.  Coal-Fired Power Plant Protections.  The Administration opposes section 131 of the bill, which would prohibit the use of FY 2017 appropriated funds for the enforcement of rules, regulations, policies, or guidelines implemented pursuant to certain Administration policies intended to limit public financing for coal-fired or other high-carbon-intensity power projects overseas\u2014policies that have catalyzed similar commitments from other major exporting countries and multilateral financial institutions.  These prohibitions impede U.S. leadership in reducing carbon pollution, promoting climate solutions and preparedness, and meeting our responsibility to future generations. 8   Cuba.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 132, 133, 134, and 135, which would severely undermine the President's policy on Cuba that aims to improve the lives of the Cuban people and advance U.S. interests through expanded travel, commerce, and the free flow of information.  The Administration strongly opposes section 132 on non-academic educational exchanges, as it would result in a reduction of people-to-people interactions and as such is counter to the Administration's policy to increase overall travel and the flow of information and resources to private Cubans.  This provision is an unwarranted restriction on purposeful travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens, who are the best ambassadors to the Cuban people of our values and ideals.  The Administration also strongly opposes section 133 regarding property confiscated by the Cuban Government, which could severely chill authorized U.S.-Cuba commerce designed to support the Cuban people.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes section 134, which is overly broad and, as written, could significantly undermine the ability for U.S. persons to engage in otherwise authorized business in order to more effectively support the Cuban people.    Federal Flood Risk Management Standard, Executive Order (E.O.) 13690.  The Administration objects to section 745 of the bill, which prohibits any funds from being used to implement, administer, carry out, modify, revise, or enforce E.O. 13690 entitled \"Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input,\" until certain conditions are met.  If enacted, this provision would undermine Federal agencies' ability to protect Federal investments and could make communities more vulnerable to flood risks.  Public-Private Competition.  The Administration opposes elimination of the moratorium on public-private competition between Government employees and private sector contractors to perform commercial activities that support agency missions.  OMB continues to work with agencies on efforts to ensure the most effective mix of Federal employees and contractors and believes more time is needed for efforts to ensure core in-house capabilities for critical functions take effect before the moratorium is lifted.  The Administration urges the Congress to continue the moratorium in FY 2017, as proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request.  Delayed Implementation of E.O. 13673.  The Administration objects to section 640, which would delay implementation of E.O. 13673 entitled \"Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces,\" until the Government Accountability Office conducts a comprehensive study on the effects of the E.O. and the Secretary of Labor certifies that the benefits of the order outweigh any costs.  Such a delay is unnecessary and would forestall implementation of important safeguards established by the President to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not reward corporations that break labor laws and thereby jeopardize the performance and cost of Federal contracting.  Over the nearly two years since the E.O. was issued, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council and the Department of Labor have conducted a measured and highly deliberative process to implement the E.O., which included publication of a proposed rule and guidance in May 2015 that generated nearly 20,000 public comments.  Any final rule would need to be accompanied by a comprehensive regulatory impact analysis that responds to public comments and explains, among other things, how the rule improves economy and efficiency and the alternatives that were considered to minimize burden on small businesses.  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funded the FY 2017 Budget request for OPM and the National Archives and Records Administration to develop U.S. Digital Service teams.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to fully 9  fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Department of the Treasury, GSA, and SBA to develop their U.S. Digital Service teams.  This funding supports efforts to improve digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.  Constitutional Concerns  Several provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns, including sections 204 and 205, relating to the President's authority to execute and interpret Federal laws, including the Constitution; section 621, relating to the President's authority to supervise and oversee the Executive Branch; and section 713, relating to the disclosure of certain classified and other privileged information.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  10  ", "The Administration is focused every day on what can be done to expand opportunity for every American.  In today's economy, that means building a first-class transportation system that attracts first-class jobs and takes American businesses' goods all across the world.  The Nation needs a multi-year authorization bill that makes significant and long-term investments in infrastructure.  It is time for the Congress to end the era of short-term patches and chronic underinvestment.  The Administration will not support continued failure in making the investments the Nation needs. The Administration expects that the Congress will use this two-month extension to make meaningful and demonstrable progress towards a significant bill in 2015. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress towards this end.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports measures to make the Nation's tax code fairer and simpler for middle-class and working families.  The President's Budget includes a number of proposals that would streamline existing tax breaks and provide additional tax relief to millions of families, helping paychecks go further to cover the cost of child care, college, and a secure retirement.  The President's proposals are fully paid for primarily by closing tax loopholes for the highest-income Americans.  However, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 622, which would permanently extend the tax deduction for State and local sales taxes without offsetting the cost, adding to long-term deficits.  Current law allows taxpayers who itemize to claim a deduction for State and local sales taxes, in lieu of a deduction for State and local income taxes.  By making permanent the deduction for State and local sales taxes, H.R. 622 would add $42 billion to the deficit over the next ten years.  The bill violates the very standard that House Republicans approved just last month in their budget resolution, which requires offsetting the cost of any tax extenders that are made permanent with other revenue measures. As with other similar proposals, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the deficit to continue costly tax breaks, while slashing investments and programs that serve middle-class and working Americans in the name of fiscal rectitude.  If this same, unprecedented approach of making certain traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits over the next ten years, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.  House Republicans are also making clear their priorities by rushing to make costly tax extenders permanent and provide hundreds of billions of dollars of additional tax cuts for a few multi-million dollar estates, even as the House Republican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 26 million working families and students by letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and education tax credits expire. The Administration wants to work with the Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen the economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax reform.  However, H.R. 622 represents the wrong approach.  If the President were presented with H.R. 622, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 685, which would weaken key consumer protections and provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.   A fundamental component of Wall Street Reform is its requirement that lenders, before extending mortgage loans, make reasonable, good faith determinations that mortgage borrowers have the ability to repay the loans.  The law provides lenders with protection from liability under this requirement if their loans satisfy certain clear criteria and thus are \"Qualified Mortgages.\"  One of the criteria is that the up-front costs (\"points and fees\") not exceed three percent of the total loan amount.  During the housing bubble, many lenders front-loaded mortgage loans with points and fees and therefore had less incentive to determine a borrower\u2019s ability to repay.  Moreover, excessive, front-loaded points and fees contributed to predatory lending behavior, \"steering\" borrowers into more expensive mortgage loans.   H.R. 685 would revise the Truth in Lending Act to allow certain charges to be excluded from the definition of points and fees even when the lender or its affiliates receives the fees.  By exempting certain fees from the three percent cap, H.R. 685 would allow lenders to increase the cost of loans and still be eligible for \"Qualified Mortgage\" treatment.  This revision risks eroding consumer protections and returning the mortgage market to the days of careless lending focused on short-term profits. Because H.R. 685 would weaken key consumer protections and provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, if the President were presented with H.R. 685, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.    * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration\u2019s proposal provides a focused approach to incentivize more cybersecurity information sharing while ensuring the protection of privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties.  As the Administration has previously stated, information sharing legislation must carefully safeguard privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties, preserve the long-standing respective roles and missions of civilian and intelligence agencies, and provide for appropriate sharing with targeted liability protections.  The Administration is encouraged by the strong bipartisan support for cybersecurity information sharing legislation in the Congress.    The Administration appreciates that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence adopted several amendments to S. 754 to address some of the Administration's most significant concerns and is further encouraged that the bill\u2019s sponsor has proposed additional changes on the Senate floor.  This work has strengthened the legislation and incorporated important modifications to better protect privacy.  As such, the Administration supports Senate passage of S. 754, while continuing to work with the Congress as S.754 moves through the legislative process to ensure further important changes are made to the bill, including, but not limited to, preserving the leadership of civilian agencies in domestic cybersecurity.    The Administration supports S. 754\u2019s requirement that an entity sharing information with the Federal Government must share that information through the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in order to receive liability protections.  Moreover, S. 754 requires that such sharing be governed by privacy protection guidelines and that DHS must further disseminate such information in real-time with other Federal agencies.  The Administration supports real-time sharing amongst Federal agencies with appropriate privacy protections, and is currently developing such a capability at DHS.  Focusing real-time sharing through one center at DHS enhances situational awareness, facilitates robust privacy controls, and helps to ensure oversight of such sharing.  In addition, centralizing this sharing mechanism through DHS will facilitate more effective real-time sharing with other agencies in the most efficient manner.    Therefore, in order to ensure a focused approach and to facilitate streamlined information sharing while ensuring robust privacy protections, the Administration will strongly oppose any amendments that would provide additional liability-protected sharing channels, including expanding any exceptions to the DHS portal.  In addition, the Administration remains concerned that the bill\u2019s authorization to share with any Federal entity, notwithstanding any other provision of law, weakens the bill\u2019s requirement that information be shared with a civilian entity.  This  remains a significant concern, and the Administration is eager to work with the Congress to seek a workable solution.    S. 754 authorizes the use of certain potentially disruptive defensive measures in response to network incidents, provisions that were not included in the Administration\u2019s proposal.  The use of defensive measures raises significant legal, policy, and diplomatic concerns and, without appropriate safeguards, can have a direct deleterious impact on foreign policy, the integrity of information systems, and cybersecurity.  The Administration is encouraged, however, that the bill\u2019s sponsor has proposed changes that would limit an entity from employing a defensive measure that would provide it unauthorized access to another entity\u2019s network.  Though the Administration remains concerned that the bill\u2019s authorization to operate defensive measures may prevent the application of other laws such as State common-law tort remedies, it is encouraged that the additional changes will help to appropriately constrain the use of defensive measures.  The Administration is committed to continue working with stakeholders to address remaining concerns.  The Administration commends the Committee for recognizing that cybersecurity requires a whole-of-government approach and that information must be appropriately shared within the Federal Government.  This sharing must be consistent with certain narrow cybersecurity use restrictions, as well as privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties protections and transparent oversight.  The Administration commends the Committee for requiring that intra-governmental sharing be governed by a set of policies and procedures developed by the Federal Government to protect privacy and civil liberties.  The Administration is encouraged that the bill\u2019s sponsor has proposed changes that would preserve the Federal Government\u2019s ability to implement privacy protective policies and procedures.  The Administration is encouraged by changes the bill\u2019s sponsor has proposed to ensure that information sharing provided for in the bill is narrowly focused on the important purpose of this bill, the protection of information systems and information from cybersecurity threats and security vulnerabilities.  Finally, the Administration is pleased that S.754 includes provisions that will improve the cybersecurity of Federal networks and systems.  Consistent with the bill\u2019s requirements, the Administration will implement this authority in a manner that both enhances cybersecurity and continues to protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of Federal agencies\u2019 data.  Information sharing is one piece of a larger suite of legislation needed to provide the private sector, the Federal Government, and law enforcement with the necessary tools to combat cyber threats, and create for consumers and businesses a strong and consistent notification standard for breaches of personal data.  In addition to updating information sharing statutes, the Congress should incorporate privacy, confidentiality protection, and civil liberties safeguards into all aspects of cybersecurity legislation.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3134 and H.R. 3504 because the bills, while different, would have the same consequence of limiting women\u2019s health care choices.    H.R. 3134 would defund Planned Parenthood based on its provision of abortion services.  Planned Parenthood uses both Federal and non-Federal funds to provide a range of important preventive care and health services, including health screenings, vaccinations, and check-ups to millions of men and women who visit their health centers annually. Longstanding Federal policy already prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  By eliminating Federal funding for a major provider of health care, H.R. 3134 would limit access to health care for men, women, and families across the Nation, and would disproportionately impact low-income individuals.    H.R. 3504 would impose new legal requirements related to the provision of abortion services in certain circumstances, which would likely have a chilling effect, reducing access to care.  If the President were presented with H.R. 3134 or H.R. 3504, he would veto them.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration's highest priority is to ensure the safety and security of the American people. That is why refugees of all nationalities, including Syrians and Iraqis, considered for admission to the United States undergo the most rigorous and thorough security screening of anyone admitted into the United States.  This legislation would introduce unnecessary and impractical requirements that would unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist some of the most vulnerable people in the world, many of whom are victims of terrorism, and would undermine our partners in the Middle East and Europe in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis.  The Administration therefore strongly opposes H.R. 4038.  The current screening process involves multiple Federal intelligence, security, and law enforcement agencies, including the National Counterterrorism Center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), State, and Defense, all aimed at ensuring that those admitted do not pose a threat to our country.  These safeguards include biometric (fingerprint) and biographic checks, medical screenings, and a lengthy interview by specially trained DHS officers who scrutinize the applicant's explanation of individual circumstances to assess whether the applicant meets statutory requirements to qualify as a refugee and that he or she does not present security concerns to the United States.  Mindful of the particular conditions of the Syria crisis, Syrian refugees \u2013 who have had their lives uprooted by conflict and continue to live amid conditions so harsh that many set out on dangerous, often deadly, journeys seeking new places of refuge \u2013 go through additional forms of security screening, including a thorough pre-interview analysis of each individual's refugee application.  Additionally, DHS interviewers receive extensive, Syria-specific training before meeting with refugee applicants.  Of the 2,174 Syrian refugees admitted to the United States since September 11, 2001, not a single one has been arrested or deported on terrorism-related grounds.  The certification requirement at the core of H.R. 4038 is untenable and would provide no meaningful additional security for the American people, instead serving only to create significant delays and obstacles in the fulfillment of a vital program that satisfies both humanitarian and national security objectives.  No refugee is approved for travel to the United States under the current system until the full array of required security vetting measures have been completed. Thus, the substantive result sought through this draft legislation is already embedded into the program. The Administration recognizes the importance of a strong, evolving security screening in our refugee admissions program and devotes considerable resources to continually improving the Nation's robust security screening protocols.  The measures called for in this bill would divert resources from these efforts.    Given the lives at stake and the critical importance to our partners in the Middle East and Europe of American leadership in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis, if the President were presented  with H.R. 4038, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 954.  The Administration remains committed to providing Americans with accessible, quality, and affordable health coverage, including by addressing issues that arise when their health insurers stop offering coverage during the year.  In such circumstances, the Administration has offered special enrollment periods, provided consumer outreach, and worked with state departments of insurance to ensure consumers have smooth transitions to other health plans.  Individuals for whom coverage is unaffordable or who experience a hardship also may quality for an exemption from the individual-responsibility provision of the law.  These options are available to all consumers in these circumstances, not just those enrolled in coverage through CO-OPs.  H.R. 954 would exempt anyone whose CO-OP ends coverage during the year from the individual-responsibility provision.  This is unnecessary given consumer protections already available.  Moreover, it would create a bad precedent for using exemptions from the individual-responsibility provision to address unrelated concerns about the Affordable Care Act.  The individual-responsibility provision is a necessary part of a system that prohibits discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions and requires guaranteed issuance.  The provision helps prevent people from waiting until they get sick to buy health insurance or dropping health insurance when they believe they do not need it.  Weakening the individual responsibility provision would increase health insurance premiums and decrease the number of Americans with coverage.  The Administration always is willing to work with the Congress on fiscally responsible ways to further improve health care affordability and the Affordable Care Act.  The President's Budget offers a number of proposals to do so.  However, H.R. 954 would be a step in the wrong direction, because it would create a precedent that undermines a key part of the law and would do nothing to help middle-class families obtain affordable health care.    If the President were presented with H.R. 954, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee's continued support of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in S. 2943, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017.  The Administration also appreciates that S. 2943, as reported by the Committee, would authorize resources to support our troops in a manner that is consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 without relying on budgetary gimmicks that risk the safety of our service members and undercut stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars.  Of particular note are provisions supporting the Administration's pay raise and force structure requests.  As the bill is considered by the Senate, it is critical that the Congress adhere to the principle that any increase in funding must be shared equally between defense and non-defense \u2013 a central tenet of last fall's budget agreement.  The Administration strongly objects to many provisions in this bill that would hinder the Department of Defense's (DOD) ability to execute the President's defense strategy and the Administration's ability to carry out national security and foreign policy.  Specifically, the bill attempts to micromanage DOD by impeding the Department's ability to respond to changing circumstances, directing overly prescriptive organizational changes, preventing the closure of Guantanamo, and limiting U.S. engagement with Cuba, and includes provisions that set an arbitrary limit on the size of the President's National Security Council staff.  The bill would undermine expert judgments of the Department's civilian and military leadership and constrain the ability of the President and the Secretary of Defense to appropriately manage and direct the Nation's defense.   Reorganizing DOD without careful study and consideration would undermine the Department's ability to continue to carry out its national security functions, and comes at a dangerous time, with U.S. forces deployed across the globe, including as part of the Counter-ISIL campaign and NATO mission in Afghanistan.  S. 2943 would restructure key parts of DOD in ways that have not been thoroughly reviewed by experts, either within or outside the Department, and that are likely to make the Department less efficient and agile.  For example, it would dissolve the Office of the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD/AT&L) and replace it with failed models of the past.  USD/AT&L has a track record of improved acquisition performance for the taxpayer since the implementation of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (WSARA) and the Better Buying Power initiatives of 2010 to the present.  The bill would create dysfunctional partitions across DOD's research, engineering, procurement, and sustainment systems that will make it harder to sustain the Department's improved performance.  The bill would reverse key aspects of WSARA, which reinforced early attention to requirements, cost and schedule estimates, testing, and reliability.  The bill also would insert a civilian, other than the President or the Secretary of Defense, into the administrative chain of command for the first time.  Simultaneously, it would direct the establishment of cross- functional entities, which in many cases already exist, but, if structured as the bill requires, would undermine the authority of the Secretary, add bureaucracy, and confuse lines of responsibility.    The bill includes other troubling provisions affecting the Department.  For example, it would rigidly prescribe the use of a wide range of contracting methods in circumstances that history has proven are not appropriate or efficient in meeting the military's needs.  It would direct wholesale reorganization of military medical treatment facilities, which would jeopardize the readiness of military healthcare providers to carry out wartime missions.  It would prescribe onerous, across-the-board cuts to senior military billets, civilian executives, and contractors at a time when the Department is already undertaking a 25 percent cut to headquarters activities and other significant reforms to become leaner and more efficient.  The bill also would impair personnel policies, such as parental leave and housing allowances, which are important to supporting the force \u2013 particularly female service members.  These personnel changes would harm the Department's ability to recruit and retain the high-quality service members that our all-volunteer force requires.  In addition, S. 2943 would impose unneeded costs, constraining DOD's ability to balance military capability, capacity, and readiness, including by failing to authorize a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.  The bill continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay and adds new provisions, attempting to dictate how the Executive Branch conducts foreign policy and requiring the disclosure of sensitive national security information.  The Administration also objects to the inclusion of non-germane provisions, such as those exempting defense contractors from an Executive Order (EO) that ensures that agencies are identifying and working with contractors with track records of compliance with labor laws.  These provisions have nothing to do with the national security of our country, and decrease the economy and efficiency of the Federal procurement system.  Furthermore, the Administration strongly objects to efforts to limit our engagement with Cuba, curtailing the normalization of our relationship.  The Administration is also concerned that, in addition to lacking defense and non-defense parity, expected attempts to increase funding for defense accounts will fail to reflect the highest joint priorities of the Department, ensure programmatic stability and continuity and contribute to improvements in the readiness of the joint force, rather than exacerbate readiness challenges.   If the President were presented with S. 2943, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below, and urges the Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to make necessary changes to the bill.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the bill's classified annex and working with the Committee to address any concerns on classified programs.  Guantanamo Detainee Provisions:  The Administration strongly objects to several provisions of the bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  As the Administration has said many times before, the continued operation of the facility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  In February, the Administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter of our history to a close.  Rather than taking the steps necessary to close the facility, this bill 2  includes several provisions that would seek to extend its operation.  While some provisions represent an improvement over current law by authorizing additional flexibility in some circumstances, the bill fails to eliminate the unwarranted limitations on the transfer of detainees, including the onerous restrictions that currently constrain the transfer of detainees to foreign countries, and introduces additional problematic restrictions that would impede closure of the facility.   Among the onerous, unwarranted and harmful provisions, section 1029 would prohibit the transfer of detainees to numerous countries on the basis of State Department travel warnings, which are designed for the unrelated purpose of conveying information to individual tourists and other travelers about potential dangers associated with travel to those countries.  These warnings do not reflect a country's ability to mitigate potential risk with regard to transferred detainees or serve as an appropriate substitute for the Administration's careful and individualized assessment based on all relevant facts and circumstances of the capability of potential receiving countries to successfully reintegrate detainees and implement appropriate security measures.      In addition, section 1027 would require the Secretary of Defense to provide to the Congress prior to any transfer a memorandum of understanding containing diplomatic assurances from the foreign nation to which the detainee would be transferred.  Across two administrations, the Executive Branch has consistently informed the Congress and represented before U.S. courts that disclosing such diplomatic assurances from foreign governments would reduce the willingness of these and potentially other countries to cooperate with the United States on a range of matters.  Section 1027 would also require the disclosure of sensitive national security information not only to the Congress, but to the very nation that is the subject of the assessment.  Further, section 1028 could require the Secretary of Defense to provide the Congress with classified, sensitive national security information about detainees, in unclassified form.    The President has objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation.  Further, the provisions concerning detainee transfers could raise several constitutional concerns.  In certain circumstances, sections 1021, 1026, 1027, and 1029 would violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  Sections 1026 and 1029 could, in some circumstances, interfere with the ability to transfer a detainee who has been granted a writ of habeas corpus.  And, as explained, sections 1027 and 1028 could require the disclosure of privileged information.  The Administration would treat these provisions consistent with the President's constitutional authority in these areas.  Restriction of the Size and Function of the National Security Council (NSC) Staff:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1089, which would place an arbitrary limitation of 150 professional NSC staff, which assists the President by coordinating national security policy across the many departments and agencies in the Executive branch.  By contrast, the combined staff of the Senate Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Homeland Security, and Intelligence Committees is larger than 150 people.  This provision would radically restructure the NSC staff, requiring an arbitrary reduction in personnel that could inhibit the NSC staff's ability to advise and assist the President as he carries out his national security and foreign policy agenda in an increasingly complicated world.  Indeed, the NSC staff includes a number of positions that were added after a 2009 review recommended the creation of additional directorates and positions to address emerging threats and challenges, such as cybersecurity and weapons of mass destruction-related terrorism.  Arbitrarily reducing the size of the NSC staff could impede the NSC staff's ability to coordinate interagency policy and advise and assist the President on these important 3  issues.  Moreover, this Administration has already actively sought to ensure appropriate NSC staff levels, reducing the staff by 12 percent in the last eighteen months.  Elimination of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD/AT&L):  The Administration strongly objects to section 901, which would eliminate the USD/AT&L and assign its duties to multiple officials, including a new Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, an Under Secretary for Management Support, and an Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Policy and Oversight.  Unlike the USD/AT&L, the new Under Secretary for Research and Engineering would not have responsibility for developmental testing, which provides critical feedback regarding the early identification of design problems that is crucial for successful acquisition programs.  The new Under Secretary would not have responsibility for contractor oversight and life-cycle sustainment costs, which would undermine DOD's ability to control contractor costs and oversee performance through the life of a program.  And the new Under Secretary would not have the authority to direct the military departments and DOD components, undermining the ability of the Secretary of Defense to provide guidance and direction to the military services on major acquisition programs.  Finally, the assignment of logistics oversight functions to both a new Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Sustainment under the new Assistant Secretary for Acquisition Policy and Oversight and a new Under Secretary of Defense for Business Management would fracture and misalign logistics authorities, management, and execution and ignore the key logistics authorities and policies related to deploying, sustaining, and retrograding forces in contingency operations.  Taken together, these changes would roll back the acquisition reforms of the last two decades and risk returning the Department to an era in which overly optimistic cost estimates, inadequate system engineering and developmental testing, inappropriate reliance on immature technologies, ineffective contractor management, and lack of focus on life-cycle costs by the military departments led to explosive cost growth and the failure of multiple major defense acquisition programs.  It is particularly inappropriate for the Congress to do this now, when the data clearly shows that recent performance of the Department's acquisition system has improved markedly in recent years.  For example, the proportion of major programs projecting funding savings below baseline has risen from 29 percent to 57 percent in development, and 44 percent to 79 percent in unit procurement, between the 2009 and 2014 Selected Acquisition Reports.  Many of the reforms accomplished under WSARA and the Better Buying Power initiatives of 2010 to the present would be overturned just as compelling evidence that they are succeeding has become available.  Undermining DOD Organization and Structure:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 941 and 942, which would undermine the Secretary of Defense's ability to exercise authority, direction, and control over the Department.  The provisions would blur lines of responsibility and control over resources within the Department, and would require the issuance of numerous unnecessary and burdensome policies, directives, and reports.  Section 941 would undermine the Secretary's ability to create effective cross-functional teams, which are already an extremely common feature of the way the Department is organized today.  For example, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, the Defense Acquisition Board, the 3-Star Programmers, the Global Posture Executive Council, and the Deputy's Management Action Group are all chartered cross-functional organizations at the heart of the Department's core functions.  These sections would limit the Secretary's ability to use teams such as these by mandating an inflexible legislative schedule for the establishment of such teams and requiring that the teams write their own charters.  Section 941 also would give directive authority over other elements of the Department and authorize them to requisition personnel and resources from other parts of the 4  Department without regard to competing mission requirements.  Furthermore, by directing the Department to enter into contracts with outside consultants to obtain advice on the performance of the teams, this provision is squarely at odds with section 905, which would require considerable cuts to contractors in the Department.  Section 941 would also prohibit the nomination of an individual to a senior DOD position unless the individual has successfully completed a course in \"leadership, modern organizational practice, collaboration, and the operation of mission teams.\"  Sections 941 and 942 would require the Secretary to establish two separate comprehensive organizational strategies with overlapping and not always consistent requirements and different reporting requirements.  Contrary to the stated objective of the legislation, these provisions would establish new processes and new paperwork burdens, resulting in increased bureaucracy and a larger, less efficient, and less responsive DOD organization.   Organization of the Department of Defense for Management of Special Operations Forces and Special Operations:  The Administration objects to section 923, which would insert an Assistant Secretary into the administrative chain of command for the first time since the enactment of the National Security Act of 1947, displacing the Service Secretaries.  This provision would also amend the responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict to include assisting the Secretary and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy in the development and supervision of policy, program planning and execution, and allocation and use of resources for the activities of the Department for countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (CWMD).  These CWMD responsibilities currently reside under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security.  Finally, this provision would intrude on the authority and the prerogative of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy to manage the organization to provide the best support to the Secretary and the President.   Realignment of Director of Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E):  The Administration strongly objects to section 894, which would realign the Director of DT&E under the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E).  DT&E is part of the acquisition process and provides insight into managing risks, measuring technical progress, and characterizing technical performance during development.  Independent of the acquisition process, DOT&E provides an assessment that characterizes a weapons system's operational effectiveness, suitability, and survivability.  Therefore, DOT&E performs oversight that is singularly focused on testing, without regard for the fiscal and schedule realities of DOD acquisition. The realignment of DT&E under DOT&E would eliminate this separation, undermine a program manager's authorities and responsibilities, and drive increases in program cost and schedule by severely impacting the services' ability to plan and execute developmental test and evaluation strategies within the framework of the DOD acquisition process.  U.S.-Cuba Military Engagement:  The Administration strongly objects to the additional restrictions that would be placed on U.S.-Cuban military-to-military interactions.  The proposed restriction would hamper pragmatic, expert-level coordination between the United States and Cuba on issues that benefit the United States.  For example, the Commanding Officer of U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay and his Cuban counterpart meet monthly to share information about activities on both sides of the fence to reduce the risk of accidental escalation.  While section 1204 carves out an exception for exercises and operations related to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, it does not provide an exception or waiver for counter-narcotics.  In addition, section 1204 limits the ability of the Secretary of Defense to invite, assist, or assure the 5  participation of the Government of Cuba in security conferences, where much of the multilateral preparatory work on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and counter-narcotics takes place.  It is in the U.S. national security interest to maintain flexibility in U.S. military-to-military engagement with Cuba due to Cuba's proximity and the many shared challenges faced by the United States and Cuba.  Prohibition on Conducting Additional BRAC Round:   The Administration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can make better use of scarce resources.  Maintaining excess infrastructure is costly and wasteful, and it deprives the Department of the ability to reallocate scarce resources to address readiness, modernization, and other national security requirements.   In addition to addressing every previous Congressional objection to BRAC authorization, the Department recently conducted a DOD-wide parametric capacity analysis which demonstrated that the Department has 22 percent excess capacity.  Additionally, the Administration's BRAC legislative proposal includes several changes that respond to Congressional concerns regarding cost.  Specifically, the revised BRAC legislation requires the Secretary to certify that BRAC will have the primary objective of eliminating excess capacity and reducing costs; emphasizes recommendations that yield net savings within five years (subject to military value); and limits recommendations that take longer than 20 years to pay back.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested.  Modification of National Missile Defense Policy:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support for the Nation's ballistic missile defense programs.  However, the Administration strongly objects to section 1665, which would amend section 2 of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-38; 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2431) by striking \u2018limited.'  The inclusion of this word is specifically intended to convey that the U.S. homeland missile defense system is designed and deployed to counter limited attacks (in number and sophistication) from Iran and North Korea, and not to counter the strategic deterrence forces of Russia and China.  The Administration continues to believe that the most reliable and effective means to deter major nuclear powers from ever contemplating an attack on the United States is by maintaining a modern and robust strategic nuclear deterrent force.  Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF):  The Administration strongly objects to the elimination of CTPF in section 4502, which would remove a valuable tool for partnership-focused approaches to counterterrorism.  Cutting CTPF would greatly reduce the Administration's flexibility to provide counterterrorism assistance to foreign partners.  The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to authorize the $1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2017.   TRICARE Reform:  The Administration greatly appreciates the Committee's meaningful TRICARE benefit reforms in sections 701 and 702, which closely resemble those included in the President's Budget.  However, the Administration is disappointed that the legislation does not include a modest enrollment fee for TRICARE for Life and phases in TRICARE Choice enrollment fees for non-Medicare eligible retirees over five years.  Together, these elements of the Administration's proposal would provide nearly $2.6 billion in additional savings over a five -year period.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fully adopt the benefit reform provisions submitted with the President's Budget.  The Administration is also very concerned about section 726, which has the potential to cause serious program disruption and induce high additional costs derived from the unintended consequence of further complicating health care 6  contract acquisition processes to comply with its detailed legislative mandates.  The section would include a provision on continuous competition, allowing \"automatic renewal\" of the managed care contracts for up to 10 years, but then would prohibit the incumbent from rebidding on the successor contract.  It also would allow either party to terminate the contract with 180 days' notice.  Either provision could result in large geographic areas losing their TRICARE managed care contracts, severely limiting beneficiary access to civilian care.  The multi-billion dollar TRICARE management contracts require substantial acquisition process time, compliance with many statutory requirements, and robust transition periods between contractors.  As written, responsible implementation of this section is not feasible.  Military Health System Reform:  The Administration strongly objects to section 721, which would radically restructure the military health system.  The language severs the relationship between each Service and its medical department, jeopardizing the ability of the Department to readily provide operational medical support.  It also would separate the accountability for medical support to military missions and the responsibility for the quality of care from operational missions.  Both functions are critically important to maintain the documented success in saving lives on the battlefield.  The Defense Health Agency is both a DOD entity and a Combat Support Agency; however, when working operational support issues, there is considerable difference between having an accountable leader with knowledge of the mission in the Service chain of command versus a leader outside of that chain, as provided by section 721.  The Department agrees that standardization of common clinical and business processes will lead to more effective and efficient care, and commits to substantially accelerating achievement of a common, enterprise approach consistent with the Services' operational readiness requirements. The Department looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that the Military Health System provides state-of-the-art, quality care to all it serves, on and off the battlefield, while maintaining critical readiness capability to support the military mission.   Modifications to the Newly-Created Military Retirement System:  The Administration appreciates the flexibility provided by sections 631-633 in connection with retired pay reform and urges the Congress to support the use of continuation pay for service members with up to 16 years of service, given varying retention rates across career fields and the military departments.  However, the Administration is concerned about mandating a 2.5 monthly basic pay multiplier for continuation pay for all members.  Allowing DOD greater flexibility to adjust the timing and amount of continuation pay would allow military services to shape the force more effectively and efficiently.   Restructure of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH):  The Administration strongly objects to section 604, which would undermine the existing structure of BAH, return the allowance to its distorted state from the mid-1990s, and reinstitute a burdensome and inefficient administrative-authorization process by limiting BAH payments to actual expenses.  It would also undermine the structure by basing the allowance solely on grade and location (disregarding dependency status), and would inappropriately penalize some service members over others by linking their BAH payments to their status as members of dual-military couples (members married to other members).  Section 604 would disproportionately affect female service members and those military families in which both military members have chosen to serve their country (20 percent of the women on active duty are in a dual-military marriage, compared with 3.8 percent of active duty men).  Both members of a dual-military couple would be provided a lesser compensation package than other members of equal grade, sending a message that their service is not as highly valued.  It would similarly penalize members who choose to share housing with other members 7  and thus would inhibit the ability of junior service members to obtain suitable housing in tight rental markets, which is currently a recurring concern.  Also, section 604 would hurt the recruitment and retention of high-quality service members and their families, making it difficult to sustain the all-volunteer force.  Finally, the changes would also impact benefits under multiple VA educational assistance programs that are based on BAH rates, potentially decreasing payment amounts, increasing the complexity of benefit calculations, and negatively impacting the timeliness of benefit delivery.  Military Leave:  The Administration objects to section 532, which would diminish the plenary authority of the Secretary of Defense and undermine his ability to manage the force.  The Administration urges the Congress to support DOD's military leave proposal, which strikes the right balance between parental benefits and sustaining readiness.  Additionally, the terms \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregiver are used throughout the bill language without legislative definition.  Given the myriad family situations in the force, the Department does not believe that these terms can be defined in a manner that creates a workable construct for implementing and administering the provision.   Headquarters Workforce Limitations:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 904 and 905, which would impose new restrictions on the size of the civilian and contracted services workforces for DOD headquarters.  In accordance with the requirements of section 346 of the FY 2016 NDAA, DOD has re-baselined its major headquarters activities and put in place a comprehensive plan to achieve a 25 percent reduction in the size of headquarters by FY 2020.  The Department believes that the imposition of additional limitations on subcategories of headquarters and the revival of old and inconsistent headquarters definitions would add unnecessary bureaucratic requirements, further complicate the mission of reducing headquarters, and reduce the Department's capacity to respond to emergent mission changes and requirements.  With the ongoing reductions and the many other reform efforts the Department has undertaken since 2008, we believe the Department's headquarters will be right-sized, given the tremendous breadth and depth of the Department's mission.  Further cuts must be targeted, designed to reduce specific identified redundancies or inefficiencies, or come with commensurate reductions in the Department's mission.    Reduction in General Officer and Flag Officer Grades and Positions:  While the Administration supports simplifying and improving command and control of the military, particularly where the number of four-star positions have made headquarters either top-heavy or less efficient, it objects to section 501, which would arbitrarily reduce the number of general and flag officers by 25 percent by the end of calendar year 2017.  Reductions to the number of general and flag officer positions should be made deliberately after reviewing the role of each position and analyzing the impact of the reduction on the force.  The Administration intends to reduce the number of four-star positions and across-the-board mandated reductions would degrade the effectiveness and readiness of the force.      Limitation on Number of Senior Executive Service (SES) Employees:  The Administration objects to section 1112, which would make a mandatory, 25 percent across-the-board reduction in the number of the Department's SES employees by January 1, 2019.  The Administration supports the elimination of unnecessary and excessive executive positions as evidenced by DOD's elimination of 97 SES positions in 2011, and a further reduction of over 140 SES positions since then.  However, any further reductions to SES positions in DOD should be made in a deliberate manner following a review and analysis of the impact of such reductions on the 8  functioning of each component or agency.  Requiring DOD to arbitrarily cut additional SES positions across-the-board would create long-term negative impacts for various DOD services and organizations.  Coalition Support Fund:  The Administration appreciates the extension of authority and funds associated with section 1212(f) of the FY 2016 NDAA.  Pakistan Security Enhancement Authorization:  The Administration welcomes this authority to support security and stability in Pakistan, particularly in the Federally-Administered Tribal Areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  However, the Administration objects to subsection (d) of section 1214, which would make Pakistan ineligible for the Secretary of Defense's waiver authority unless the Secretary provides a certification to the congressional defense committees.  We share the Committee's concerns regarding the threat posed to our forces and interests in Afghanistan by the Haqqani Network, and we continue to engage with Pakistan at the highest levels regarding the need for concerted action specifically against the group.  However, the restriction in subsection (d) would unnecessarily complicate progress in our bilateral relationship on this issue and would limit the Secretary of Defense's ability to act in the U.S. national security interest.   Security Cooperation Enterprise Reforms:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's efforts to reform DOD's security cooperation enterprise in subtitle G of Title XII, particularly certain Administration requested reform proposals.  The bill also proposes far-reaching reforms in a number of areas to enhance the transparency and oversight of security sector resources, professionalize the workforce, and improve the alignment of authorities to defense strategy.  While these proposed reforms seek to address a number of existing challenges in the current framework, they go beyond the Administration's request with potentially broad ramifications that need to be analyzed carefully.  Any reforms ultimately must ensure that no harm is done to DOD's current security cooperation and force readiness efforts, or to the State Department's lead role in foreign policy and security sector assistance, including by inappropriately codifying, expanding, limiting, or eliminating current authorities, resources, or mechanisms necessary to ensure that the United States pursues a coherent and consistent foreign policy through all assistance activities.  In addition, this consolidation could undermine DOD's ability to support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.   Foreign policy and security cooperation authorities must continue to strike a balance between specific defense initiatives and broader foreign policy priorities.  The bill's expansion of existing security cooperation authorities must continue to preserve or include requested mechanisms for ensuring State Department foreign policy direction, including joint formulation.  The Administration is eager to work with the Committee, and with the Congress, to ensure the final legislation undertakes Administration-requested reforms in a carefully considered manner that avoids duplication of efforts and authorities, and unintended consequences for current DOD and State security sector assistance activities. Prohibition on Use of Funds for Certain DOD Programs and Projects in Afghanistan that Cannot be Safely Accessed by United States Government Personnel:  The Administration objects to the language included in section 1213, which would adversely affect two key assistance programs -- the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) and the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP).  DOD cannot predict or guarantee the future security environment in the vicinity of every program and project that is funded by CERP or ASFF, which are often used to fund multi-year programs and projects.  As a result, DOD would potentially be required to seek a 9  waiver for every program and project -- a burdensome requirement that could negatively affect DOD's ability to address urgent needs of the local population, interrupt or slow down training and sustainment programs, and delay funding the critical needs of the Afghanistan National Security and Defense Forces at a time when insurgent forces are leveraging every opportunity to threaten Afghanistan's security.   Multiple Provisions Imposing Restrictions on the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Program:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1036, 1037, 1038, and 1611.  Section 1036 would restrict DOD's authority to use RD-180 engines, eliminate the Secretary's authority to waive restrictions to protect national security interests, and -- with section 1037 -- disqualify a domestic launch service provider from offering a competitive, certified launch service capability.  Section 1038 would repeal the statutory requirement to allow all certified providers to compete for launch service procurements.  Section 1611 would redirect funds away from the development of modern, cost-effective, domestic launch capabilities that will replace non-allied engines.  The combined effect of these provisions would be to eliminate price-based competition of EELV launch service contracts starting in FY 2017, force the Department to allocate missions, inhibit DOD's ability to maintain assured access to space, delay the launch of national security satellites, delay the on-ramp of new domestic launch capabilities and services, and increase the cost of space launch to DOD, the Intelligence Community, and civil agencies. The authorization to use up to 18 RD-180 engines is necessary and prudent to expeditiously and affordably transition to the new domestic launch capabilities currently under development.    Transition of Air Force Operation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) to Enlisted Personnel:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1046, which would require the Air Force to transition all RPA operations to an organizational model that uses enlisted personnel for the preponderance of RPA operations by September 30, 2019.  Over the last decade, the demand for RPA forces has grown dramatically, and various factors have resulted in undesirable cuts in training capacity and ultimately reduced the number of trained aviators.  To address this issue, the Air Force developed and is implementing a get-well plan that has begun correcting pilot shortfalls and increasing RPA pilot manning to achieve and sustain a healthy RPA enterprise.  Before the Congress mandates any particular manning determinations, the Air Force should be allowed to conduct a study assessing the appropriate future balance of officer-enlisted pilots/crews in the RPA enterprise and any potential impacts on future Air Force force structure.  Directing a date and percentage for integrating enlisted pilots prior to understanding the ramifications for training through-put and force management may negatively impact the entire RPA force and reduce combat capability at a time when it is beginning to create a healthy enterprise after years of continuous surge operations.   U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) Assessment of Satellite Acquisition by National Reconnaissance Office (NRO):  The Administration strongly objects to section 1606, which would require the Comptroller General to continually assess the cost, schedule, and performance of NRO programs that receive funding from the Military Intelligence Program or are supported by DOD personnel.  Such an expansive definition would require annual audits of all NRO programs, not just those funded in part by DOD.  This additional oversight would be exceptionally burdensome and unnecessarily wasteful to an agency that has received seven consecutive clean financial audits and was recently recognized by the Congress for its systems acquisitions excellence.  The current oversight regime is sufficient and appropriate, and includes the NRO Inspector General, DOD, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Inspectors General of those agencies, the Office of Management and Budget, and the 10  Congress.  Since 2011, GAO access has been administered by Intelligence Community Directive 114, which reflects an agreement between the Comptroller General and the Director of National Intelligence.  Given the sensitivity of NRO acquisitions, extensive GAO access would present security risks to the Nation's most sensitive space programs.  Limitation on Acceleration of Dismantlement of Retired Nuclear Weapons:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3113, which would place unnecessary restrictions on the ability of the President to exercise his responsibilities to manage the nuclear arsenal.  The Administration also objects to the reduction in funding for accelerated dismantlement of retired nuclear warheads.  The United States has a considerable backlog of retired warheads awaiting dismantlement that are no longer needed for military purposes.  Funding for accelerated dismantlement is important both to appropriately manage the U.S. nuclear arsenal in a safe, secure, and effective way and to demonstrate continued U.S. commitment to nonproliferation and disarmament.  Nonproliferation Construction:  The Administration strongly objects to continued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility and to section 3114 which would require yet another study of the cost and time necessary to complete this facility.  Even with a firm fixed-price contract for the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility, numerous previous studies have confirmed that the alternative disposition method is expected to be significantly faster and less expensive.  Consistently, these reviews have concluded that the projected life-cycle costs of the MOX fuel approach for plutonium disposition will be $30-$50 billion, and possibly higher, and will require approximately $800 million to $1 billion annually for decades through the life of the program.  It would be irresponsible for the Congress to require continued construction of this project, which would only serve to waste limited national security funds and force more pressing nuclear security needs to go unmet.  The already-proven alternative method of disposition is expected to be significantly faster and less expensive than the MOX approach, has far lower risks, and will begin to move plutonium out of the State of South Carolina much sooner.  The Administration also objects to section 3114, which would establish the Chief of Engineers as an owner's agent relative to the MOX Project.  Recognizing the U.S. Army Corps' (USACE) expertise, the Department of Energy is already leveraging USACE personnel on its large construction projects, including the MOX Project where USACE is augmenting project oversight and providing independent cost estimates.  Therefore, the Administration does not believe naming USACE as the owner's agent will provide additional value.  Providing Footwear to Recruits at Initial Entry Training:  The Administration objects to section 671, which would require the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to provide athletic footwear directly to recruits upon their entry into the Armed Forces instead of providing a cash allowance for the purchase of such footwear, at the choice of the recruit.  Mandating that a specific article of clothing be provided to new recruits is unprecedented and, in the case of athletic shoes, runs counter to research that indicates a strong correlation between the variety of athletic shoes available, fit, and comfort, and reduced injury rates.  Forcing DOD into a \"one size fits all\" approach to athletic footwear may contribute to a higher incidence of injury to new recruits during one of the most critical times in a member's military training.  DOD places the health of service members above all other considerations.  Because only one company is currently producing a shoe that arguably meets the standards established in the section, this provision appears to provide a preferential arrangement for a particular company.    11  Distributed Common Ground System of the Army (DCGS-A):  The Administration objects to section 111, which would restrict award of any contract for the design, development, and procurement of any data architecture, data integration, cloud capability, data analysis or data visualization and workflow capabilities unless Federal Acquisition Regulation part 12 is used,  includes firm fixed-priced procedures, and achieves initial operational capability within nine months and full operational capability within 18 months of contract award.  This provision appears to micromanage and mandates a commercial solution without regard for price, ability to support a modular open system architecture, or cost associated with proprietary software maintenance.  In practice, the provision could mandate acquisition of a system that does not fully meet required Key Performance Parameters without due consideration of integration costs and risks or schedule impacts, putting the system's affordability, functionality, and interoperability at risk.   Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T):  The Administration strongly objects to the funding authorization that reduces WIN-T by $100 million.  The reduction in funds stops the fielding of the WIN-T on-the-move networking capability to Army National Guard Brigade Combat Teams and creates a production break in WIN-T Increment 2 hardware.  The production break will lead to the loss of key subject matter experts.   Commissary Privatization Pilot Program:  The Administration supports section 661, which would include provisions that would protect and enhance the Defense commissary and exchange systems and reduce their reliance on appropriated fund support by allowing the establishment of an alternative pricing program for commissaries.  However, the Administration has concerns with the commissary privatization pilot program directed in section 662.  The Department recently issued a Request for Information (RFI), in accordance with the requirements of the FY 2016 NDAA, and will not be able to assess the willingness of private sector entities to participate in a privatization pilot program in a manner consistent with the preservation of the commissary benefit until responses to the RFI have been received and assessed.  By requiring the Department to conduct a pilot program for privatization regardless of the interest and capabilities of private sector entities, section 662 would place the commissary benefit at risk.    Establishment of an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Information:  The Administration objects to section 903, which would establish an Assistant Secretary for Information whose responsibilities would be potentially duplicative with the Principal Cyber Advisor (PCA) to the Secretary of Defense as well as the Principal Space Advisor.  While it would combine oversight of cyber policy and information technology, it would complicate, rather than improve, the oversight of U.S. Cyber Command and cyber operations, or U.S. Strategic Command and space operations, with governance of resources, acquisition, and cyber workforce policy fragmented.  It also would create a new fracture in DOD and intelligence space management between the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and the new Assistant Secretary, and potentially distract from the current Chief Information Officer's position and responsibilities.   Management of Defense Clandestine Human Intelligence Collection:  The Administration objects to section 945, which purports to establish a pilot program that would place case officers of the Defense Clandestine Service (DCS) under the control of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).  Requiring the transfer of all case officers and personnel who support case officers of the DCS to the CIA for three years is not a \"pilot,\" but is tantamount to an actual transfer of the program.  Limiting the transfer to three years would not mitigate the burdensome management challenges, disruption of operations, and potentially high costs associated with moving the 12  operating capability of the service to the CIA and then returning it back to DOD.  Further, the Administration is concerned that there could be adverse and unforeseen implications of such a transfer to the professional development of DCS staff.  DCS and CIA integrated operations are already working effectively and efficiently; a consolidation, as envisioned by the provision, is unnecessary.  For example, the DCS and CIA already exchange or embed personnel for planning, management, coordination, execution of operations, and development and sharing of products.   The DCS is already integrated with the CIA, as necessary and appropriate, throughout the breadth and depth of DOD and CIA clandestine operations around the world.   B-21 (Long Range Strike Bomber):  The Administration strongly objects to section 844, which would establish a critical cost threshold for the B-21 program below the acquisition program baseline (APB), which was based on two fully independent cost estimates.  This section represents an unprecedented and extremely damaging reversal of the approved acquisition strategy for the B-21 program.  To enforce a different performance standard after the execution of the acquisition strategy has begun will result in the carefully established business plan becoming mired in reporting delays and unprecedented, redundant breach certifications.  The Administration also strongly objects to the $302.3 million FY 2017 funding reduction.  There are no excess funds in the program in FY 2017 and the reduction will result in a significant delay in moving forward with the development program.  Furthermore, the Administration believes that the requirement to transfer funds to the Rapid Prototyping Fund could jeopardize the program through increased risk to the availability of funds, and the additional reporting requirements would be unnecessarily burdensome, would add schedule risk, and would detract from overall program management at a critical phase of the program.    Penalty for Use of Cost-Type Contracts/Preference for Fixed-Price Contracts:  The Administration objects to section 826, which would require the Secretary of each military department and the head of each of the defense agencies to pay a penalty for some uses of cost-type contracts that are awarded over the next five fiscal years.  Section 826 would unnecessarily constrain flexibility to tailor contract types for a given requirement.  It also creates a complex financial transaction process that, to be auditable, will require extremely burdensome procedures.  The Administration also objects to section 827, which would require higher level approval for the use of other than fixed-price contracts.  This requirement is unnecessary and would result in the Department experiencing increased costs in situations where a cost-type contract would have been more appropriate.  Acquisition officials and contracting officers should have the full range of contract types available to structure business arrangements that achieve a reasonable balance of risk between the Government and the contractor, while providing the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance.  There is extensive history that demonstrates conclusively that fixed-price development is not in the Government or industry's interest in many circumstances.  Global Positioning System Next Generation Operation Control System (GPS-OCX):  The Administration strongly objects to section 1610, which would withhold FY 2017 OCX funding until a Nunn-McCurdy certification is complete.  OCX will provide a cyber-hardened ground control network to operate the current and future GPS satellites.  Fencing off FY 2017 OCX funding will result in a stop-work for the development, test, and integration of OCX Block 0 and Block 1, resulting in a 6-12 month slip to the launch and operation of GPS III.  Additionally, the provision de-funds ongoing efforts to synchronize and modernize the GPS Enterprise, resulting in cost and schedule impacts across the space, mission control/planning, and user segments, and 13  it stops all user equipment testing, preventing the deployment of M-code capable receivers as required in Public Law 111-383, section 913.    Non-applicability of EO 13673 to DOD Contractors:  The Administration strongly objects to section 829H, which would limit DOD's application of EO 13673 (\"Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces\") only to contractors or subcontractors who have already been suspended or debarred as a result of Federal labor violations covered by the EO.  Such limited applicability would undermine broader safeguards established by the President to ensure that agencies are identifying and working with contractors with track records of compliance with labor laws, which enhances productivity and increases the likelihood of timely, predictable, and satisfactory delivery of goods and services.  Narrowing the scope of the EO to those contractors that have already been suspended or debarred would limit contracting officers' ability to identify contractors with track records of non-compliance.  It also would limit enforcement agencies' ability to assist contractors with significant labor violations to improve their labor law compliance, including through the use of labor compliance agreements, before suspension and debarment becomes the only option.    Applicability of Certain Executive Orders to DOD:  The Administration strongly objects to section 862, which would weaken a number of EOs and other actions taken by the President to protect taxpayer money and the integrity of the acquisition process and to improve the economy and efficiency of Federal contracting.  For example, the President's Memorandum on Contractor Tax Delinquency laid the foundation for limiting agencies' ability to make new awards to contractors with serious tax delinquencies.  These protections are no less relevant in the case of Federal contractors furnishing commercially-available off-the-shelf items.  Section 862 also undermines other EOs such as EO 13665 that protect against discrimination in Federal contractors' workplaces.  Discriminatory hiring and compensation practices decrease the likelihood that the most qualified and productive workers are hired at the market efficient price, and hence broad applicability is required to ensure an efficient market in Federal contracting.  The remainder of EOs that section 862 seeks to weaken -- including those encouraging the use of Project Labor Agreements requiring that employees be notified of their statutory labor rights, as well as raising the minimum wage and providing paid sick leave for Federal contract employees -- similarly improve productivity of Federal contractors' workplaces.  As such, section 862 should be struck as it would decrease the economy and efficiency of the Federal procurement system.  Personnel Background and Security Investigations:  The Administration strongly objects to section 973, which would transfer responsibility for personnel background and security investigations of DOD personnel from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to the Defense Security Service.  This provision would undermine the ability of the Federal Government to achieve economies of scale by further fragmenting the investigation process while diminishing the security, effectiveness, and efficiency of operations.  The Administration is currently standing up the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB), which will strengthen how the Government performs background investigations.  NBIB will be housed at OPM to conduct the vast majority of background investigations, but will leverage DOD expertise to bring the fullest national security and IT resources to bear against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.  Section 973 would upend this plan and interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine appropriate means for implementing this critical national security function.  It would also delay ongoing security clearance reform efforts, and likely cause significant investigative delays. 14   Expansion of DOD Hiring Flexibilities:  The Administration supports the inclusion of section 1106 (Direct Hire for post-secondary students and recent graduates), and section 1103 (temporary and term appointments), which would increase the ability of DOD to recruit and hire the talent it needs to carry out critical mission areas.  We urge the Congress to broaden these provisions to include other Federal agencies under Title 5 of the United States Code.  Hiring and recruitment flexibilities provided in these provisions would be extremely valuable for all Federal agencies, and would enable Government-wide improvements to help meet Federal workforce needs.  Program Acquisition and Contracting Restrictions:  The Administration  objects to section 145, which would prohibit the Department from using authorized funds to re-host the COMPASS CALL Primary Mission Equipment from the EC-130H to a commercial business jet without conducting a full and open competition.  The Air Force requires the flexibility to employ appropriate contracting authorities as allowed by law, including the exemptions to full and open competition in order to efficiently and effectively execute the COMPASS CALL re-host plan.  If the Air Force determines that less than full and open competition is allowable and advisable, conducting a full and open competition will unnecessarily delay fielding critical warfighter capability.  The Administration also objects to section 146, which would restrict the Department from obligating or expending funds on the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System recapitalization program, unless the Air Force uses a fixed-price contract for engineering and manufacturing development.  The restriction places unacceptable risk on the program by restricting the Department's ability to use a contract type which is best suited for the development effort.  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1086 and 1087, which would disband the F-35 Joint Program Office following the F-35 full-rate production decision (expected in April 2019), and establish the F-35 Follow-on Modernization program as a separate major defense acquisition program.  The contention that the F-35A, F-35B, and F-35C are essentially three distinct aircraft with significantly different missions and capability requirements misses the mark and does not take into account the essential role that the F-35 Joint Program Office plays in the program, or the international nature of the program and the role that the international partners will continue to play for the remainder of this, the most complex cooperative weapons program DOD has ever undertaken.  The follow-on modernization effort, which is just beginning, and the challenging transition from development to global sustainment and life-cycle support require continued management of the enterprise from a central Joint Program Office.  While a transition to individual, Service-led, F-35 variant program offices might conceivably be advantageous at some time, now is not that time, and retaining the current program structure for the Follow-on Modernization program, with its existing oversight mechanisms, is the most prudent approach.    Missile Defense Programs:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1663, which would require the initiation of concept definition, design, research, development, and engineering evaluation and test for a space-based intercept and defeat layer and space test bed.  There currently is no requirement for a space-based intercept and there are concerns about the technical feasibility and long-term affordability of interceptors in space.  The Department is conducting an evaluation on a space-based missile defense layer, as required by section 1685 of the FY 2016 NDAA.  The results of that evaluation will inform the technical feasibility of such a capability.   15  Defense Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Board:  The Administration objects to the provision in section 811, which would create a new Defense-specific CAS Board to create standards addressing the measurement, assignment, and allocation of contractor costs.  This action would result in unnecessary overlap and duplication with the functions of the existing Government-wide CAS Board and could result in contractors with both Defense and civilian contracts having to comply with two different standards for the same cost issue.  Requiring the use of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) would impose inappropriate constraints on the Board's ability to carry out its responsibilities.  GAAP focuses on reporting the financial results of overall operations, and addresses neither the allocation of costs to individual contracts nor the allowability of contract costs.  Section 811 also imposes inappropriate limitations on the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) despite its historical success in savings on average of $3 billion annually due to findings, primarily those related to non-compliances with CAS and the Federal Acquisition Regulation Cost Principles.  Commercial audit firms would audit GAAP costs, while DCAA would be limited to audits of direct costs on cost contracts and to audits of indirect costs only at contractors where their Government cost-type contracts are more than 50 percent of the entities' total sales.  This would exclude some of DOD's largest contract from DCAA oversight.  Audits by both DCAA and commercial audit firms would create burdens and inefficiencies for both contractors and Government agencies.  Modified Restrictions on Undefinitized Contractual Actions (UCAs):  The Administration objects to section 816, which would require that UCAs be awarded on a fixed-price level of effort basis.  Fixed-price level of effort is a contract type that is most appropriately used to acquire labor, as in the case of research or investigatory requirements.  The Department employs UCAs largely in part to enable the contractor to acquire materials (e.g. long lead) for major weapon system programs, something this provision would seem to prohibit. UCAs are also used when the urgency of a Government need argues strongly against the negotiations delay caused by establishing final terms.   Requirement to Use Firm Fixed-Price Contracts for Foreign Military Sales (FMS):  The Administration objects to section 828, which restricts the contract type for FMS.  Frequently, DOD combines requirements with FMS requirements on a single contract, or has contractors concurrently producing weapon systems for its requirements and FMS requirements under separate contracts.  If the Department were precluded from using the appropriate type contract in any particular environment, it would effectively constrain DOD's ability to deliver best value to the FMS customer, and eliminate opportunities to achieve efficiencies by combining U.S. and FMS requirements on the same contract.    Preference for Performance-Based Contractual Payments:  The Administration objects to the provision of section 829 that would preclude DOD from conditioning performance-based payments on costs incurred.  Performance-based payments are a method of contract financing and should not be used to pay contractors amounts in excess of costs incurred in advance of the Government's receipt of the item or service.    Products and Services Purchased through Contracting Program for Firms that Hired the Severely Disabled:  The Administration strongly objects to section 829G, which would jeopardize approximately 33,000 existing jobs that DOD provides to people with severe disabilities, to include 2,800 veterans.  Furthermore, this provision would effectively preclude the Department from awarding near-term contracts to enable opportunities for future employment for countless others with severe disabilities.  The Department is by far the largest single procurer of goods and 16  services from Ability One within the Federal Government.  The provision would require DOD to perform several statutory duties that are currently performed by the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, the Federal agency that administers the Ability One Program.  For example, section 829G would require DOD contracting officers to determine when a firm's (nonprofit agency) employee is significantly disabled and ensure their hours equate to the 75 percent Direct Labor Hour (DLH) ratio in this section.  Current law requires the 75 percent DLH ratio to be calculated based on all DLH in the firm's entire facility during the fiscal year.  Additionally, there would be no mechanism available to legally add products or services to the Procurement List, restricting contracting with non-profits that employ people with severe disabilities to those items that are currently on the List.  There is no practical way for the Department's contracting officers to meet the pre-contract formation and post-contract administration requirements of section 829G and would therefore bring these contracts and renewals to a standstill along with the employment opportunities that these contracts provide.    Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS):  The Administration objects to language in section 901, which would move DFAS from the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to the Under Secretary of Defense (Business Management and Support) organization.  DFAS performs important financial management and pay functions that are and should remain under the purview of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).  This action would remove core financial management functions, including payment of the Department's vendors, cash management, and financial audit support from the supervision of the CFO and sever critical links between DFAS and the CFO with respect to management of the Department's funding and audit functions.  A crucial ingredient to all the Services achieving unqualified financial audit opinions is the role DFAS plays as a service provider.  As the DOD focal point for audit, the CFO's centralized control of the service provider and the audit plan ensures all are vectored properly.  Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund (JIEDDF):  The Administration objects to section 1531, which fails to address the successor fund to the JIEDDF mandated by the FY 2016 NDAA.  Without the authorization of the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund, the successor fund proposed by DOD, the Administration is constrained in its ability to enable rapid response to non-traditional, unanticipated improvised threats on the battlefield, degrade improvised explosive device precursor facilitation networks of ISIL and other violent non-state actors globally, and protect against the rapidly emerging improvised threats currently faced by U.S. forces.  Preference for Commercial Services:  The Administration objects to the provision of section 864 that would preclude agencies from acquiring certain services unless they are commercial services, except where the agency makes a written determination establishing that no commercial services are suitable to meet the agency's needs.  The range of applicable services has been significantly expanded beyond the information technology services specified in section 855 of the FY 2016 NDAA to include broad service categories such as logistics management services.  Because cost-type contracts cannot be used for the acquisition of commercial items, this expansion would unnecessarily and inappropriately limit the Department's ability to execute contracts using the most appropriate contract type.  For example, even though planned logistics support services for the Joint Strike Fighter are optimally suited for a cost-type contract, the Department would be precluded from using a cost-type contract as long as the services were available commercially.   17  Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Reform:  The Administration appreciates that the bill adopts a number of the UCMJ reforms proposed by the Administration, including enhanced victims' rights (including anti-retaliatory measures), improvements to trial procedures, and updated sentencing guidelines.  National Defense Strategy:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1096, which would require DOD to publish a new national defense strategy annually.  A national defense strategy must provide strategic direction, priorities, and tradeoffs to address both near and longer-term challenges.  If a document is truly strategic, its shelf-life will be far longer than one year.  A new strategy takes time to integrate within and usefully impact the Department's many operational, budgetary, scenario, and other assessments, processes, and systems.  DOD continually assesses and regularly adjusts its strategy; however, formal annual assessments would create substantial administrative burden and discordant direction that degrades the effectiveness and efficiency.  Authority to Provide Reimbursable Auditing Services to Certain Non-Defense Agencies:  The Administration appreciates the modification to section 893 of the FY 2016 NDAA in section 892 of the bill.  However, the Administration recommends that section 892 repeal section 893(a) of the FY 2016 NDAA, rather than amending section 893(a).  The prohibition on DCAA performing audits for non-defense agencies is counterproductive to the intent to reduce DCAA's incurred cost inventory backlog.  It would extend the length of time required to reduce the audit backlog and create burdens and inefficiencies in the audit process for both contractors and multiple Government agencies.   Transfer of the DCAA:  The Administration strongly objects to the language in section 901 that would place DCAA under the Under Secretary of Defense (Management and Support).  GAO previously concluded that audit independence would be impaired if DCAA was aligned with either the USD/AT&L or the Office of the Inspector General.  Alignment under the Under Secretary of Defense (Management and Support) would impair DCAA's ability to perform independent audits.  This would reduce DCAA's independence because it would locate DCAA within the organization responsible for acquisition and contract administration.  Asia-Pacific Rebalance Infrastructure:  The Administration strongly objects to the exclusion of requested language which would authorize DOD to proceed with planning, design and construction for public infrastructure projects identified as necessary mitigation for several significant impacts identified in the Navy's 2015 \"Guam and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Military Relocation (2012 Roadmap Adjustments) Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement\" and Record of Decision.  The cultural repository and public health laboratory are critical projects required to address the impact of the expanding military installations and missions on Guam necessary to implement the Asia-Pacific rebalance.  A key aspect of the Asia-Pacific rebalance is to create a more operationally resilient Marine Corps presence in the Pacific and invest in Guam as a joint strategic hub.  This necessary authority supports the ability of the President to execute our foreign and defense policies in coordination with our ally, Japan.  Additionally, it calls into question among regional states our commitment to implement the realignment plan and our ability to execute our defense strategy.  Transfer of Drug Interdiction and Counterdrug Funding:  The Administration strongly objects to the section 4501 Other Authorizations transfer of $258.3 million from Drug Interdiction and Counter Drug Activities account to the unrequested Security Cooperation Enhancement Fund.  The transfer of these funds would severely hinder DOD's drug interdiction and counter-drug 18  efforts at a time when drug trafficking to the United States is increasing.  Estimates of opium poppy cultivation in Mexico nearly tripled from 2013-2015 and over 90 percent of the heroin produced in Mexico is trafficked to the United States.  The rate of overdose deaths involving heroin have tripled in the past three years.  Colombia's estimated potential cocaine production increased by 67 percent since 2014 and is now at an eight year high.  It is critically important that DOD continue to provide targeted and focused counterdrug training, equipment, and other assistance to meet the President's objectives under the National Drug Control Strategy goals, while supporting national strategies that aim to enhance security in Colombia, Mexico, and Central America, and protect U.S. public health and safety.  The new Fund also raises other concerns.     Increase of Micro-purchase Threshold, Simplification of Proposal Development and Evaluation, and Acquisition of Innovative Commercial Items:  The Administration strongly supports the Committee's efforts to reduce the complexity of the acquisition process and believes that sections 812 and 815 should be broadened to ensure the entire Federal Government has the necessary tools to acquire best value solutions and bring even greater savings to the taxpayer.  Section 812 would reduce unnecessary complexity of small dollar acquisitions by raising the micro-purchase threshold.  Civilian agencies should be able to receive these benefits and the Administration supports increasing these benefits by including civilian agencies and raising the threshold even greater to $10,000.  Section 815 would simplify proposal requirements for certain services under Multiple Award task order contracts.  The Administration estimates that multi-agency contracts or Government-wide acquisition vehicles account for approximately half of all service contract dollars awarded each year.  To receive the greatest benefit of this section and create parity among acquisition vehicles, the Administration supports expanding this provision to all multi-agency contracts or Government-wide acquisition vehicles including the Federal Supply Schedules.  The Administration also appreciates inclusion of section 868 which would provide pilot authority for the Department to acquire, on a pilot basis, innovative commercial items in the same manner as it acquires research and development, but urges the Congress to broaden the pilot to include the Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration so that they too may take advantage of the pilot to obtain emerging technologies more efficiently.  Repeal of Moratorium on Public-Private Competition:  The Administration objects to section 806, which would eliminate the moratorium on public-private competition between Government employees and private sector contractors to perform commercial activities that support DOD missions.  OMB continues to work with DOD and other agencies on efforts to ensure the most effective mix of Federal employees and contractors and believes more time is needed for efforts to ensure core in-house capabilities for critical functions before the moratorium is lifted.    Board for the Correction of Military Records and Discharge Review Board Matters:  The Administration objects to the overly-burdensome and duplicative reporting requirements in section 536.  The Department has exercised extraordinary commitment to service members and veterans through extensive reforms to the military department's Review Boards' policies and procedures.  These reforms include, but are not limited to, the inclusion of mental health professionals in all aspects of Discharge Review Board and Board for Correction of Military and Naval Records procedures, as well as highly-specialized procedures relative to cases in which petitioners alleged Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and/or Traumatic Brain Injury as factors in determinations regarding their service records.  These procedures have been highly effective in addressing petitions asserting such bases and the Boards have performed and continue to perform their missions in open and transparent fashion, including the publication of redacted decisions in 19  public reading rooms.  The proposed reporting requirements, however, would not only require substantial, additional assets and take significant time, compromising the Boards' ability to accomplish their missions and provide equitable relief to deserving service members and veterans, but will also expose significant sensitive information and potentially Personally Identifying Information.  The proposal would also mandate the revelation of factors both considered and not considered in each case.  Such a requirement impinges on the Boards' ability to fashion appropriate remedies in highly individualized cases and also requires the creation and/or revelation of a template seemingly applicable in every case.  Such an approach not only threatens the required autonomy of the Boards, but also creates a \"checklist\" approach belying the importance of discretion and consideration of each and every case on its merits while also creating the harmful practice of precedence in Board cases.  Notification on the Provision of Defense Sensitive Support:  The Administration objects to section 1052, which would levy an unnecessary and burdensome reporting and notification requirement on the Department regarding sensitive support to agencies outside DOD.  The existing clandestine quarterly reports keeps the Congress fully informed of the Defense Sensitive Support Activity (DSSA) process and each approved request for support.  Introducing an additional requirement for prior notification of each instance of requested support is fundamentally impractical given their frequency, risks slowing or interrupting providing critical and timely support for operations, and burdens limited staff with duplicative reporting requirements in a time of declining resources, staff the Department relies upon to do the effective oversight and execution of the DSSA process that the Congress and supported organizations expect.  Associate Director for Military Affairs:  The Administration objects to section 1049, which would specify criteria and responsibilities of an Associate Director for Military Affairs at the CIA, because it is unnecessary and duplicative.  Existing policies, regulations, and interagency agreements already provide for an Associate Director for Military Affairs.  Transfer of Military-Grade Firearms to Private Companies:  The Administration objects to section 1056, which could put the U.S. Army in the position of transferring certain military-grade firearms to dealers in the United States -- the kinds of transfers that are highly regulated under existing law -- and potentially make it more difficult for those weapons to be traced if later used in crimes.    Special Immigrant Visas:  The Administration is deeply concerned that this legislation does not extend or authorize new visas as requested for the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program, which enables Afghans who have worked alongside our troops and our diplomats to seek refuge in the United States.  Thousands of Afghans have performed this work, often at great personal risk.  Many have even lost their lives.  Many continue to face grave threats.  These Afghan civilians have been essential to accomplishing our mission in Afghanistan.    Use of Surplus Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Motors for Commercial Space Launches:  Section 1607 would direct the Comptroller General to conduct an analysis of the costs and benefits of providing surplus ICBMs to the private sector for commercial space launch purposes.  Both Federal law and the Administration's National Space Transportation Policy currently prohibit such transfers for commercial use.  The Administration continues to support this long-standing policy, which seeks to avoid undermining investment, entrepreneurship, and innovation in the launch market.  20  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.  * * * * * * *   21  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they are tailored to advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that they minimize uncertainty.  H.R. 712 would undermine critical public health and safety protections, introduce needless complexity and uncertainty in agency decision-making, and interfere with agency performance of statutory mandates.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 712.   H.R. 712 would impose unnecessary procedures on agencies and invite wasteful litigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, it must adhere to the robust and well-understood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.   This Administration is committed to a regulatory system that is informed by science, is cost-justified, and is consistent with economic growth.  Through the Regulatory Flexibility Act as well as through Executive Order and the direction of the President, agencies must also ensure that they take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.  Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased public participation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a regulatory retrospective review.  Through Executive Orders 13579 and 13610, the Administration also has taken important steps to promote systematic retrospective review of regulations by all agencies.  Collectively, these requirements promote flexible, commonsense, cost-effective regulation.   Passage of H.R. 712 would impose additional, unnecessary procedural requirements that would seriously undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory mandates.  H.R. 712 would require numerous, cumbersome layers of reporting from Federal agencies.  It also would address a nonexistent problem that is already prohibited by Federal regulations:  collusion between agencies, interest groups, and the courts to avoid compliance with the rulemaking procedures described above.  H.R. 712 accordingly would serve only to introduce redundant processes for litigation settlements and spawn excessive, expensive, and time-consuming regulatory litigation.  H.R. 712 therefore would impede the ability of agencies to protect public health, welfare, safety, and our environment, as well as to promote economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.    If the President were presented with H.R. 712, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration will not support continued failure to make the investments the Nation needs.

The Administration looks forward to working with both houses of Congress to pass such a bill before the end of 2015.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration would strongly oppose any effort to offset this increased Federal budget cost by reducing the Prevention and Public Health Fund.  The Affordable Care Act created this Fund to help prevent disease, detect it early, and manage conditions before they become severe.  There has been bipartisan and bicameral support for allocation of the Fund, and the Congress directed uses of the Fund through FY 2014 and FY 2015 appropriations legislation.  The Fund supports critical investments such as tobacco use reduction and programs to reduce health-care associated infections.  By concentrating on the causes of chronic disease, the Fund helps more Americans stay healthy.      The Administration is committed to strengthening Medicare for those who depend on it and protection of the public\u2019s health.  We believe that this legislation fails to accomplish these goals.

The Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort to provide full-year appropriations legislation consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which provided significant relief from sequestration for both defense and non-defense priorities.  The legislation would help to grow the economy and build middle-class economic security by investing in education, job training, advanced manufacturing, infrastructure, and research while keeping America safe.  Additionally, the legislation is largely free of new unrelated ideological riders.  In addition to making permanent vital improvements to tax credits for working- and middle-class families, this legislation also would bring certainty to small businesses, companies investing in U.S. innovation, and charities, while extending important incentives for hiring and investing in low-income communities.  The agreement would extend tax incentives for investments in wind and solar energy, driving significant reductions in carbon pollution and other dangerous air pollutants and providing certainty for investments in clean energy.  The agreement also would phase out bonus depreciation, which was intended to be a temporary incentive, saving over $200 billion over the next decade relative to its indefinite continuation.  The Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort to provide full-year appropriations legislation for FY 2016 largely free of new unrelated ideological riders, and take a critical step toward a simpler, fairer tax code and a stronger economy, and urges the Congress to pass this legislation.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4557, which could extend indefinitely deadlines for the brick and structural clay industry to limit mercury and other hazardous air pollution.  Specifically, H.R. 4557 would extend compliance deadlines for the Brick and Structural Clay National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants until all litigation on the final rule is complete, thereby creating an incentive for parties to litigate the rulemaking and the related corrections notice for as long as possible in order to delay air pollution reductions.  In the meantime, H.R. 4557 would undermine the public health protections of the Clean Air Act (CAA) by allowing further emissions of approximately 30 tons per month of toxic air pollution from brick and clay products production facilities.  These toxic emissions include mercury, gases, and other hazardous metals which are associated with a variety of acute and chronic health effects, including cancers.    The CAA required the Environmental Protection Agency to finalize pollution standards for toxic air pollution from all industrial sectors by 2000.  Since then, sources in many other sectors have been complying with standards that limit their emissions of cancer-causing toxic air pollutants.  The subject rule reflects CAA requirements while providing flexible compliance options and the maximum time allowed by law for compliance.  It also makes distinctions between requirements for small and large kilns in order to reduce the impacts on small businesses.   Since its enactment in 1970, and subsequent amendment in 1977 and 1990\u2014each time with strong bipartisan support\u2014the CAA has improved the Nation's air quality and protected public health.  Over that same period of time, the economy has grown over 200 percent while emissions of key pollutants have decreased nearly 70 percent.  Forty-five years of clean air regulation have shown that a strong economy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.

Obstructing implementation of the JCPOA would greatly undermine our national security interests.  It would result in the collapse of a comprehensive diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and in turn would allow for the resumption of a significantly less constrained Iranian nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to America\u2019s credibility as a leader of international diplomacy.  This would have ripple effects, jeopardizing both the hard work of sustaining a unified coalition to combat Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region and America\u2019s ability to lead the world on nuclear non-proliferation.   By prohibiting actions to provide relief from nuclear-related sanctions on Iran even if Iran meets all of its JCPOA commitments \u2013 significantly rolling back and constraining its nuclear program under an unprecedented verification and monitoring regime \u2013 H.R. 3457 effectively seeks to renegotiate the commitments reached by all of the P5+1, the EU, and Iran, and endorsed by the UN Security Council.  The Administration has consistently made clear that the purpose of the nuclear negotiations, and ultimately the JCPOA, was to address one issue only \u2013 the international community\u2019s concerns over Iran\u2019s nuclear program and the need to verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  This is the approach with which the United States was able to garner international support for our sanctions and achieve a diplomatic resolution.   The Administration supports efforts by U.S. terrorism victims to pursue compensation, consistent with our national security, and the JCPOA does nothing to impede those efforts.  The Administration continues to work to explore all possible avenues for compensation, but will not do so in a manner that would connect this issue to the JCPOA, thereby jeopardizing its implementation and Iran\u2019s fulfillment of the critical nuclear steps required under the JCPOA.   As we address our concerns with Iran\u2019s nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed and shares the deep concerns of the Congress and the American people about Iran\u2019s support for terrorism.  We will continue to vigorously enforce our sanctions against these activities, none of which have been relieved under the JCPOA, and work closely with our partners in the region to counter them using a range of unilateral and multilateral tools.

Specifically, the Amendment includes a provision that would defund Planned Parenthood.  By eliminating Federal funding for a major provider of health care, the Senate Amendment to H.J.Res. 61 would limit access to health care for women, men, and families across the Nation, and disproportionately impact low-income individuals.  The Administration urges the Congress to pass full-year appropriations legislation for FY 2016 that excludes ideological provisions that are intended to advance a narrow political agenda, reverses sequestration for defense and non-defense priorities, and makes critical investments needed to support national security and sustain economic growth.   If the President were presented with H.J.Res. 61, as amended by this Amendment, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of H.R. 2028, making appropriations for energy and water development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  Although the bill supports key national security items, the bill drastically underfunds critical investments that develop American energy sources to build a clean and secure energy future; develop and commercialize the emerging technologies that create high-quality jobs and enhance the Nation's economic competitiveness; and improve resilience against current and ongoing climate impacts that threaten our economy, public health, and natural resources.  As a result, it would put at risk U.S. competitiveness in new markets for clean energy industries such as advanced vehicles, advanced manufacturing, energy efficiency for homes and businesses, and domestic renewable energy such as wind, solar, and biomass.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2028, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  Enacting H.R. 2028 and adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending limits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-class priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to threaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be motivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense for FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, millions fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and drastic cuts to scientific research awards and grants, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.     Sequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only through pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland Security, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of our economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear that he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense without also fixing non-defense.  The President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2028 and any other legislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the investments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense priorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both parties have urged.    The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Energy (DOE)  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Administration strongly objects to the $1.9 billion provided in the bill for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  Overall, this level is $790 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  Relative to the FY 2016 Budget request, the bill reduces funding for renewable energy by 34 percent, sustainable transportation by 23 percent, and energy efficiency by 35 percent.  These reductions would significantly underfund critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies including wind energy and advanced manufacturing capabilities.  At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement, curtailing solutions to reduce U.S. dependence on oil and reduce energy waste, and undermining the Nation's industrial competitiveness in the future global clean energy economy.  The Congress is urged to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request of $2.7 billion.  Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration objects to the  $291 million provided in the bill for ARPA-E, which is $34 million or 10 percent below the FY 2016 Budget request.  This funding reduction would impact investments in transformational technologies that reduce energy-related emissions, increase energy efficiency across multiple economic sectors, and reduce energy imports.  Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.  The Administration objects to the $151 million provided in the bill for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, which is $119 million or  44 percent below the FY 2016 Budget request.  At the funding levels provided in the bill, critical activities supporting a secure, reliable, and modernized electricity grid as well as energy assurance, would go unfunded.  Investments in a modernized grid are necessary to move the Nation to a cleaner more secure energy future.  Fossil Energy and Nuclear Energy.  The Administration notes that the bill includes funding above the FY 2016 Budget request in some areas that are already well established in the market, including for nuclear ($948 million, $41 million or 4.5 percent above the FY 2016 Budget request) and for Fossil Energy Research and Development ($598 million, $38 million or  6.8 percent above the FY 2016 Budget request), yet makes drastic reductions in those areas that are most crucial to the Nation's clean energy future and continued U.S. technology leadership.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fund DOE's energy programs at the requested level, as this balances the portfolio among items of short-, medium-, and long-term progress and accounts for the potential contributions to U.S. leadership in these technology areas.  Office of Science.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Office of Science, in particular the support for capable exascale computing.  However, the level of funding provided, which is $0.2 billion below the FY 2016 Budget request of $5.3 billion, would reduce research and development programs throughout the agency and the Administration encourages the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request.  2  Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).  The Administration opposes the $200 million level provided for the SPR, which is $57 million or 22 percent below the FY 2016 Budget request of $257 million.  At this funding level, the bill fails to fund activities supporting timely replacement of equipment and physical systems that are necessary to begin to address the backlog of deferred maintenance activities, and to enhance distribution flexibility and reliability.  Absent this funding, the SPR's energy security mission might be at risk.  Energy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request of $131 million for EIA to address critical energy data gaps, expand domestic energy data and analysis, and increase energy data integration with Canada and Mexico.  Nuclear Waste.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for implementing a workable solution for the management and disposal of the Nation's nuclear waste.  Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act.  The Administration strongly objects to section 312 of the bill, which excludes information technology (IT) spending at DOE labs from the management improvements and accountability introduced by the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act.  This exclusion would constrain the ability of the Secretary and Chief Information Officer to ensure the Department's mission is effectively and efficiently executed by reducing duplicative IT systems, implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity solution, and addressing other IT management issues, which support the President's goal to deliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and accountable.  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request for DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to implement the DATA Act.  This funding would support efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending for data activities, updating IT systems, changing business processes, and employing a uniform procurement instrument identifier.  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund the FY 2016 Budget request for DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding would support efforts to manage digital services that have the greatest impact to citizens and businesses.  Corps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works (Corps)  Overall Funding.  The bill funds the Corps civil works program at a net level of $5.4 billion.  The Administration believes the more appropriate overall funding levels proposed in the FY 2016 Budget request would limit spending on projects that provide a low return to the Nation.  Office of the Assistant Secretary.  The bill funds the Office of the Assistant Secretary at  $3 million, a roughly $2 million, or 35 percent, decrease from the FY 2016 Budget request.  This reduction would not support the staffing necessary to provide oversight of the civil works program.  Corps Regulatory Program.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fund the Corps' regulatory program at the requested level.  A $5 million reduction in funding would inhibit the 3  Corps' ability to issue permits in a timely manner, which could negatively affect business and development, and to protect important aquatic resources, while undertaking needed programmatic improvements, including implementation of the Clean Water rulemaking.  Fill Material under the Clean Water Act.  The Administration believes it is essential to retain Federal Agency discretion to pursue rulemakings they deem necessary to protect America's clean water resources, which are critical to American families and businesses.  The Administration strongly opposes section 104 of the bill, which could hamstring future regulatory work.  Federal Flood Risk Management Standard.  The Administration objects to section 503 of the bill, which prohibits funds from being used to implement, administer, carry out, modify, revise, or enforce Executive Order 13690 entitled \"Establishing a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and Considering Stakeholder Input.\"  If enacted, this provision would undermine Federal agencies' ability to protect Federal investments and could make our communities more vulnerable to flood risks.   Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, and Central Utah Project  Overall Funding.  The bill provides $1.1 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and $10 million for the Central Utah Project.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support of the Bureau and the Central Utah Project.  Indian Water Rights Settlements.  The Administration objects to the $23 million or 23 percent reduction to the FY 2016 Budget request for the Bureau of Reclamation for implementing enacted Indian Water Rights Settlements, including reductions in funding for the Crow settlement of over 80 percent, the Aamodt settlement by more than half, and the Navajo-Gallup settlement by over 10 percent.  The funding requested for these settlements carefully considered funding levels necessary in FY 2016 and future years to meet the dates mandated in the settlement acts.  This reduction would make it difficult to meet Congress' own statutorily-defined deadlines.  Indian water settlement agreements can provide water supply certainty for tribal communities, boost economic growth, and end expensive and protracted litigation.  The Administration urges the Congress to restore funding for this important program to the levels in the FY 2016 Budget request.  San Joaquin River Restoration.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support of this important program to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts.  This restoration program is a multi-year effort that is integral to the implementation of Federal legislation that settled 18 years of litigation.  California Storage Projects.  The Administration strongly supports efforts to help alleviate the effects of drought in the West; however, the Administration is concerned with section 207, which establishes deadlines for completing feasibility studies for certain water storage projects.  The provision is unnecessary and the dates provided in the bill could prevent the participation of non-Federal partners in certain of the studies and may inhibit the Administration's ability to consider a full range of options for addressing these issues.  Dam Safety Authorization.  Section 205 of the bill amends the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act to allow new or supplementary non-safety-related project construction in conjunction with Safety of Dams work, provided that the additional costs are allocated to the authorized project purposes.  4  Any such authorization should ensure that the beneficiaries of the non-safety-related project construction pay their full share of the costs as a condition of construction and that there be no repayment contract for that portion of the project.  Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions in the bill, including sections 101 and 201, raise separation of powers concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *   5  ", "The Administration welcomes the bill's investments in improving resilience against current and ongoing climate impacts that threaten our economy, public health, and natural resources, as well as the Committee's stated support for the premise and goals of Mission Innovation.  Additionally, the Administration appreciates the Committee's work to support investments in critical nonproliferation efforts and in maintaining a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal.  However, the bill underfunds critical energy research and development activities and fails to put us on an achievable path toward doubling clean energy research and development by FY 2021.  Specifically, the Administration objects to the low funding levels provided for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  Reductions in both of these programs significantly below the FY 2017 Budget request would undermine critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies.  At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement.  Funding at this level also would impede development of solutions to reduce U.S. dependence on oil and reduce energy waste, and undermine the Nation's competitiveness in the future global clean energy economy.  The Administration supports the bill's investments in restoring the Nation's aquatic ecosystems, improving commercial navigation, and helping local communities reduce the risk of floods.  However, the Administration believes funding included in the bill for the Army Corps of Engineers beyond the FY 2017 Budget request would not provide a high return on investment to the American taxpayer.  In October 2015, the President worked with congressional leaders from both parties to secure the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA), which partially reversed harmful sequestration cuts slated for FY 2017.  By providing fully-paid-for equal dollar increases for defense and non-defense spending, the BBA allows for investments in FY 2017 that create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that are consistent with that agreement, and fully support economic growth, opportunity, and our national security priorities.  However, the Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the final bill that is presented to  the President includes such provisions, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Energy (DOE)  Mission Innovation.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's stated support for the premise and goals of Mission Innovation and the support expressed for the related regional consortia.  However, the bill underfunds critical energy research and development activities and fails to put us on an achievable path toward doubling clean energy research and development by FY 2021.  The bill underfunds investment in our students, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs; our businesses and universities; and our future economy.  This would slow the pace of progress on breakthroughs in energy efficiency and clean energy; undermine America's long-standing, nonpartisan support for pioneering research that seeks solutions to pressing problems; and hinder our ability to harness the power of new ideas and innovation to drive sustained economic growth in the clean energy economy of the future.  Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration objects to the $293 million provided in the bill for ARPA-E, a reduction of $57 million or 16 percent from the discretionary request for ARPA-E in FY 2017 Budget request.  This reduction would hinder the ability to invest in transformational technologies that reduce energy-related emissions, increase energy efficiency across multiple economic sectors, and reduce energy imports.  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  The Administration strongly objects to the $2.1 billion provided in the bill for the EERE.  Overall, this level is $825 million below the FY 2017 Budget request.  Relative to the FY 2017 Budget request, the bill reduces funding for renewable energy by 26 percent, sustainable transportation by 27 percent, and energy efficiency by 20 percent.  These reductions would significantly underfund critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies including wind energy, electric and other advanced vehicles, and building technologies.  At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement.  Funding at this level also would curtail solutions to reduce U.S. dependence on oil and reduce energy waste, and undermine the Nation's competitiveness in the future global clean energy economy.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request of $2.9 billion.  Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.  The Administration objects to the $206 million provided in the bill for Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability.  The FY 2017 Budget requested funding levels for research and development (R&D) that provide for a balanced R&D portfolio.  This includes funding for important energy storage and transformer resilience and advanced components activities as well as materials activities via the proposed Grid Manufacturing Institute.  Both the State Distribution-Level Reform and State Energy Assurance programs respond to important Quadrennial Energy Review recommendations and the Administration encourages the Congress to fund these programs.  2  Office of Science.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Office of Science, the level of funding provided, which is $172 million below the discretionary total of the FY 2017 Budget request, would significantly impact basic R&D programs.  Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).  The Administration opposes the $200 million level provided for SPR.  At the bill level, important investments in SPR maintenance activities would be deferred potentially adversely impacting operational readiness.  Energy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request of $131 million for EIA to fully fund investments in adding regional detail to petroleum data, enhancing commercial building energy efficiency data and expanding international analysis.  Nuclear Waste.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for implementing a workable solution for the management and disposal of the Nation's nuclear waste.  Departmental Administration.  The Administration appreciates language in the bill which provides flexibility to the Department in the management and funding of its support functions within this account.  However, a 10-percent reduction from the FY 2017 Budget request may significantly hinder DOE's ability to effectively implement priority management objectives such as project management and cost estimating, which ultimately drive greater efficiency within the agency.  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's strong support for NNSA's Weapons Activities, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors programs.  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  While the Administration appreciates the funding provided in the bill for DOE to implement the DATA Act, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to implement the DATA Act.  This funding would support efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and employing a uniform procurement instrument identifier.  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2017 Budget request for DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding would support efforts to manage digital services that have the greatest impact to citizens and businesses.  Corps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works (Corps)  Overall Funding.  The bill funds the Corps civil works program at a net level of $6 billion.  The Administration believes the more appropriate overall funding levels proposed in the FY 2017 Budget request which would limit spending on projects that provide a low return to the Nation.  Ecosystem Restoration.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for ecosystem restoration activities, such as Louisiana Coastal Area Ecosystem Restoration, Columbia River, 3  South Florida Ecosystem Restoration, and Missouri River Fish and Wildlife Recovery, at the levels provided in the FY 2017 Budget request.  Technical Assistance.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee's support for funding ongoing efforts that provide local communities with technical and planning assistance to enable them to reduce their flood risk, including nonstructural approaches.  Fill Material under the Clean Water Act.  The Administration believes that it is essential to retain Federal agencies' discretion to pursue rulemakings they deem necessary to protect America's clean water resources, which are critical to American families and businesses.  The Administration objects to section 103 of the bill, which could hamstring future regulatory work in this area, putting our water resources at risk.  Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project  Overall Funding.  The bill provides $1.2 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and $10 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Act.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for priorities within the Bureau of Reclamation's program, as reflected in the FY 2017 Budget request, including the San Joaquin River Restoration Program, Indian Water Rights settlements, and the WaterSMART program.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  4  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1937, which would undermine existing environmental safeguards for, at a minimum, almost all types of hardrock mines on Federal lands.  Specifically, H.R. 1937 would undermine sound Federal decision-making by eliminating appropriate reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act if certain conditions are met, circumventing public involvement in mining proposals, and bypassing the formulation of alternatives to proposals, among other things.  The Administration also opposes the legislation's severe restrictions on judicial review.  Although the legislation purports to limit litigation, its extremely short statute of limitations and vague constraints on the scope of prospective relief that a court may issue are likely to have the opposite effect.  The Administration strongly supports the development of rare earth elements and other critical minerals, but rejects the notion that their development is incompatible with existing safeguards regarding uses of public lands, environmental protection, and public involvement in agency decision-making.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3, which would immediately authorize the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline and related cross-border facilities and declare that the Secretary of State\u2019s January 2014 Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement satisfies the National Environmental Policy Act and any other provisions of law requiring Federal consultation or review with respect to the Keystone XL pipeline or its related facilities.   H.R. 3 seeks to circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether cross-border pipelines serve the national interest by authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline project prior to the completion of the Presidential Permitting process.  In doing so, it would cut short consideration of important issues relevant to the national interest.  The bill also would authorize the project despite uncertainty due to ongoing litigation in Nebraska.  Because H.R. 3 conflicts with longstanding Executive branch procedures regarding the authority of the President and prevents the thorough consideration of complex issues that could bear on U.S. national interests (including serious security, safety, environmental, and other ramifications), if presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports provisions in the bill to de-authorize projects that no longer meet the Nation's needs.  Creating and maintaining the Nation's water resources infrastructure is a shared responsibility between Federal and non-Federal beneficiaries and requires that the management, use, protection, and restoration of our water resources continue to evolve to meet the Nation's future needs.  The Administration welcomes the efforts in the bill to expand options for non-federal project partners who want to cover more of, or all of, the costs to study or construct a Corps project.  This legislation impedes Administration efforts to both enhance resilience and increase public-private collaboration and private investment in environmental restoration by establishing a confusing and duplicative mitigation bank program overseen by the RESTORE Council, which includes Governors from only the five states along the Gulf Coast.  The Administration urges the Congress to enact an important reform of the laws governing the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, which a proposal in the President's FY 2017 Budget would accomplish.  The proposal would raise $1.3 billion in additional revenue over 10 years from the commercial users of these waterways, which would help finance future capital investment and maintenance work on these waterways that will benefit these users and support economic growth.  The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress on bipartisan legislation to address the Nation's water resources challenges.  *******   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.J. Res. 64, a joint resolution of disapproval of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached between the P5+1 (United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, and Germany), the European Union, and Iran on July 14, 2015.  Enactment of the resolution would greatly undermine our national security interests on multiple fronts.  It would effectively block the international community from peacefully and verifiably preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, allow for the resumption of an unconstrained and unchecked Iranian nuclear program, and lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime that was sustained because the Administration sought to diplomatically resolve concerns regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear program.  Further, enactment of the resolution would deal a devastating blow to America\u2019s credibility as a leader of diplomacy and could ultimately result in the exhaustion of alternatives to military action.  If this resolution were enacted, the hard work of sustaining a unified coalition to combat Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the region would be much more difficult, as would America\u2019s ability to lead the world on nuclear non-proliferation.  Preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon has long been a top priority for the United States and for the Administration.  It has been the Administration\u2019s longstanding policy to retain all options to achieve that objective \u2013 including possible military options.  At the same time, the Administration has worked diligently with the Congress and our international partners to achieve a peaceful, diplomatic solution, recognizing that a negotiated understanding offers a more effective, verifiable, and durable resolution.  The JCPOA achieves this objective by reinforcing the prohibition against Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, verifiably cutting off all of Iran\u2019s potential pathways to a nuclear weapon, and instituting the most comprehensive inspection and verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program.  The JCPOA makes the United States and the world safer by removing the gravest threat that Iran could pose to the Middle East, including Israel and our Gulf partners.   The JCPOA, if faithfully implemented, will verifiably cut off Iran\u2019s ability to pursue a nuclear weapon through uranium enrichment, through a plutonium pathway, or through a potential covert path.  Iran is bound under the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons to never seek a nuclear weapon and the JCPOA provides the tools to ensure that Iran cannot use a peaceful program as cover to pursue a nuclear weapon.  The JCPOA is not based on trust, but on an unprecedented inspections, monitoring, and transparency regime.  Under the JCPOA, there will be 24/7 monitoring of Iran\u2019s key nuclear facilities.  Inspectors will be able to get timely access to the places they need to go for inspections, or Iran will be in violation of the JCPOA and risk the re-imposition of sanctions.  For decades, inspectors will have access to Iran\u2019s entire nuclear supply chain \u2013 from uranium mines and mills to centrifuge production facilities.  This means that in order for Iran to covertly acquire a nuclear weapon, it would need to build an entirely separate, undetected nuclear supply chain.  The JCPOA also facilitates the  International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s ability to complete its report on the possible military dimensions of Iran\u2019s pre-2003 program.  The JCPOA also ensures that Iran has powerful incentives to keep its nuclear commitments.  Before getting phased relief from secondary nuclear-related sanctions, Iran has to complete all of its major nuclear steps which will extend the amount of time it would take Iran to acquire enough fissile material for one weapon from the current two to three months to at least a year.  For example, the core of Iran\u2019s heavy-water reactor at Arak will be pulled out and filled with concrete, rendering it unable to produce plutonium that could be used for a weapon; two-thirds of its nearly 20,000 currently installed centrifuges will be removed; its current stockpile of enriched uranium will be reduced by 98 percent; and it must put in place the monitoring, surveillance, and access measures that will ensure the ability to verify that its nuclear program is used for exclusively peaceful purposes going forward.  If Iran fails to abide by its JCPOA commitments, all relieved sanctions, both unilateral and multilateral, can snap back into place.  The Administration is fully committed to continuing to brief and closely consult the Congress as we work with our international partners to ensure successful implementation of the JCPOA.  As we address our concerns with Iran\u2019s nuclear program through the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed and shares the deep concerns of the Congress and the American people about Iran\u2019s support for terrorism, its destabilizing role in the region, and its human rights abuses \u2013 this is why we will continue to vigorously enforce our sanctions against these activities and work closely with our partners in the region to counter them, using a range of unilateral and multilateral tools.  The JCPOA must be assessed by what it achieves on its central goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon \u2013 and the Administration urges the Congress to fully consider the stakes for our national security of walking away without the international community.  Without the JCPOA in place, Iran would likely resume the advancement of its nuclear program without any of the constraints or transparency required by this deal and without the international unity of our sanctions regime, which would be the worst of all possible worlds, leaving us in a position of weakness, not strength.  The President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA.  If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 64, he would veto the resolution.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration supports passage of Senate Amendment to H.R. 5325, making:   1) continuing appropriations for fiscal year (FY) 2017; 2) appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the FY ending September 30, 2017; 3) additional resources available to combat the Zika virus; and 4) for other purposes.    By providing a short-term funding bridge, the bill would allow critical Government functions to operate without interruption.  To minimize the negative impacts of a short-term funding measure on Federal agencies, the Congress should act quickly to enact full-year appropriations legislation for the remainder of FY 2017.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to support investments equally balanced between defense and non-defense spending that will create jobs, support middle-class families, contribute to long-term growth, and safeguard national security.   The Administration is disappointed the legislation continues a provision that would bar the Securities and Exchange Commission from taking action to increase transparency in public companies' political spending.  The Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of problematic provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  The Administration is also disappointed that\u2014despite overwhelming bipartisan, bicameral support\u2014the Congress failed to ensure that the Export-Import Bank is able to fully assist American businesses and workers by restoring a board quorum to the Bank.  The Administration appreciates that the Congress is finally taking bipartisan action to address the Zika virus.  The funding provided in the bill supports the Administration's efforts to reduce the risk of the Zika virus, particularly in pregnant women, by better controlling the mosquitoes that spread the Zika virus, develop new tools, including vaccines and better diagnostics to protect the Nation from the Zika virus, and to conduct crucial research projects needed to better understand the impacts of the Zika virus on infants and children.  The Administration appreciates that the bill is free of provisions that would inhibit the Administration's ability to target resources to best protect the American people from the Zika virus.  However, the Administration continues to believe that funding to fight the Zika virus should be treated as an emergency, the same as past public health emergencies, and is disappointed that the funding is partially offset.  The Administration is pleased that there appears to be a path forward to provide targeted funding to support people in communities impacted by natural disasters and catastrophic events,  including in Louisiana, Flint, Michigan, and other areas.  The Administration welcomes the bill's investments in communities ravaged by natural disasters, but notes that the funding provided is insufficient to fully address needed recovery efforts in these and other communities.  Upon its return in November, the Administration urges the Congress to take immediate action to provide funding, whether in an appropriations bill or another vehicle, that supports those who have been most impacted by natural disasters and other catastrophic events.   In addition, the Administration welcomes the bill's investments in military infrastructure, housing, and services for men and women in our Armed Forces and their families.  The Administration also appreciates the Congress' commitment to fund the benefits and services our veterans have earned.  * * * * * * *    2  ", "The Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s continued support of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in H.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, such as authorities that support ongoing operations.  The Administration also appreciates many of the acquisition reform measures included in the bill and looks forward to continued cooperation with the Committee on further progress in this area.   While there are areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration strongly objects to a number of provisions in the bill.  First, the President has been very clear about the core principle that he will not support a budget that locks in sequestration, and he will not fix defense without fixing non-defense spending.  Sequestration levels will damage our ability to restore readiness, advance badly-needed technological modernization, and keep faith with our troops and their families.  Unfortunately, the bill fails to authorize sufficient funding for our military\u2019s priorities, and instead uses Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in ways that leaders of both parties have made clear are inappropriate.  Shifting base budget resources into OCO risks undermining a mechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts and fails to provide a stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning is based.  The use of OCO funding to circumvent budget caps in defense spending also ignores the long-term connection between national security and economic security and fails to account for vital national security functions carried out at non-defense agencies.    Further, the bill fails to adopt many of the needed force structure and weapons system reforms included in the President\u2019s Budget, including failing to provide an authorization for a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round to allow the Department of Defense (DOD) to properly align the military\u2019s infrastructure with the needs of its evolving force.  It also includes non-germane provisions, such as those undermining the Endangered Species Act, that have nothing to do with national defense.  The President\u2019s defense strategy depends on investing every dollar where it will have the greatest effect, which the Administration\u2019s FY 2016 proposals will accomplish through critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, slow growth in compensation, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The Committee\u2019s changes would constrain the ability of DOD to align military capability and force structure with the President\u2019s defense strategy and to reduce unneeded costs.  The bill also continues unwarranted restrictions, and imposes onerous additional ones, regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay.  If this bill were presented to the President, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend to the President that he veto it.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below, and urges Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to make necessary changes to the bill.  In particular, this is the time to come together to find a comprehensive and real solution to sequestration that strengthens both our security and our economy.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the classified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns on classified programs.   Guantanamo Detainee Provisions:  The Administration strongly objects to several provisions of the bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  As the Administration has said many times before, operating this facility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  Rather than taking steps to bring this chapter of our history to a close, as the President has repeatedly called upon Congress to do, this bill aims to extend it.  Not only would it extend existing restrictions, it would impose additional unwise and unnecessary ones that would further impede efforts to responsibly close the facility.  Under existing law, the Secretary of Defense is already required to make a determination that actions have been or will be taken to substantially mitigate risks to the United States or U.S. persons or interests posed by detainee transfers abroad.  Sections 1038 and 1039 would impose still more onerous restrictions on such transfers, and, in some cases, seek to prohibit certain transfers entirely.  Sections 1036 and 1037 would prohibit the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States or to construct or modify any facility in the United States to house detainees.  The President has objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation.  The restrictions contained in this bill are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests, and when and where to transfer them consistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy.  Sections 1036, 1038, and 1039 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances, and section 1038 could in some circumstances interfere with a detainee\u2019s right to the writ of habeas corpus.  In addition, section 1034 would require burdensome and unnecessary reporting to Congress and could interfere with the President\u2019s authority to protect sensitive national security information.  Sections 1040 and 1041 would impermissibly require the disclosure of certain documents, including those protected by privilege, and restrict specified DOD funds until those documents are provided to Congress, despite the Administration\u2019s ongoing cooperation in providing documents and information to Congress.  Sequestration and Misuse of OCO Funds:  The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s authorization of sequester level appropriations for items that were requested in and belong in the base budget, and use of OCO - a funding mechanism intended to pay for wars and not subject to the budget caps - to pay for $38 billion in base requirements.  Sequestration adds risk to our national security by threatening the size, readiness, presence, and capability of our military, and threatens the economic security on which our national security depends.  The Committee clearly recognizes that the President\u2019s Budget level for defense is needed, but authorizes it in a way that fails to acknowledge the need to reverse sequestration for both defense and non-defense spending. 2  Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) Recommendations:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for some of the MCRMC recommendations to improve our military compensation and retirement systems, and encourages Congress to support the additional recommendations for which DOD has transmitted legislation.  The Administration is still evaluating how the more complex recommendations - such as the Blended Retirement System and Reserve Component Duty Statuses - would affect the All-Volunteer Force, and expects to provide the Committee with further views on these proposals in the coming months.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress and the MCRMC on these provisions to meet our solemn responsibility to ensure that any changes protect the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer Force, improve quality-of-life for service members and their families, and safeguard the fiscal sustainability of the military compensation and retirement systems. Compensation Reform:  The President\u2019s Budget provides the funding and common-sense reforms that will ensure that service members receive competitive pay and benefits and critical training and equipment.  The Administration believes it is imperative to slow the growth of basic pay and housing allowances, modernize military healthcare, and reform how commissaries operate, and strongly encourages members of Congress to support these reforms, which would save $1.7 billion in FY 2016 and $18 billion through FY 2020.   Among these reforms are proposed improvements that will modernize the TRICARE program.  TRICARE remains fundamentally unchanged since its inception in the mid-1990s and is antiquated by contemporary health plan standards.  The Consolidated Health Plan structure would provide DOD with substantial projected savings, simplify TRICARE for beneficiaries, and offer participants more freedom to choose providers.  Failing to enact the TRICARE and other various reform proposals would compel DOD to take additional reductions in the areas of readiness, modernization, and force structure.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress on these and other reforms to modernize and enhance the military health care system. Prohibition on Conducting Additional BRAC Round:  The Administration strongly objects to section 2702, which would preclude any funds being authorized for use toward an additional BRAC round.  This impairs the ability of the Executive Branch to plan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration strongly urges Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which would allow DOD to rightsize its infrastructure while providing important assistance to affected communities, freeing resources currently consumed by maintaining unneeded facilities.  In the absence of authorization of a new round of BRAC, the Administration will pursue alternative options to reduce this wasteful spending and ensure that DOD\u2019s limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security. Modification of Authority to Provide Assistance to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1223, which would significantly restrict the authority to provide the Government of Iraq with assistance to counter the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to implement the President\u2019s strategy to counter ISIL.  The provisions providing that three groups should be treated as \u201ca country\u201d for certain assistance purposes and mandating that assistance be provided directly to specific groups - even absent authorization from the Government of Iraq - are particularly damaging, have already created negative diplomatic consequences for the United 3  States, are inconsistent with the longstanding U.S. foreign policy of working to maintain a stable, unified Iraq, and could put the United States at risk of violating Iraq\u2019s sovereignty as well as the arms embargo on Iraq established by relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.  These provisions would fundamentally undermine the Government of Iraq and undercut our ongoing military operations in coordination with the Government of Iraq to degrade, destroy, and ultimately defeat ISIL.  Moreover, while the Government of Iraq has made progress toward political reconciliation, that process is ongoing, and requiring that the provision of the assistance specified in section 1223 be contingent on satisfaction of all conditions articulated in that section could undermine this progress.  Finally, with the consent and full support of the Government of Iraq, the United States already has provided - and plans to continue to provide - significant military assistance to the security forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government and Sunni tribal security forces.   Rocket Propulsion System Development Program:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1603, which would place restrictions on the funds to eliminate the Nation\u2019s use of non-allied space launch engines for national security space launches by 2019.  The Administration also strongly objects to moving Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) development funding into the more restrictive Rocket Propulsion System Development line item.  The Administration is committed to transitioning from non-allied engines; however, an engine-centric approach as laid out in this section would not preserve the Nation\u2019s assured access to space.  While rocket engines are a major component of a launch vehicle, they are only one of many critical components.  These components must be designed and developed together to meet the ultimate cost and performance goals, not only for the launch vehicle but also for the support, operations, and production infrastructure as well.  Without a comprehensive strategy that ensures the availability of operational launch systems, the government risks investing hundreds of millions of dollars without any guarantee of ensuring assured access to space.   Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund:  The Administration objects to the elimination of the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF) because it removes a flexible, partnership-focused approach to counterterrorism.  While the Administration is appreciative of support for the border security and capability enhancements for Jordan, military construction, and specific counter- ISIL programs, redirecting CTPF funding to these other activities precludes DOD from building on existing tools and authorities to respond to a range of terrorist threats.  The Administration strongly encourages Congress to authorize the $2.1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2016. Sense of Congress on the Government of Iran\u2019s Nuclear Program and Malign Military Activities:  Section 1232 contains language pertaining to the ongoing P5+1 nuclear negotiations with Iran that will likely undermine our negotiating team as they work with our international partners to achieve a long-term, comprehensive deal that prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  Open Skies Treaty:  The Administration objects to section 1244, which would change the reporting requirement to provide an assessment to Congress on Russian proposals to introduce new or modified sensors or aircraft from 30 days to 90 days prior to the United States certifying the aircraft or sensors.  The 90-days requirement is impractical as it is only 30 days after we will be informed of Russia\u2019s notification of intent to certify, generally before analyses are completed.  The Administration also objects to section 1265, which would limit the availability of Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds for arms control implementation in the Air Force until the Secretary of Defense reports to Congress on issues related to the Open Skies Treaty.  The provision could affect the ability of the United States to modernize its observation 4  aircraft sensors by delaying funding needed to upgrade from wet film to digital sensors.  Missile Defense Programs:  While appreciating the Committee\u2019s support of DOD\u2019s ballistic missile defense programs, the Administration objects to section 1668 requiring a concurrent anti-air warfare capability at the Aegis Ashore site in Poland and Romania by 2018.  This requirement would entail hardware and software upgrades not previously planned and would introduce additional costs and potentially delay the deployment in Poland.  Installing this capability would also require amending previously negotiated agreements with the host nation as well as extensive discussions with our NATO Allies.  The Administration also objects to the requirement that a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery be available for rotational deployment to U.S. European Command\u2019s area of responsibility.  This requirement would constrain DOD\u2019s flexibility in managing these high-demand/low-density assets.  The Administration objects to the section 1401 authorization of $30 million in FY 2016 for the planning and design of an East Coast missile field.  The authorization is premature and other missile defense requirements have higher priority.  The Administration objects to the requirement of section 1673 to homeport the Sea-based X-band (SBX) radar on the East Coast in 2020, which does not take into consideration the threat environment or cost and may constrain DOD\u2019s ability to best defend the United States.   Alternative Fuels:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 315 and 316, which would impede DOD\u2019s use of alternative fuels.  Sections 315 and 316 would impede efforts to foster a diverse, cost-competitive energy supply that enhances energy security for both military uses and civilian aviation.  Section 315, which would exempt DOD from section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, undercuts a law passed with strong bipartisan support that provides an environmentally sound framework for the development of future alternative fuels.  Section 316, which would prevent the Secretary of Defense from entering into contracts to construct biofuels refineries, would restrict DOD\u2019s discretion to support the development of drop-in alternative military fuels to improve fuel diversity, increase operational flexibility, and manage budgetary risks associated with oil prices.  A diverse approach to energy security - one that includes both conventional and new sources - would benefit the economy and enhance our military capability.  Additional Requirements for Streamlining of Department of Defense Management Headquarters: While the Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s support for the Department\u2019s plan to reduce headquarters personnel and spending by 20 percent, the Administration strongly objects to section 905 as unnecessary.  The Department\u2019s execution of then-Secretary of Defense Hagel\u2019s Department-wide 20 percent headquarters reduction plan projects savings of $5.3 billion.  These cuts were incorporated into the President\u2019s FY 2016 Budget and will continue through FY 2019.  Section 905 also is overly restrictive in scope because it targets the National Capital Region and exempts DOD civilians whose salaries are funded from the Defense Working Capital Fund.  This could have a profound impact on personnel and cause arbitrary across-the-board cuts.  Level of Readiness of Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) Carriers:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1084, which would severely constrain DOD\u2019s flexibility in managing the military airlift system by effectively requiring the Department to set aside a projected minimum amount of business for commercial air carriers without prior considerations of the impacts on military readiness.  DOD\u2019s management of commercial air carrier support ensures commercial augmentation must not be at the expense of the operational readiness of organic military airlift.  However, section 1084 would mandate a consultative - and inherently conflicting - role for industry in apportioning business between commercial and organic resources, inhibiting military 5  airlift readiness, the military airlift system, and DOD\u2019s ability to rapidly respond to emerging airlift requirements.  Requirement to Provide Certain Documents to Congress:  The Administration objects to section 1061, which would require the provision of summaries of defense planning guidance and contingency planning guidance to Congress.  Release of these summaries outside the Executive Branch could detrimentally affect the Department\u2019s programs by interfering with the ability of the President and the Secretary of Defense to give direction to subordinate military commanders and by compromising the candor and confidentiality of the advice given to the Secretary of Defense.  Congressional Notification of Sensitive Military Operations:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1032, which modifies section 130f of title 10, United States Code, by striking the explicit Afghanistan exception to the notification requirement for sensitive military operations.  Afghanistan continues to be regarded as an area of active hostilities.  The counterterrorism mission to defeat the remnants of al-Qa\u2019ida is ongoing, in addition to operations to prevent attacks by other extremist groups threatening U.S. forces and personnel in Afghanistan.  This amendment would place an undue burden on the Executive branch, which already reports extensively to Congress on U.S. operations in Afghanistan.  Restriction on Retirement of the A-10:  The Administration strongly objects to section 133, which is inconsistent with DOD\u2019s fiscal constraints and current priorities.  Section 133 would restrict DOD from obligating or expending funds to retire A-10 aircraft as well as require a study by an independent agency focusing on what capabilities should be included in an A-10 replacement.  The retirement restriction puts at risk needed recapitalization efforts impacting the acquisition and manning of the Air Force fighter enterprise.  Additionally, the study specifies capability thresholds that may or may not be valid in future conflicts.  DOD believes the Joint Strike Fighter and other multi-mission aircraft will replace the A-10\u2019s singular mission of close air support while also providing other critical capabilities.   Modernization of Ticonderoga Class Cruisers:  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee\u2019s restrictions on the Department\u2019s plan to modernize its Ticonderoga Class Cruisers.  The Committee\u2019s provision would erase planned savings of $300 million to $400 million, result in early depletion of Ship Modernization, Operations and Sustainment Fund funds, and accelerate the retirement of the cruisers.  The Administration also strongly objects to the provision restricting the removal of ballistic missile defense capability from the cruisers.  Maintaining this capability on cruisers will prevent scheduled combat systems upgrades, and upgrading the ballistic missile defense capability will increase overall modernization costs and delay the Navy\u2019s cruiser modernization.  National Guard Civil and Defense Support Activities and Related Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to section 515, which would authorize Governors and Adjutants General of the various States to expend DOD funds to employ the National Guard of their States to perform support operations, missions, or activities in support of a civil authority of a State or Federal agency.  This unwarranted intrusion on the authorities of the President and the Secretary of Defense would impose significant fiscal burdens on an already tight defense budget in order to fund non-defense missions, expose DOD to legal and fiscal risks for missions not under its control, and circumvent the national response system.  6  Limitation on Project Authorization to Carry Out Certain FY 2016 Projects:  The Administration objects to section 2310, which would limit expending funds associated with the construction of Joint Intelligence Analysis Complex Consolidation (JIAC), Phase 2, at Royal Air Force Croughton, United Kingdom, and would limit action to realign forces at Lajes Field, Azores, until the Department conveys specific information to the Committee.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress on this issue in order to avoid the potential for significant financial costs during a period of constrained resources, uncertainty among our allies that share equities in the JIAC, and disruption in intelligence support to the warfighter.  Prohibition on Per Diem Allowance Reductions Based on the Duration of Temporary Duty Assignment or Civilian Travel:  The Administration objects to section 602, which would prohibit a reduced rate of per diem for uniformed service members and DOD civilian employees based on the duration of travel.  This prohibition, which applies only to DOD, is counterproductive to a growing government-wide trend toward implementing flat rate per diem for long-term travel.  Section 602 would nullify an evidence-based policy decision that fairly compensates DOD travelers, demonstrates the Department\u2019s stewardship of taxpayer funds, and meets external mandates to simplify travel and reduce costs.  It also would negate an estimated $81.5 million in annual programmed savings and would produce additional contingency travel costs while imposing an unfunded annual requirement on the military departments.  Unrequested Funding:  In this fiscally constrained environment, the Administration objects to the authorization of billions of dollars of unnecessary funding offset by equal cuts to higher priority items requested in the President\u2019s Budget.  Unrequested items include $1.15 billion for extra F/A-18 aircraft, $1 billion for extra Joint Strike Fighters, $683 million to keep A-10 aircraft,  $128 million for extra UH-60 helicopters, and $722 million to reverse planned savings associated with compensation reform proposals to slow the growth in basic housing allowance payments and to reform commissary operations.  The Administration has made extensive efforts to assess, prioritize, and balance force capacity, capability, and readiness in developing the FY 2016 Budget.  Extra programs inserted in the budget come at the expense of programs that are more important, and will create ripple effects across the rest of the budget. Operation and Maintenance and Military Personnel Reductions:  The Administration objects to the billions of dollars of undistributed reductions in the bill across the operation and maintenance and military personnel accounts.  The operation and maintenance reductions would be applied to those programs funded in section 4301, which include readiness, depot maintenance, base operations support, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions will delay the Department\u2019s full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of maintenance at the military departments\u2019 depot facilities.  Restrictions on the Overhaul and Repair of Naval Vessels in Foreign Shipyards:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1021, which would prohibit the Navy from proceeding with planned overhaul, repair, or maintenance efforts with a duration of more than six months, which are scheduled to be accomplished in foreign shipyards on ships whose homeports are not in the United States or Guam.  This restriction on Forward Deployed Naval Force ships would reduce operational availability and increase costs due to the transit time to the United States or Guam, and negatively affect Sailors\u2019 quality of life by subjecting them to extended separations from their families.  Alternatively, changing ship homeports would cause harm to Sailors and their families by requiring earlier and more frequent relocations.  7  Unified Medical Command:  The Administration strongly objects to section 711, which would direct DOD to establish a Unified Medical Command (UMC).  In addition to already possessing the necessary authorities to organize its medical forces, past reviews by the Department have concluded a UMC is not in the best interest of the Department.  In order to best balance oversight from the Office of the Secretary of Defense with the Services\u2019 mission needs, the Department believes that the current organizational construct contained in the Defense Health Agency is optimal.  The establishment of a UMC would likely impose significant costs without realizing efficiencies or savings.  Proposed Realignments of Military Medical Treatment Facilities:  The Administration objects to section 713, which would require a mandatory 90-day waiting period before restructuring or realigning a military treatment facility and impose a burdensome reporting requirement.  As the Army, for example, draws down end strength, it must have the flexibility to realign medical capabilities corresponding to end strength levels.  Keeping medical personnel at underutilized facilities directly impacts the ability to properly resource fully utilized facilities and to have our medical providers maintain their clinical skills.  Any delay would adversely affect medical readiness and clinical proficiency to the detriment of our Soldiers and their families.  Landmines:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1057, which would limit the availability of funds for the destruction of anti-personnel landmines.  This provision would interfere with DOD\u2019s ability to dispose of unneeded munitions and undermine the Administration\u2019s policy of working to eliminate anti-personnel landmine stockpiles other than those required for the defense of the Republic of Korea. Limitation on Service Secretary Revocation of Combat Valor Awards:  The Administration objects to section 582, which would infringe on the authority of the military service Secretaries to revoke certain combat valor awards.  Such a limitation would create a disconnect with the authority vested in the Secretaries to approve valor awards.  Current provisions of title 10, that prohibit award or presentation of valor medals to a person whose continuous and on-going service has not been honorable, protect the integrity of awards by ensuring that they are not given to those who might demand the benefits of the award even after engaging in heinous criminal acts, such as hostile acts against the United States and sexual assault.   Disposition of Weapons-Usable Plutonium:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3116, which would require the Secretary of Energy to carry out construction and project support activities for the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility.  This language is unnecessarily restrictive and would preclude alternative, and potentially more cost-effective approaches to implementing U.S. commitments in the 2000 Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement and its 2010 annex to dispose of excess weapons plutonium.  The Department of Energy (DOE) contracted for an independent validation of costs for plutonium disposition alternatives in accordance with congressional mandates.  Based on the first phase of this analysis, the remaining costs for disposing of plutonium using the MOX approach exceed $47 billion, which is over $22 billion more than the preliminary estimates done in 2014.  The results of this analysis will inform the Administration's approach to plutonium disposition.   Nuclear Weapons Dismantlement:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3121, which would limit funding for nuclear weapons dismantlement.  It restricts the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate stockpile adjustments to meet national security goals and runs counter to the Nation\u2019s commitments in support of the goals of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Requiring the President to certify that any dismantlement is for a life extension program 8  constrains our ability to respond expeditiously to the needs of the stockpile.  Additionally, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) already provides annually, in the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, dismantlement accomplishments and plans for the future.  Nonproliferation Technology Development:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3120, which would limit funds for nonproliferation or arms control verification or monitoring technologies from being used to develop technologies beyond technology readiness level (TRL) 5 unless certain requirements are met.  NNSA activities span the full range of TRLs, from basic research to production and deployment.  As drafted, this language would significantly impede development of all high TRL work including:  space-based nuclear detonation detection; advanced radiation detection; nuclear safeguards; emergency response and verification; and monitoring technology.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) can only meet its mission if it has state-of-the-art safeguards approaches and technologies.  This is particularly important as we look forward to the IAEA\u2019s safeguards implementation responsibilities. Authorization of Production of Special Nuclear Material Outside the United States by Foreign Country with Nuclear Naval Propulsion Program:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3119, which would limit and condition authorizations under 10 CFR Part 810 of technology transfers and assistance to countries that have a naval nuclear propulsion program.  Countries with such programs include generally authorized countries such as the United Kingdom, France, and Brazil, as well as countries like Russia, China, and India, for which specific authorization is required.  The Secretary would be prohibited from issuing authorizations with respect to such countries until the Director of National Intelligence and the Chief of Naval Operations submit an assessment to the specified committees of the risks of diversion of such nuclear technology transfer to a country\u2019s naval nuclear propulsion program, even if the technology or assistance has no relationship to or utility in naval propulsion.  Halting these authorizations would have a significant negative financial impact on the U.S. nuclear industry and on diplomatic relations between the United States and the impacted countries.  Fixed Site Radiation Portal Monitors:  The Administration objects to section 3117, which would prohibit use of FY 2016 and subsequent fiscal year funds for research and development, installation, or sustainment of fixed site radiological portal monitors or equipment in foreign countries.  This prohibition would preclude maintenance, training, and gradual transition to indigenous support for equipment to detect potential trafficking in nuclear and radiological materials, an important element of the U.S. multi-faceted strategy to interdict materials outside of regulatory control.  It would also negatively impact U.S. relationships and cooperation with foreign partners to prevent proliferation of nuclear and radiological materials.  Personnel Levels:  The Administration objects to section 3111, which would limit the size of the NNSA Federal workforce needed to provide necessary program and project guidance and oversight to execute nuclear security programs.  NNSA must have the ability to recruit, hire, and retain a highly skilled Federal workforce that includes an appropriate mix of competitive and excepted service in order to fulfill its mission consistent with programmatic requirements.  The cap on Federal competitive staffing unduly restricts NNSA's flexibility and places at risk the appropriate, and inherently governmental Federal oversight and management of critical programs. Transfer of Nonoperational Facilities:  The Administration objects to section 3141, which would require the transfer of NNSA excess facilities within three years to the Environmental Management (EM) program for decontaminating and decommissioning (D&D).  In January 9  2015, the Secretary established a working group that is already developing an analysis and options for how the Department may prioritize and address the numerous contaminated excess facilities owned by the various DOE program offices.  The path forward for disposition of these facilities should be determined through this ongoing analysis and appropriate planning, not a required three-year timeline for transfer.  Although the Administration agrees that high-risk, excess facilities should be \u201cdispositioned\u201d quickly, safely, and cost-effectively, section 3141 would not address the underlying issue of risk because the Department is unable to undertake D&D of all of these facilities in the foreseeable future due to ongoing mission requirements and enforceable regulatory cleanup commitments.  Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund:  The Administration objects to section 4701, which would eliminate the authorization of appropriations for the contribution to the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund.  This funding is critical to the Administration\u2019s proposal to reauthorize the Fund to address the significant shortfall in resources allocated for cleanup of shutdown uranium enrichment plants that supported nuclear weapons production and commercial power generation. Greater Sage-Grouse and Public Land Management:  The Administration strongly objects to section 2862, which would mandate a delay until 2025 in listing or deciding not to list the Greater Sage-Grouse under the Endangered Species Act and would effectively override longstanding principles of major Federal land management statues, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and the National Forest Management Act.  Such unprecedented delays undermine science-based decision-making, are unnecessary for military readiness, and are ill-advised for purposes of public land management.  Such delays create uncertainty for landowners and businesses, and effectively suspend unprecedented collaborative conservation efforts that have been developed with extensive public input.  Additional provisions would divest stewardship of Federal land from Federal agencies, requiring these lands to be managed consistent with State-approved management plans.  Moreover, existing law already allows the Secretary of Defense to obtain an exemption of any action from the requirements of the Endangered Species Act for reasons of national security. The National Historic Preservation Act:  The Administration objects to section 2853, which would amend the National Historic Preservation Act to allow Federal agencies to object to a designation of Federal properties for reasons of national security.  Listing a property on the National Register of Historic Places, or designating it as a National Historic Landmark, does not limit any Federal agency\u2019s decision-making authority.  Decisions on how to manage the property, informed by the evaluation of its significance and integrity, remain the responsibility of the agency with jurisdiction over that property.  The Administration is not aware of any specific instance where such a designation has adversely affected national security.  Enactment of this section could lead to a fundamental weakening of highly successful and widely admired programs that Congress intended to help recognize and protect our shared heritage. Military Land Withdrawals:  The Administration has concerns with the bill\u2019s provisions relating to military land withdrawals.  The responsible agencies will continue to coordinate to facilitate responsible use of public lands to support military readiness, training, and testing, acknowledging the current system of periodic legislative re-withdrawals is not particularly efficient and does not provide for the optimum land management regime.  But, the Administration is not prepared to support transfers of such lands without a process that provides careful consideration of the evolving needs, interests, and any supporting legislative provisions.  The Administration stands ready to consider measures and approaches to make the use of public 10  lands for military needs more efficient. The Annual Compliance Report:  The Administration has concerns with section 1262 as it vests in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence functions for which the Department of State has lead responsibility, specifically regarding international compliance with arms control and nonproliferation agreements and commitments.  The Department of State is uniquely positioned to provide policy and legal expertise on a range of complex arms control compliance issues and already has the responsibility to prepare an annual report on such compliance.  Special Immigrant Visas (SIV):  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s indication of support for continuation of the Afghan SIV program, but is concerned about the absence of authority to provide additional visas for this program in the bill.  The Administration proposes an additional 5,000 visas for FY 2016.  The SIV program enables Afghan nationals who have aided U.S. efforts through their work, and who have experienced or are experiencing an ongoing serious threat as a result, to apply for these visas.  The Administration strongly supports extension of this program and looks forward to working with Congress to enact the President\u2019s proposal.  Maritime Security Fleet:  The Administration objects to section 3504, which could significantly reduce the U.S. Government\u2019s oversight of vessels of the Maritime Security Fleet by placing the primary responsibility for ensuring fleet readiness with classification societies, some of which are foreign-owned and foreign-controlled.  Since 2013, there have been 27 documented cases of nonconformities for lifesaving, firefighting, or environmental conditions aboard vessels that classification societies certified; of these, 55 percent were discovered by the Coast Guard after certification and directed back to the classification society for remediation.  By restricting the Secretary\u2019s discretion to guarantee the fleet\u2019s readiness to carry critical military cargo at all times, section 3504 would leave the U.S. Government reliant on domestic and foreign classification societies to perform necessary inspections and, by extension, to certify that these vessels meet the U.S. Government's requirements for national security operations. * * * * * * * 11  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1644, which would delay for at least three years updated regulations, known as the Stream Protection Rule, to protect streams from the effects of destructive surface coal mining practices.  Such a needless delay of these important safeguards would impact the communities and economies that depend on clean water and a healthy environment.  The current stream protection requirements governing surface mining activities are more than 30 years old and do not incorporate significant advances in scientific knowledge and mining and reclamation techniques.  An arbitrary three year restriction to block the updated modern, science-based regulations would significantly impair the ability of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) to accomplish the mission and responsibilities the Congress laid out in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, including preserving clean water, human health, and the environment.   H.R. 1644 would prevent the restoration of hundreds of streams, result in deterioration of water quality for thousands of stream miles, and create sustained regulatory uncertainty, as well as public health impacts for downstream communities.  In addition, the bill would impose arbitrary requirements and unnecessary processes that would seriously impede OSMRE's ability to use the best available science to protect public health and the environment.   If the President were presented with H.R. 1644, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S. 1558, making appropriations for the Department of Defense (DOD) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The Administration supports investments essential to execute the President's national security and defense strategies, and appreciates the Committee's recognition that increased resources are needed for national defense.  However, the bill drastically underfunds critical investments in DOD's base budget and instead uses Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for base requirements in ways that leaders in both parties have made clear are inappropriate.  Base budget sequestration levels will damage our ability to restore readiness, advance badly-needed technological modernization, and keep faith with our troops and their families.  Meanwhile, shifting base budget resources into OCO risks undermining a mechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts and fails to provide a stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning and fiscal policy are based.  The use of OCO funding to circumvent budget caps in defense spending also ignores the long-term connection between national security and economic security and fails to account for vital national security functions carried out at non-defense agencies.  In addition, the bill fails to support many of the needed force structure and weapons system reforms included in the President's Budget, and undermines a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round that would allow DOD to properly align the military's infrastructure with the needs of its evolving force.  The President's defense strategy depends on investing every dollar where it will have the greatest effect, which the Administration's fiscal year (FY) 2016 proposals will accomplish through critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, slow growth in compensation, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The Committee's changes would constrain the ability of DOD to align military capability and force structure with the President's defense strategy, and would require the Department to retain unnecessary force structure and weapons systems that cannot be adequately resourced in today's fiscal environment, contributing to a military that will be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.  The bill also includes unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay.  If the President were presented with S.1558, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.     Enacting S. 1558, while adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending limits for FY 2016, would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-class priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to threaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be motivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts would result in tens  of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and thousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and grants, adversely impacting the pace of discovery and innovation, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.    Sequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only through pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland Security, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of the economy and the security of the Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear that he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense without also fixing non-defense.  The President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto S. 1558 and any other legislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the investments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense priorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both parties have urged.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Defense  Sequestration and Misuse of OCO Funds.  The Administration strongly objects to the sequestration-level for the appropriations in the bill for items that were requested in and belong in the base budget, as well as the use of OCO\u2014a funding mechanism intended to pay for wars and not subject to the budget caps\u2014to pay for $36 billion in base requirements.  Sequestration adds risk to our national security by threatening the size, readiness, presence, and capability of our military, and threatens the economic security on which our national security depends.  The Committee clearly recognizes that increased investment in defense is needed, but proposes to fund it by circumventing instead of increasing the budget caps.  This approach fails to provide the stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning is based; undermines a mechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts; locks in unacceptable funding cuts for national security activities at non-defense agencies such as the Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs; and weakens national security by undermining the Nation's economic security.  Guantanamo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 8100, 8101, and 8102 of the bill, which would restrict the Executive Branch's ability to manage the detainee population at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility.  Sections 8100 and 8101 would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States, except in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA for FY 2016).  Section 8102 would restrict detainee transfers abroad in accordance with the NDAA for FY 2016.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions.  Operating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens our national security by draining 2  resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Sections 8100 and 8102 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles in certain circumstances.  Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC).  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress and MCRMC to improve our military compensation and retirement systems, and encourages the Congress to support the additional recommendations for which the Administration has transmitted legislation.  The Administration strongly supports enacting a Blended Retirement System, which would ensure that 85 percent of servicemembers receive Government contributions toward their retirement\u2014compared to fewer than 20 percent under the current system, provide DOD with better tools to recruit and retain the All-Volunteer Force, and produce significant savings over the long term. The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress and MCRMC on other provisions, to meet our solemn responsibility to ensure that any changes protect the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer Force, improve quality-of-life for servicemembers and their families, and safeguard the fiscal sustainability of the military compensation and retirement systems.  Compensation Reform.  The FY 2016 Budget request provides the funding and common-sense reforms that will ensure that servicemembers receive competitive pay and benefits and critical training and equipment.  These proposals would save $1.7 billion in FY 2016 and $18 billion through FY 2020.  The Administration appreciates the Senate's support of DOD's efforts to slow the growth of basic pay and housing allowances and strongly encourages members of the Congress to support all of DOD's requested compensation reforms.  Prohibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Round.  The Administration strongly objects to the proposed $10.5 million reduction to funds that would support a 2017 BRAC round.  This reduction would impair the ability of the Executive Branch to plan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which would allow DOD to right-size its infrastructure while providing important assistance to affected communities, freeing resources currently consumed by maintaining unneeded facilities.  In the absence of authorization of a new round of BRAC, the Administration will pursue alternative options to reduce this wasteful spending and ensure that DOD's limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security.  A-10 Aircraft.  The Administration objects to the additional $467 million for unneeded A-10 aircraft, which is inconsistent with DOD's fiscal constraints and current priorities.  Funding the A-10 above the requested amount puts at risk the future health of the Air Force fighter enterprise and $4.7 billion in savings through FY 2019.  DOD needs to focus its resources on the Joint Strike Fighter and other multi-mission aircraft, which will replace the A-10's singular mission of close air support while also providing other critical capabilities.  Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI).  The Administration strongly objects to section 8106 of the bill, which limits the transfer of AH-64 Apache helicopters to 36 until 60 days after the release of 3  the National Commission of the Future of the Army report.  This delay in transfers would negatively affect the Army's readiness and ability to prepare and deploy forces for ongoing operations.  The FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) established limitations on the ARI, but provided for the transfer of certain numbers of aircraft in time for congressional review of the report of the Commission on the Future of the Army before transfer of additional aircraft.  Delaying the transfer until the passage of the FY 2016 NDAA would damage the readiness of Army units in the 1st Infantry Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in October 2015, the 25th Infantry Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in February 2016, and the 10th Mountain Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in June 2016.  The remaining combat aviation brigades would bear the rotational burden of meeting current and projected operational requirements around the world, and would be forced to increase operational tempo and deploy-to-dwell ratios for these low-density, high demand units.  The National Guard Bureau has developed a plan for the transfer of the first 48 AH-64 Apaches as well as a plan to receive the first 20 UH-60 Blackhawks.  DOD's plan for the transfer of select numbers of aircraft between the components in FY 2016 is in compliance with the FY 2015 NDAA and is the same as the number of Apache aircraft (72) that the National Guard Bureau agreed to transfer in its aviation proposal.  These new limitations also would likely lead to a significant reduction of AH-64D inductions into the AH-64E remanufacturing facility in Mesa, Arizona and affect supporting activities in Huntsville, Alabama, and elsewhere.  The Administration urges the Congress to permit the transfer of 72 Apache aircraft in FY 2016.  Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF).  The Administration strongly objects to the reduction of $1.1 billion of CTPF and the limitations imposed on the Fund, which would severely restrict the flexibility and resources required to empower and enable partners in responding to shared terrorist threats around the world.  For the CTPF to build partner capacity effectively, funds need to remain available for two years in order to support the acquisition of long-lead equipment some partner nations require.  Without the needed resources and multi-year flexibility, the important security assistance programs begun in FY 2015 would be in jeopardy.  The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to appropriate the $2.1 billion originally requested and remove unnecessary limitations to continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2016.  Rocket Engine Development.  The Administration strongly objects to the $144 million in unrequested and unnecessary funding for a new Government-developed rocket engine.  The Administration is committed to transitioning from non-allied engines; however, an engine-centric approach as provided for in this bill would not preserve the Nation's assured access to space.  While rocket engines are a major component of a launch vehicle, they are only one of many critical components.  Developing a rocket propulsion system independent of the rest of the space launch system risks the Government investing hundreds of millions of dollars without ensuring the availability of operational launch systems.  Sound systems engineering principles and over a half-century of launch vehicle design work demonstrate that a rocket propulsion system must be developed in conjunction with the rest of the space launch vehicle.  This unnecessary funding comes at the expense of more important programs, and would create ripple effects across the rest of the budget.  Defense Meteorological Satellite Program.  The Administration strongly objects to the elimination of all funding for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-20 and its launch.  By 2017, only one DMSP satellite will be within its design life.  DOD has certified that this fully-built and recently-refurbished satellite is a cost-effective solution to the expected 4  shortfall in polar-orbiting weather satellites, which the Government Accountability Office has chronicled in its High Risk List.  Because weather satellite data are shared among defense, intelligence, civil, and international users, eliminating this satellite would have broad implications, including reduced accuracy of weather prediction models and degraded efficiency of surveillance and reconnaissance platforms.  Unrequested Funding.  In this fiscally constrained environment, the Administration strongly objects to the billions of dollars provided for items that were not in the FY 2016 Budget request, offset by reductions to higher priority items that the military needs.  Unrequested items include $828 million for 10 extra Joint Strike Fighters (after assuming $409 million in uncertain program savings), $1.1 billion to reverse planned savings associated with compensation reform proposals, $1 billion of OCO funds for National Guard and Reserve Equipment, $1 billion in incremental funding for an Arleigh Burke (DDG 51) destroyer, $225 million to fund an additional Joint High Speed Vessel, $250 million of Advance Procurement funding for the Navy's amphibious warship replacement program, and $31 million to fund Operation Phalanx.  The Administration has made extensive efforts to assess, prioritize, and balance force capacity, capability, and readiness.  The FY 2016 Budget supports the defense strategy and rebalances the Joint Force for the Nation's current and future security challenges.  The Administration also objects to section 8006 of the bill, which places spending on unrequested items into statute.  Operation and Maintenance and Military Personnel Reductions.  The Administration objects to the billions of dollars of undistributed reductions in the bill across the operation and maintenance and military personnel accounts.  The operation and maintenance reductions would be applied to those programs that support readiness, depot maintenance, base operations support, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions would delay the Department's full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of maintenance at the military departments' depot facilities.  Defense Health Program.  The Administration strongly objects to the $786 million reduction in Defense Health Program Operation and Maintenance funding.  Military medicine has had dramatic cost increases in FY 2015, and overall costs are projected to rise.  DOD has taken aggressive action, where possible, to address these cost increases.  However, ensuring the health of the force and their families, along with upholding our commitment to retirees will be increasingly difficult, absent sufficient funding at the level established in the President's Budget request.  Without funding at the level requested, the Department will be forced to reduce or eliminate needed medical support programs and initiatives.   Aircraft Carrier Replacement Program.  The Administration objects to the bill's $191.5 million reduction to the Department of the Navy's Aircraft Carrier Replacement Program, ship construction account.  This funding reduction would present unacceptable risk to CVN 80 being delivered on schedule and would result in a significant increase to the ship's cost.  With respect to previous Ford-class aircraft carrier funding profiles, CVN 80 incorporates a reduced advanced procurement funding profile thus exacerbating the impact of the proposed funding reduction to this ship.  A delay in delivering CVN 80 would result in unacceptable risk in the Department of the Navy's aircraft carrier force structure by causing a gap that reduces the force level below congressionally mandated requirements.  Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mine Countermeasures Mission and Remote Minehunting System Packages.  The Administration objects to the proposed $104.5 million in reductions to LCS 5  Mission Module procurement, including LCS Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Mission Package (MP), Remote Minehunting System (RMS), Shallow Water MCM and LCS Common Mission Modules Equipment programs.  These reductions would leave the programs with insufficient funds to procure needed MCM equipment in the quantity required to deploy LCS with MCM MPs in FYs 2018-2020, resulting in a warfighting gap in the Middle East.  The Navy would be required to extend operations of aging MCM class ships and MH-53 systems at additional operating and sustainment expense.  All testing will be completed prior to FY 2016 planned procurements.  The MCM MP reduction would also lead to increased unit costs in component mission systems impacting multiple production lines.  The Navy's procurement profiles carefully balance risk to meet testing needs and provide improved MCM capability to the Fleet.  MQ-4 Triton Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.  The Administration objects to the reduction of  $152 million from the Triton program that reduces the low rate initial production procurement by one aircraft in FY 2016 and associated advanced procurement for two aircraft.  In the FY 2016 President's Budget request the quantity of aircraft was reduced for FY 2016 and FY 2017 from four to three aircraft for each year.  Further reduction of the quantities to two aircraft each year would increase the aircraft cost by as much as 30 percent due to suboptimal economic order quantities.  In addition, this reduction would delay Triton Initial operational capability.  Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF).  The Administration objects to the elimination of the base funding request of $99.7 million.  This funding is critical to the Department's ability to quickly respond to urgent operational needs.  Eliminating these funds may directly lead to unnecessary risks to servicemembers and their ability to accomplish critical missions.  Missile Defense Programs.  The Administration objects to the $149.3 million in total funding reductions to ballistic missile defense programs.  The Administration opposes the $12.3 million reduction to the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications program, which is needed to meet the President's European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase III, as well as the $22.4 million reduction to the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) program, which would negatively affect the warfighter by delaying delivery of automated engagement coordination between THAAD and Aegis by 12 months.  The Administration also opposes the Senate-proposed reduction of $63.8 million to missile defense technology development programs and $50.8 million for Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Special Programs that are needed to ensure the United States stays ahead of future ballistic missile threats.  These reductions would significantly harm MDA's ability to develop a mid-term discrimination capability, directed energy programs and other classified activities needed to defend friends and allies and address evolving threats against the homeland.  Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support of meaningful launch competition.  For example, section 8045 would improve assured access to space and provide significant savings to the taxpayer.  However, the Administration objects to the rescission of $125 million that would eliminate a competitive launch opportunity in FY 2015.  The Air Force is committed to increasing the number of competitions and the request for proposal is planned for release in FY 2015.  The Administration urges the Committee to support improving assured access to space and allow this competition.   Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the DATA Act by fully funding the FY 2016 Budget request for the Department of Defense to implement the Act.  This funding will support the 6  Department's efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and employing a uniform procurement instrument identifier.  Classified Programs.  The Administration looks forward to providing its views on the adjustments contained in the Classified Annex to the bill once it becomes available.   Additional Constitutional Concerns.  Several other provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, section 8071 and language in title IX may interfere with the President's authority as Commander in Chief and section 8009 could interfere with the President's authority with regard to sensitive national security information.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *     7  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4775, the Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2016, because it would significantly undermine Clean Air Act (CAA) protections, would block efforts to reduce harmful ground-level ozone pollution in communities across the country, and could delay future scientific reviews for other harmful pollutants.   Ozone pollution, also known as smog, has been linked to a range of adverse health effects which can lead to missed work and school days, increased hospital admissions, and premature deaths from respiratory and cardiovascular causes.  H.R. 4775 would delay implementation of the 2015 ozone health standard that will otherwise improve air quality for millions of Americans.  This would result in people living in areas with unhealthy ozone levels for at least an additional 10 years.  The bill also would unnecessarily extend deadlines for science-based reviews of all National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) from 5 to 10 years\u2014delaying for 5 years the requirement that the latest science inform our air pollution standards.  Further, the bill would make other detrimental changes to the NAAQS core protections\u2014most significantly allowing a fundamental shift away from the principle that the standards should be based solely on public health and welfare considerations.  As a result, H.R. 4775 would jeopardize progress toward cleaner air and significantly delay health benefits worth billions of dollars for millions of Americans, including those most vulnerable\u2014children, older adults, and people with asthma.  As required by the CAA, the Environmental Protection Agency sets primary air quality standards that protect public health with an \"adequate margin of safety,\" including the health of at-risk groups.  These science-based air standards, which undergo rigorous public review and comment, have a proven record of success.  They have resulted in cleaner air which has helped all Americans live longer, healthier lives in a growing economy.  In fact, since 1970, emissions of key pollutants have decreased by nearly 70 percent while the economy has tripled in size.  H.R. 4775 would undermine the vitally important environmental and health protections of the CAA.  If the President were presented with H.R. 4775, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort that produced this legislation and wants to work with the Senate and House on a bipartisan basis to ensure that important changes are made to protect the most vulnerable students.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to make these critical changes to S. 1177 before the bill is presented to the President for signature.  The Administration supports the commitment in S. 1177 to holding all students to challenging academic standards, maintaining critical provisions that ensure teachers and parents know how students are performing every year, providing states and school districts with the flexibility needed for schools to improve outcomes for students, and providing additional transparency around resource and opportunity gaps.  The Administration appreciates that S. 1177 would allow for critical investments in innovation and what works and excludes harmful provisions that would divert resources away from students, schools, and districts with the greatest economic needs.  The Administration applauds the bipartisan commitment in S. 1177 to expand opportunities for America\u2019s children to attend high-quality preschool.  In order to continue ESEA\u2019s legacy of equity and opportunity for every child in America, the Administration strongly urges revisions during Senate consideration of S. 1177 that would strengthen school accountability to close troubling achievement and opportunity gaps, including by requiring interventions and supports in the lowest-performing five percent of schools, in other schools where subgroups of students are not achieving, and in high schools where too many students do not graduate.  Parents, families, and communities deserve to know that when children fall behind, their schools will take action to improve.  Changes also are needed to S. 1177 to ensure that the Department of Education has the authority to implement the ESEA so that it works as intended to protect at-risk students and to provide accountability for taxpayer funds.    The Administration also urges changes during Senate consideration of S. 1177 that would cap the amount of time spent annually on standardized testing and that would require parental notification when testing is consuming too much classroom learning time.  S. 1177 should also be improved to better support America\u2019s teachers and principals and to deliver the resources and resource equity needed to strengthen our Nation\u2019s schools, including by requiring states to develop plans to address resource inequities and closing the longstanding \u201ccomparability\u201d loophole to provide needed resources to vulnerable students in Title I schools.   The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress on a bipartisan approach to replace NCLB with a law that expands opportunity for all of America\u2019s children.   *  *  *  *  *  *  2  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they are tailored to advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that they minimize uncertainty.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 185, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2015.  The Regulatory Accountability Act would impose unprecedented and unnecessary procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from efficiently performing their statutory responsibilities.  It would also create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty and further impede the implementation protections for the American public.  This bill would make the regulatory process more expensive, less flexible, and more burdensome -- dramatically increasing the cost of regulation for the American taxpayer and working class families.    The Regulatory Accountability Act would impose unnecessary new procedures on agencies and invite frivolous litigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, it must already adhere to the requirements of the statute that it is implementing.  In many cases, the  Congress has mandated that an agency issue a particular rule or regulation, and it often prescribes the process an agency must follow.  Agencies must also adhere to the robust and well-understood procedural and analytical requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act.  Furthermore, agency rulemaking has long been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties. These Executive Orders require that agencies promulgate regulations only after considering regulatory alternatives, determining that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs, and establishing that the new regulations encourage regulatory flexibility.  Lastly, any final regulation is subject to judicial review to ensure that agencies satisfy the substantive and procedural requirements of all applicable statutes and consider input from the relevant stakeholders.  Passage of H.R. 185 would replace this established framework with layers of additional procedural requirements that would undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory mandates.  It would require cumbersome \u201cformal\u201d rulemaking for a new category of rules, for which agencies would have to conduct quasi-adjudicatory proceedings.  It would require unnecessary Advance Notices, beyond the standard notice and comment already required, for a large number of rules, and other unnecessary procedural steps that seem designed simply to impede the regulatory development process.  It would impose unnecessary new evidentiary standards as a condition of rulemaking.  It would subject the regulatory process to unneeded rounds of litigation.  And the Regulatory Accountability Act would undermine the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to adapt regulatory review to changing circumstances. In these ways and others, the Regulatory Accountability Act would impede the ability of  agencies to provide the public with basic protections, and create needless confusion and delay that would prove disruptive for businesses, as well as for State, tribal, and local governments.  If the President were presented with the Regulatory Accountability Act, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration is committed to addressing the opioid epidemic.  While the Administration welcomes Congressional efforts to elevate the importance of combating the epidemic, the Administration is greatly concerned that, without the resources necessary to prevent opioid addiction and increase access to treatment and recovery services, H.R. 4641, H.R. 5046, and related bills that may be considered simultaneously would do little to help the thousands of Americans struggling with addiction.  Every day that passes without Congressional action to support the treatment needs of those suffering from opioid use disorder is a missed opportunity to help the many communities facing the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.  Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that opioids \u2013 a class of drugs that includes prescription opioid pain medications and heroin \u2013 were involved in 28,647 deaths in 2014.  In addition to high rates of prescription opioid deaths, there have also been alarming increases in deaths from heroin and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.  In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for prescription opioids, which is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of pills.  Further, four in five new heroin users started out by misusing prescription opioid pain medications.  These trends will not change by simply authorizing new grant programs, studies and reports.  Congressional action is needed to fund the tools communities need to confront this epidemic and accelerate important policies like training health care providers on appropriate opioid prescribing, an essential component of this effort.  In February, the Administration submitted a robust proposal to the Congress to provide $1.1 billion in new funding to address this epidemic and expand access to treatment for prescription opioid abuse and heroin use to help individuals with an opioid use disorder seek treatment, successfully complete treatment, and sustain recovery.  This funding also would support the placement of substance use disorder treatment providers in the communities most in need, and would continue to build effective, evidence-based treatment programs.  The President's Budget builds on current efforts to expand prescription drug overdose prevention strategies, improve access to the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, and support targeted enforcement activities.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to secure the funding necessary to ensure that opioid use disorder treatment is available for those who seek it.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 702, which would remove restrictions on the export of crude oil.   Domestic oil production has grown in recent years, strengthening our economy, supporting new American jobs, and enhancing our energy security.  The Administration has taken important steps to support safe and responsible production growth, including actions to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, to protect water quality, and to improve offshore safety in order to protect human lives and the environment from oil spills.   Legislation to remove crude export restrictions is not needed at this time.  Rather, Congress should be focusing its efforts on supporting our transition to a low-carbon economy.  It could do this through a variety of measures, including ending the billions of dollars a year in Federal subsidies provided to oil companies and instead investing in wind, solar, energy efficiency, and other clean technologies to meet America's energy needs.  If the President were presented with H.R. 702, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5143, the Transparent Insurance Standards Act of 2016.  This legislation would roll back critical Wall Street reforms intended to protect American consumers and our financial system.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) created important and necessary changes to regulatory authorities and coordination for the insurance industry.  H.R. 5143 would severely weaken these reforms, which were put in place to enhance insurance industry oversight in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.  The Nation has made great progress as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, and cannot allow this bill to hamper the United States' ability to implement the best standards for our unique regulatory regime.  The restrictions that this legislation seeks to place on United States representatives in international insurance matters under H.R. 5143 would raise serious constitutional concerns and severely outweigh any potential attendant benefits.  Following the 2008 financial crisis, and specifically after the near-collapse of American International Group, Inc. (AIG), the Dodd-Frank Act established a new supervisory and regulatory framework to examine financial stability risks in the insurance industry both domestically and internationally.  The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office (FIO), which is directed in part to \"coordinate federal efforts and develop federal policy on prudential aspects of international insurance matters, including representing the United States, as appropriate, in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and assisting the Secretary in negotiating covered agreements.\"  The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the scope of the Federal Reserve's supervisory authority so that it now serves as the consolidated supervisor of insurance holding companies that own either a Federally chartered thrift or a bank, as well as non-bank financial companies designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  FIO, the Federal Reserve, and state insurance commissioners are all actively engaged at the IAIS and regularly coordinate with one another, ensuring that each aspect of the unique United States regulatory regime is adequately represented in any international negotiation.  Despite their effective coordination and extensive work thus far to improve global insurance regulation, the restrictions which H.R. 5143 seeks to impose would stop this work in its tracks and would put in place cumbersome and counterproductive requirements.  H.R. 5143 would purport to prescribe strict negotiating objectives for United States representatives in international fora regarding international insurance standards, and establish several new processes and reporting requirements to be completed before any standard could be agreed to.  These requirements would contravene the President's exclusive constitutional authority to determine the time, scope, and objectives of international negotiations.  They also would add significant delays and limitations to the process for developing an international insurance capital standard, ultimately weakening the United States' ability to negotiate effectively for standards that best accommodate our unique regulatory regime.   Specifically, under H.R. 5143, FIO and the Federal Reserve would not be allowed to agree to international insurance standards unless, among other things, such standards are first published in the Federal Register and made available for public comment for 30 days.  If this prohibition applied to the mere negotiation and conclusion of such agreements, it would violate the President's exclusive constitutional authority to conduct international negotiations.  Even construed to avoid unconstitutional application, this type of requirement would significantly impair U.S. interests at both the IAIS and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and limit the ability of the United States to influence decisions made at the IAIS, which could result in international insurance standards being adopted that are not in the best interests of U.S. consumers, the U.S. insurance industry, and the U.S. economy.    Furthermore, H.R. 5143 would require the Secretary of the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative to \"consult with and directly include State insurance commissioners\" in negotiation of written bilateral or multilateral agreements regarding insurance or reinsurance.  Although the President may choose to permit such consultation and involvement, as has been done already, the President's authority to determine who will represent the United States in international negotiations is exclusive, and the Congress may not dictate these choices for him.    Finally, the bill would limit the amount available to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through its mandatory Reserve Fund, established by the Dodd-Frank Act.  This cut to SEC resources is completely unrelated to international insurance standards and would negatively impact the SEC's ability to fund the long-term information technology initiatives that are necessary to keep pace with industry's increasing use of new and technologically-complex financial products and services.  Because this legislation seeks to tie the hands of U.S. representatives, in an unconstitutional manner, and prevent them from effectively negotiating on international insurance matters, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5143.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5143, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration's proposal provides a focused approach to facilitate more cybersecurity information sharing while ensuring the protection of individuals' privacy and civil liberties.  As the Administration has previously stated, information sharing legislation must carefully safeguard privacy and civil liberties, preserve the long-standing respective roles and missions of civilian and intelligence agencies, and provide for appropriate sharing with targeted liability protections.  The Administration commends the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on its efforts to craft cybersecurity information sharing legislation and appreciates its efforts to address several of the Administration's most significant concerns.  This work has strengthened the legislation and incorporated important changes to better protect privacy.  Several improvements to the bill are needed to ensure that it appropriately encourages and facilitates information sharing while safeguarding individuals' privacy interests and civil liberties.  As a result, the Administration recognizes the importance of the House and Senate working together to achieve these shared goals and supports House passage of H.R. 1560, so that improvements can be made as the legislative process continues. While the bill has improved significantly, the Administration still has concerns with H.R. 1560's sweeping liability protections.  Appropriate liability protections should incentivize good cybersecurity practices and should not grant immunity to a private company for failing to act on information it receives about the security of its networks.  Such a provision would remove incentives for companies to protect their customers' personal information and may weaken cybersecurity writ large.  In addition, while H.R. 1560 would require that entities take reasonable measures to remove unnecessary personal information before sharing such information with others, the breadth of the liability protections could provide immunity to entities that are grossly negligent or even reckless.  The bill's language should also ensure that information is not shared for anticompetitive purposes.  The Administration believes that a reasonable solution that strikes an appropriate balance can be found.  Newly authorized cybersecurity information sharing should preserve the long-standing, respective roles and missions of civilian and intelligence agencies.  H.R. 1560 permits information sharing with the Federal Government through numerous Federal departments.  The Administration supports authorizing new liability-protected sharing relationships through the National Cybersecurity and Communication Integration Center, a civilian entity within the Department of Homeland Security.  This approach will help protect privacy, provide for  appropriate transparency, and be more effective operationally, enhancing the Federal Government's ability to quickly integrate, analyze, and use the information to protect the Nation's networks.  H.R. 1560 also authorizes the use of certain potentially disruptive defensive measures in response to network incidents, provisions that were not included in the Administration's proposal.  The use of defensive measures without appropriate safeguards raises significant legal, policy, and diplomatic concerns and can have a direct deleterious impact on information systems and undermine cybersecurity.  Moreover, as drafted, these provisions may prevent the application of other laws such as State common law tort remedies.  Though the Administration remains concerned that the bill\u2019s authorization to operate defensive measures is not adequately tailored, it is committed to working with stakeholders to address these concerns. H.R. 1560 recognizes that cybersecurity requires a whole-of-government approach and that information must be appropriately shared within the Federal Government.  This sharing must be governed by certain narrow use limitations \u2013 an essential part of overlapping privacy and civil liberties protections that also rely on transparent oversight.  The Administration commends the Committee for requiring that intra-governmental sharing be governed by a set of policies and procedures developed by the Federal Government to protect privacy and civil liberties.  The Administration seeks to work with Congress to ensure that other language in the bill regarding the ability to modify such information does not interfere with the Federal Government's ability to implement privacy protective policies and procedures.   Information sharing is one piece of a larger suite of legislation needed to provide the private sector, the Federal Government, and law enforcement with the necessary tools to combat cyber threats.  In addition to updating information sharing statutes, the Congress should incorporate privacy and civil liberties safeguards into all aspects of cybersecurity and enact legislation that creates a strong and consistent notification standard for breaches of personal data, as well as legislation that gives law enforcement the tools to fight cybercrime in the digital age.  * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that the regulatory process remains transparent and that agencies issue regulations, guidance, directives, and policy statements in compliance with all existing laws and Executive Orders.  H.R. 5226, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2016, would impose duplicative, vague, and unnecessary procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from efficiently performing their statutory responsibilities and potentially lead to a less informed public.  For these reasons, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5226.     The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2016 would be duplicative and costly to the American taxpayer.  The separate tracking and reporting of agency communications as prescribed by the bill is unnecessary, is extremely burdensome, and provides little to no value while diverting agency resources from important priorities.  In fact, much of the information it would require already is reported twice a year in the Unified Agenda, which is publicly available at www.reginfo.gov.  The manner by which agencies communicate to the public on regulations and their associated impacts already is covered by the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Information Quality Act, several long-standing Executive Orders, and agency-specific statutes.  Reporting each and every communication would dramatically increase the cost of regulation to the American taxpayer.  Passage of H.R. 5226 would undermine long-established regulatory frameworks by adding unhelpful, duplicative, and burdensome procedural requirements on agencies, while increasing the cost of regulation to the American taxpayer.

In contrast, H.R. 1335 would undermine the use of science-based actions to end and prevent overfishing.  The current requirements of MSA are working \u2013 the percentage of stocks that are subject to overfishing and the percentage that are in an overfished state are at historic lows.  H.R. 1335 would interfere with the tremendous success achieved in rebuilding overfished fisheries by setting rebuilding targets that are not based on sound, credible science, and that unnecessarily extend the time to rebuild fisheries.  In making these changes, H.R. 1335 introduces a series of ambiguous provisions that could improperly extend rebuilding periods, delaying the significant economic and environmental benefits of rebuilt fisheries to both fishermen and the Nation as a whole.    H.R. 1335 would exempt fishery management actions from the requirements for environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act and replace them with a new set of standards.  This provision is unnecessary, as the regional fishery management councils have integrated environmental analyses into an overall framework that is both timely and effective.   For similar reasons, the provisions regarding the Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, and the Antiquities Act are unnecessary and likely to give rise to confusion.  Rather than reducing burdens on the fishery management councils, these provisions of H.R. 1335 would interfere with a well-established and integrated system and would create confusion, delay, and the potential for litigation.  H.R. 1335 would also severely undermine the authority of the Gulf of Mexico Regional Fishery Management Council by extending State jurisdiction over the recreational red snapper fishery to nine miles in the Gulf of Mexico.  This proposed extension of jurisdiction would create an untenable situation where recreational and commercial fishermen fishing side-by-side would be subject to different regulatory regimes.  Absent an agreement among the States as to how to allocate recreationally-caught red snapper, the bill would encourage interstate conflict and jeopardize the sustainability of this Gulf-wide resource.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the Administration's efforts to fully utilize the flexibility in the current MSA.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a  proposed rule in January updating key guidelines for implementing the MSA, which would ameliorate many of the concerns that H.R. 1335 seeks to address without undermining the fundamental, science-based requirements of the MSA.  H.R. 1335 would introduce uncertainty and delays in rebuilding fisheries, undermine science-based management, weaken the protections provided by other important environmental statutes, and generate sector and interstate conflicts.    If the President were presented with H.R. 1335, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5278, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which would provide Puerto Rico with a comprehensive restructuring authority to address its unsustainable debt, coupled with appropriate fiscal oversight to increase transparency and achieve meaningful reforms.   Puerto Rico has already begun defaulting on its $70 billion of debt with a much larger default anticipated on July 1 when nearly $2 billion in additional payments are due.  However, this is not just a matter of financial liabilities.  The human costs for the 3.5 million Americans in Puerto Rico \u2013 in terms of access to health care, electricity, education, and basic public safety \u2013 are real and escalating daily.  H.R. 5278 would allow Puerto Rico to restructure its liabilities to help address the ongoing crisis, with no new Federal spending.    While the Administration supports passage of H.R. 5278, the Administration has concerns with some provisions in the bill.  The Administration opposes the measures in this bill on minimum wage and overtime that put in jeopardy important protections for workers, do nothing to address the crisis, and further exacerbate the economic disparities between Puerto Rico and the mainland United States.  Although the bill would include important provisions to ensure adequate funding for public sector pensions, it could do even more to protect pensions.  Further, the bill should ensure Puerto Ricans have a robust voice on the proposed Financial Oversight and Management Board.  While the bill includes provisions the Administration opposes, on balance, the Administration believes this compromise legislation is far superior to the status quo and is necessary to protect the well-being of 3.5 million Americans and create a path to recovery.   Only Congress has the authority to provide Puerto Rico the tools to resolve this crisis.  Failing to act now will result in an economic and humanitarian crisis far beyond what Puerto Rico is already facing today.  Absent the bill's protections and tools, an escalating series of lawsuits between creditors and against Puerto Rico could ensue, which could imperil essential services and put pensions in jeopardy.    The Administration urges the Congress to build on the bipartisan effort behind PROMESA and pass this legislation quickly before this crisis grows materially worse.    * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3762.  The House now has attempted to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times.  By repealing numerous key elements of current law, H.R. 3762 would take away critical benefits and health care coverage from hard-working middle-class families.  The bill also would remove policies that are expected to help slow the growth in health care costs and that have improved the quality of care patients receive.  H.R. 3762 would increase the deficit in the long term and detract from the work the Congress could be doing to foster job creation and economic growth.   The Affordable Care Act is working and is fully integrated into an improved American health care system.  Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is a thing of the past.  And under the Affordable Care Act, we've seen the slowest growth in health care prices in nearly 50 years, benefiting all Americans.   Repealing key elements of the Affordable Care Act would result in millions of individuals remaining uninsured or losing the insurance they have today.  An estimated 17.6 million Americans gained coverage as several of the Affordable Care Act's coverage provisions have taken effect \u2013 15.3 million since the beginning of the first open enrollment in October 2013.  This legislation would roll back coverage gains and would cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage they deserve.  Repealing the health care law would have implications far beyond these Americans who have or will gain insurance.  More than 150 million Americans with employer-based insurance would be at risk of higher premiums and lower wages, or losing their coverage altogether.  Reforms that strengthen Medicare's long-term finances also would be repealed, likely making Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund insolvent earlier.  H.R. 3762 also would defund the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which was created to help prevent disease, detect it early, and manage conditions before they become severe; limit women's health care choices; and disproportionately impact low-income individuals.  Rather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal basic protections that provide security for the middle class, Members of the Congress should be working together to grow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs.  If the President were presented with H.R. 3762, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3134 and H.R. 3504 because the bills, while different, would have the same consequence of limiting women\u2019s health care choices.    H.R. 3134 would defund Planned Parenthood based on its provision of abortion services.  Planned Parenthood uses both Federal and non-Federal funds to provide a range of important preventive care and health services, including health screenings, vaccinations, and check-ups to millions of men and women who visit their health centers annually. Longstanding Federal policy already prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  By eliminating Federal funding for a major provider of health care, H.R. 3134 would limit access to health care for men, women, and families across the Nation, and would disproportionately impact low-income individuals.    H.R. 3504 would impose new legal requirements related to the provision of abortion services in certain circumstances, which would likely have a chilling effect, reducing access to care.  If the President were presented with H.R. 3134 or H.R. 3504, he would veto them.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, and tailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 427, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015, which would impose an unprecedented requirement that a joint resolution of approval be enacted by the Congress before any major rule of an Executive Branch agency could have force or effect.  This radical departure from the longstanding separation of powers between the Executive and Legislative branches would delay and, in many cases, thwart implementation of statutory mandates and execution of duly-enacted laws, create business uncertainty, undermine much-needed protections of the American public, and cause unnecessary confusion.  There is no justification for such an unprecedented requirement.  When a Federal agency promulgates a major rule, it must already adhere to the particular requirements of the statute that it is implementing and to the constraints imposed by other Federal statutes and the Constitution. Indeed, in many cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the particular rule.  The agency must also comply with the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.).  When an agency issues a major rule, it must perform analyses of benefits and costs, analyses that are typically required by one or more statutes (such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act) as well as by Executive Orders 12866 and 13563.  In addition, this Administration has already taken numerous steps to reduce regulatory costs and to ensure that all major regulations are designed to maximize net benefits to society.  Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, public participation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a regulatory retrospective review.  In addition, Executive Order 13610 further institutionalizes retrospective review by requiring agencies to report regularly on the ways in which they are identifying and reducing the burden of existing regulations.  Finally, agency rules are subject to the jurisdiction of Federal courts.  Moreover, for the past 19 years, the Congress itself has had the opportunity, under the Congressional Review Act of 1996, to review on an individual basis the rules \u2013 both major and non-major \u2013 that Federal agencies have issued.  By replacing this well-established framework with a blanket requirement of Congressional approval, H.R. 427 would throw all major regulations into a months-long limbo, fostering uncertainty and impeding business investment that is vital to economic growth.  Maintaining an appropriate allocation of responsibility between the two branches is essential to ensuring that the  Nation's regulatory system effectively protects public health, welfare, safety, and our environment, while also promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.  If the President were presented with H.R. 427, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2029, making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. The bill fails to fully fund critical priorities, including veterans' medical care and military and VA construction.  Furthermore, the legislation includes a highly problematic ideological rider that would constrain the President's ability to protect our national security.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2029, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. Moreover, enacting H.R. 2029 while adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending limits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-class priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to threaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be motivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms. The Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both defense and non-defense for FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and thousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and grants, adversely impacting the pace of discovery and innovation, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.   Maintaining sequestration would also negatively impact programs that provide important services to our Nation's veterans and are funded in appropriations bills where House Republicans propose to make even deeper cuts relative to the President's Budget than in H.R. 2029.  For example, American Job Centers serve 1.2 million veterans annually, including 300,000 who receive intensive employment services.  Transition assistance provides 200,000 service members each year with employment guidance and information as they prepare to enter the civilian workforce.  And hundreds of thousands of veterans rely on a wide range of Department of Housing and Urban Development programs for housing support and homeless assistance each year.   Sequestration levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only through pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland Security, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of our  economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear that he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense without also fixing non-defense.    The President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2029 and any other legislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the investments we need for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense priorities and to offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both parties have urged.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Veterans Affairs Medical Care.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for our Nation's veterans; however, the Administration objects to the Committee's overall $585 million reduction to the FY 2016 Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Care request.  If enacted, this reduction would negatively impact medical care services for tens of thousands of veterans and reduce VA's ability to activate new and replacement facilities with sufficient staff and equipment and to adequately maintain facility infrastructure.    Veterans Affairs Construction.  The Administration objects to the Committee's $582 million reduction to the FY 2016 VA major construction request.  This reduction would prevent building upgrades and renovations, including necessary expansions to medical facilities and national cemeteries that would improve services to our veterans.  The bill would significantly constrain VA's ability to make progress on its highest priority capital projects.   Other Veterans Affairs Reductions.  The Administration also objects to the Committee's other reductions to the overall VA request, including $159 million in reductions for employee awards, bonuses, and the President's proposed 1.3 percent pay raise for Federal employees.  As VA attempts to enhance staffing to deliver better care to veterans, these reductions will hinder the Department's ability to recruit and retain personnel critical to the provision of benefits and services to veterans.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the proposed 1.3 percent pay increase for Federal civilian employees.   Military Construction.  The Administration objects to the Committee's underfunding of military construction in the President's FY 2016 base defense budget by $1.3 billion, which will delay or defer projects that serve critical needs for members of our Armed Forces and their families.  The projects requested in the FY 2016 Budget reflect the highest priority projects for the Department of Defense, and the Administration requests full funding for each project.    Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Funds.  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's use of $532 million of OCO funds intended for wars and not subject to the budget caps to pay for long-term infrastructure investments.  Shifting long-term defense costs to OCO is bad budget policy and bad defense policy, since it undermines long-term planning.  Moreover, the Administration has made clear that it will not accept attempts to fix defense without non-defense by using OCO as a mechanism to evade the defense budget cap.  2    Detainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to section 512 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This provision would constrain the flexibility that the Nation's Armed Forces and counterterrorism professionals need to best protect U.S. national security, intruding upon the Executive Branch's ability to carry out its mission.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  3   ", "The Administration strongly supports the bipartisan, bicameral efforts to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) embodied in the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 2576.  The bill is a clear improvement over the current TSCA and represents a historic advancement for both chemical safety and environmental law.   Consistent with the Administration's 2009 Principles for TSCA Reform, this bill would address flaws in current law that have limited the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ability to protect public health and the environment from chemical risks.  These important changes include:  (1) requiring EPA to evaluate new and existing chemicals against a new risk-based safety standard that includes explicit considerations for vulnerable populations; (2) empowering EPA to require the development of chemical information necessary to support these evaluations; (3) establishing clear and enforceable deadlines that ensure both timely review of prioritized chemicals and timely action on identified risks; (4) increasing the public transparency of chemical information by limiting unwarranted claims of confidentiality and allowing for the appropriate sharing of confidential information with States and health and environmental professionals; and (5) providing a source of funding for EPA to carry out these significant new responsibilities. While not perfect, the bill meets the high goals set by the Administration for meaningful reform and we commend the House and Senate for taking this historic step.  If the Federal government is to restore public confidence in the safety of chemicals, which are used in commerce and are an integral part of the Nation's economy, it is essential that the Congress provide EPA with the necessary tools and authorities to effectively assess chemicals and regulate risks.  This legislation provides a solid foundation for advancing these goals and improving public health and environmental protection.  The Administration encourages quick action on this landmark reform.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes the House Amendment to S. 304, the Conscience Protection Act of 2016, because it would have the consequence of limiting women's health care choices and because the Administration believes that protections in current Federal law already provide appropriate protection for the rights of conscience. Longstanding Federal policy already prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  Additionally, the Administration has instituted health care policies that appropriately accommodate religious objections.  This bill would unduly limit women's health care choices by allowing a broadly-defined set of health providers (including secular sponsors of employer-based health coverage) to decline to provide abortion coverage based on any objections.  The legislation would also permanently authorize alternative methods of enforcing these provisions that would inevitably lead to confusion.    The Administration is continuing its efforts to protect the rights of conscience, reduce unintended pregnancies, expand access to contraception, support maternal and child health, and minimize the need for abortion.  At the same time, the Administration is committed to the protection of women's health and reproductive freedom and to supporting women and families in the choices that they make, which\u2014as the Supreme Court just reaffirmed\u2014are protected by the Constitution.     If the President were presented with this legislation, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1105, which would add hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit to provide large tax cuts exclusively to the very wealthiest Americans.  Repealing the estate tax exclusively benefits just the wealthiest one or two estates out of every thousand\u2014which would receive a tax cut averaging more than $3 million each\u2014because current law already exempts more than $5 million of wealth for individuals and more than $10 million of wealth for couples from the tax.  Given these large exemptions, well over 99 percent of Americans, including virtually all small businesses and family farms, do not pay any estate tax.  H.R. 1105 would also shift a greater share of the tax burden onto working Americans at a time when the top one percent already holds more than 40 percent of the Nation's wealth and wealth disparities have risen to levels not seen since the 1930s. H.R. 1105 is fiscally irresponsible and, if enacted, would add $269 billion to the deficit over ten years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.  The bill would worsen the Nation's long-term fiscal challenges, jeopardizing programs and investments important to the middle class and national security.  In addition, H.R. 1105, which was reported by the House Ways and Means Committee on March 25, is inconsistent with the budget resolution passed by the House of Representatives that same day, which depends on current law estate tax revenues to meet its purported fiscal goals. H.R. 1105 is even more extreme than the temporary estate tax repeal enacted in 2001.  That legislation provided for a \"carryover basis\" regime to prevent large amounts of accumulated wealth from escaping both income and estate tax.  H.R. 1105 contains no such provision.  Instead, it leaves in place the largest capital gains loophole in the tax code by retaining \"stepped-up basis\" rules that exempt capital gains on assets held until death from income taxes.  The wealthiest Americans can often afford to hold onto assets until death, which lets them use the stepped-up basis loophole to avoid ever having to pay income tax on capital gains.  By retaining stepped-up basis even after repealing the estate tax, enactment of H.R. 1105 would not only add hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit to provide huge tax cuts to the most fortunate, it would endorse the principle that the wealthiest Americans should not have to pay tax on certain forms of income at all.  By contrast, the President's Budget would repeal the stepped-up basis loophole.  The Administration has consistently supported tax relief for middle-class and working families.  The President's FY 2016 Budget proposes tax credits that allow paychecks to go further in covering the cost of child care, college, and a secure retirement, and would create and expand tax credits that support and reward work.  In addition, it would invest in accelerating and sharing economic growth through education, research, infrastructure, and help for working families.  The President's proposals are fully paid for, primarily by closing tax loopholes for the highest-income  Americans.  The Administration wants to work with the Congress on fiscally responsible tax relief for middle-class and working Americans.  However, H.R. 1105 represents the wrong approach to the Nation's fiscal and economic challenges.  If the President were presented with H.R. 1105, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2822, making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The bill drastically underfunds core Department of the Interior programs as well as the Environmental Protection Agency's operating budget, which supports nationwide protection of human health and our vital air, water and land resources.  Funding levels in the bill would prevent investments that reduce future costs to taxpayers by facilitating increased energy development and maintaining facilities and infrastructure in national parks, refuges, forests, public lands, and Indian Country.  They would make it harder for States and businesses to plan and execute changes that would decrease carbon pollution and address the challenges the Nation faces from climate change.  They would also reduce support for partnerships and effective collaboration with States, local governments and private entities on  efforts to restore and conserve natural resources.  Further, the bill includes numerous highly problematic ideological provisions that have no place in funding legislation.  These provisions threaten to undermine the ability of States and communities to address climate change and protect a resource that is essential to America's health\u2014clean water, as well as the most basic protections for America's special places and the people and wildlife that rely on them.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2822, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.

The Administration disagrees strongly with the bill's reduction to EPA's operating budget by $474 million, or 13 percent, compared to the FY 2016 Budget request.  This reduced level of funding would significantly undermine implementation of the Clean Power Plan and the recently finalized Clean Water Rule.  The Clean Power Plan is a flexible and practical approach to addressing the risks of climate change by reducing carbon pollution from the electric power sector, the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States.  Climate change is not only an environmental challenge, it is also an economic, public health, and national security challenge.  Unabated climate change is projected to hamper economic growth in the United States and put the health and well-being of the Nation at risk from extreme weather events, wildland fire, poor air quality, and illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease carriers such as mosquitos and ticks.  Failing to address climate change would also exacerbate poverty and contribute to environmental degradation in developing countries, potentially resulting in resource shortages, political instability, and conflict.  Meanwhile, the bill also reduces funding to implement the recently finalized Clean Water Rule that would ensure waters protected under the Clean Water Act are more precisely defined and predictably determined.  By delaying implementation of this rule, business and industry face a more costly, difficult, and slower permitting process.  State Categorical Grants.  The Administration opposes the $118 million reduction to State and Tribal Categorical grants compared to the FY 2016 Budget request.  Often, States and Tribes implement environmental programs through delegated authorities.  However, the bill reduces these grants to States and Tribes to carry out activities such as water quality permitting, air monitoring, and hazardous waste management programs.  In addition, the bill reduces funding for brownfields projects by $35 million, or 32 percent, from the FY 2016 Budget request.  This reduced level of funding severely limits opportunities for local communities to revitalize their contaminated lands to improve environmental quality and spark economic redevelopment.  State Revolving Funds (SRFs).  The Administration objects to the funding levels provided for EPA's Clean Water and Drinking Water SRFs.  The bill reduces SRF funding by a combined $527 million from the FY 2016 Budget request, reducing necessary support to help communities finance water infrastructure improvements, resulting in approximately 200 fewer projects being funded nationally.  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Limits for Power Plants.  The Administration strongly objects to section 428 of the bill, which would prohibit the use of funds to propose, finalize, implement or enforce carbon pollution standards for fossil fuel-fired electric generating units that are the largest source 2  of carbon pollution in the United States.  The bill seeks to derail Administration efforts to address under section 111 of the Clean Air Act the urgent economic, public health, and national security impacts of unabated climate change.  Failure to reduce the utility sector's carbon footprint places the Nation at risk from extreme weather events, wildland fire, poor air quality, global instability, accelerated environmental degradation, and illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease carriers such as mosquitos and ticks.  Clean Water Act (CWA).  The Administration believes that the CWA provisions in the bill undermine efforts to protect America's clean water resources, which are critical to American families and businesses.  The Administration strongly objects to section 422 of the bill in particular, which would disrupt the Administration's current efforts to clarify the scope of CWA, hamstring future regulatory efforts, and create significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance.  Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).  The Administration regards the SCC as an essential component of the environmental rulemaking process and opposes the Congress' interference with the Interagency Working Group's (IWG) development of the SCC.  The Administration strongly objects to section 437 of the bill, which would force the IWG to revise the SCC using only the discount rates and \"domestic\" SCC values stated in Executive Order 12866 and Office of Management and Budget Circular A-4.  This revision would ignore the trans-boundary movement of carbon, fail to capture key costs of carbon emissions, and disrupt dozens of upcoming rules that would use the SCC to monetize carbon reduction benefits.  Limitations on Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program under the Clean Air Act (CAA).  The Administration objects to section 435 of the bill, which would block the finalization, implementation, and enforcement of a rule to prohibit certain uses of climate super-pollutants known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).  Domestic action to reduce use of HFCs is consistent with U.S. advocacy for addressing HFCs on a global basis, such as through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol.    National Ocean Policy.  The Administration objects to section 425 of the bill, which prohibits any funding provided in the bill from being used to implement the marine planning components of the National Ocean Policy.  This provision would prohibit the Department of the Interior (DOI) and EPA from participating in marine and coastal planning efforts, a process to better determine how the ocean, the Nation's coasts, and the Great Lakes are managed in an efficient manner.  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) Financial Assurance.  The Administration objects to section 427 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to develop, propose, finalize, and implement financial responsibility requirements under CERCLA 108(b).  On May 19, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered EPA to develop an expedited schedule for financial responsibility rules for the hardrock mining industry and for three other industries.  This provision would severely limit EPA's ability to develop these rules in a timely manner and abrogates EPA's responsibilities laid out in CERCLA 108(b).  Classification of Forest Biomass Fuels as Carbon-Neutral.  The Administration objects to the bill's representation of forest biomass as categorically \"carbon-neutral.\"  This language conflicts with existing EPA policies on biogenic CO  and interferes with the position of States that do not 23  apply the same policies to forest biomass as other renewable fuels like solar or wind.  This language stands in contradiction to a wide-ranging consensus on policies and best available science from EPA's own independent Science Advisory Board, numerous technical studies, many States, and various other stakeholders.  e-Manifest.  The Administration objects to the elimination of funding for e-Manifest development, EPA's system for electronically tracking the transport of hazardous waste.  While the Administration acknowledges the concern about the pace of development of the e-Manifest, eliminating the requested $7 million in funding at this time would jeopardize EPA's ongoing progress to develop the system and begin operations in the coming years.  Lead Test Kits.  The Administration objects to section 426 of the bill that would disrupt EPA's current activities under the 2008 Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting rule until EPA approves a commercially available \"improved\" lead paint test kit.  This provision would undermine EPA's efforts to protect sensitive populations from exposure to lead, a known toxin to children and developing fetuses, during home renovation projects.  Department of the Interior (DOI)   Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Topline.  The Administration opposes the $159 million, or  5 percent, reduction to BIA as compared to the FY 2016 Budget request.  This funding level would limit DOI's ability to make key investments in education and wrap-around services to support Native youth, eliminating all increases to post-secondary scholarships and $10 million for education program enhancement funds to allow Bureau of Indian Education to drive school improvement and reforms.  The bill reduces funding for initiatives aimed at supporting tribal self-determination through the creation of a one-stop portal to facilitate access to Federal resources and funding to address data gaps in Indian Country, and the creation of an Office of Indian Affairs Policy, Program Evaluation, and Data to support effective, data-driven, tribal policy making and program implementation.  In addition, this bill eliminates all increases to natural resources management on tribal lands, including funds to help tribal communities prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change.  National Park Service (NPS) Centennial.  The Administration opposes funding levels provided for the NPS Centennial.  The bill fails to provide adequate funding to prepare for the Centennial in 2016, resulting in the delay of roughly 70 percent of line-item park construction projects and 36 percent of repair and rehabilitation projects, and forgoes millions in matching private donations.  The bill also fails to provide funding for engaging youth and cultivating the next generation of conservation-minded individuals, including funding for transportation assistance to students from Title I schools.  Onshore Inspection Fees.  The bill does not include a proposal in the FY 2016 Budget request to institute a new onshore oil and gas inspection fee program.  The proposal, which is similar to the program already in place for offshore operations, would cover the cost of inspection activities and reduce the net cost to taxpayers of operating the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) oil and gas program.  Failure to adopt the new fees and associated funding would hamper the BLM's ability to protect human safety, conserve energy resources, facilitate the proper reporting of oil and gas production, and ensure environmental requirements are being followed in all phases of development.  4  State and Tribal Wildlife Grants.  The Administration opposes the 15 percent reduction to State and Tribal Wildlife Grants compared to the FY 2016 Budget request.  This important program allows States and Tribes, key partners in conservation, to strategically protect wildlife and conserve habitat in a way that complements Federal investments and yields better results for the public.  Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT).  The bill provides $452 million for PILT, which the Administration has proposed to fund through a separate mandatory appropriation in line with its previous congressional enactment.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for PILT, inclusion of these funds in the bill comes at the expense of all other programs funded by the bill.  Carcieri Land into Trust.  The bill fails to include the provision in the FY 2016 Budget request to clarify and reaffirm the Secretary of the Interior's authority to acquire land in trust under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA).  In Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 397 (2009), the Supreme Court held that the Secretary could acquire land in trust under the IRA only for tribes that were \"under Federal jurisdiction\" in 1934.  A legislative solution would help achieve the goals of the IRA and tribal self-determination by clarifying that DOI\u2019s authority under the law applies to all tribes, whether recognized in 1934 or after.  Such legislation would be consistent with the longstanding policy of assisting Tribes in establishing and protecting a land base sufficient to allow them to provide for the health, welfare, and safety of tribal members, and in treating all tribes equally for purposes of setting aside lands for tribal communities.   Hydraulic Fracturing:  Section 439 of the bill would block DOI from implementing, administering or enforcing the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s recently-finalized Hydraulic Fracturing rule.  This would leave the agency reliant on 30-year old requirements and prevent it from taking key steps to improve the safety of oil and gas drilling activities and improve opportunities for BLM to coordinate standards and processes with States and Tribes to reduce administrative costs and improve efficiency.  Stream Buffer Regulation.  Section 423 would prohibit DOI's Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement from updating 30-year-old stream protection regulations to reflect modern science and technology and better protect people and the environment, provide industry more certainty, and address recent court decisions.  Hunting, Fishing and Recreational Shooting.  Sections 421 and 424 would substantially impair the enforcement of a longstanding ban on the use of lead ammunition in the hunting of migratory waterfowl, and would complicate in other ways the overall implementation of hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on public lands.  Wildlife Trafficking.  Section 120 would interfere with ongoing Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) actions to combat wildlife trafficking, curb the poaching of African Elephants, and restrict trade in ivory, which would impair U.S. leadership in the global fight against ivory poaching.  Endangered Species Act Restrictions.  Sections 117, 121, and 122 of the bill undercut the Endangered Species Act by limiting the ability of the FWS to properly protect, based on the best available science, a number of species, including the greater sage grouse, northern long-eared bat, and certain gray wolf populations.  Language provisions, like those affecting the sage 5  grouse, would only create additional uncertainty and undermine unprecedented efforts to conserve the sagebrush landscape and the Western way of life.  Federal Acknowledgement of American Indian Tribes.  Language under the heading \"Bureau of Indian Affairs, Administrative Provisions\" in the bill would block DOI from finalizing, implementing, administering, or enforcing the Administration's proposed Federal acknowledgment rule, preventing DOI's effort to improve the regulations governing the process and criteria by which the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges an Indian Tribe.  DOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service  Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF).  The Administration objects to the drastic reduction of $152 million, or 38 percent, to the requested discretionary funding for DOI and USDA LWCF programs.  LWCF is a cornerstone of Federal conservation and recreation preservation efforts.  This funding level would severely impede agency capacity to further protect our Nation's natural heritage.  To date, the LWCF has contributed to the protection of key public lands, such as Rocky Mountain National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and portions of the Appalachian Trail, among others, as well as State and local recreation projects and important cultural heritage sites.  Wildland Fire Suppression.  The Administration's cap adjustment for wildfire suppression was not included in this bill.  Continued inaction on this proposal, which has bipartisan support, would increase the likelihood of disruptive funding transfers for suppression and away from the very restoration and fire risk reduction programs that are meant to restore landscapes and reduce suppression costs and restore landscapes.  Land Management Operations.  The Administration opposes the $502 million, or  8 percent, reduction to operational funding to land management agencies, relative to the FY 2016 Budget request.  This reduction would undermine support for the provision of basic public and business services that support the long-term health and resilience of national parks, forests, refuges, and other public lands.  Water Rights on Federal Land.  Section 434 prohibits agencies from conditioning land use authorizations on the transfer, relinquishment, or impairment of a water right, or on the acquisition of a water right in the name of the United States.  This language is unnecessary for its intended purpose, and would preclude land management agencies from protecting the public interest.  The provision would eliminate the ability of land management agencies to maintain sufficient water for other congressionally-designated purposes and ensure water rights are tied to the activities for which they were developed.  These restrictions would also hamper cooperative work with land users to improve land conditions, such as range improvements, or conduct habitat mitigation activities as part of land use agreements.  Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service  Land Management Improvements.  The bill provides $357 million for capital improvement and maintenance of the national forest system, a 5 percent increase from the FY 2016 Budget request.  While the Administration supports the capital improvement and maintenance of the Nation's public forests in order to increase its health, resilience, and accessibility, the increase in this bill comes at the expense of other needed priorities. 6   Department of Health and Human Services  Indian Health Service (IHS) Topline.  The Administration strongly opposes the reduction to funding for Native American health care programs and facilities of the Indian Health Service (IHS) by $300 million, or 6 percent, below the FY 2016 Budget request.  This would result in inadequate funding for the provision of health care to a population that is sicker and poorer compared to national averages.  For example, compared to the FY 2016 Budget request, the bill reduces funding by nearly $50 million for Purchased and Referred Care, a program that supports health care not available in IHS and tribal facilities, which would exacerbate existing levels of denied care and waiting lists for services.  Contract Support Costs.  The Administration objects to the limitation in funding for tribal Contract Support Costs (CSC) for BIA and IHS.  Specifically, the bill would limit funding for CSC that could perpetuate the funding issues described in the Supreme Court's Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter decision.  The Congress should pursue a long-term solution for CSC appropriations, providing an increase in funding in FY 2016 as part of a transition to a new three-year mandatory funding stream in FY 2017, as proposed in the President\u2019s Budget.  Other Provisions  Smithsonian Institution.  The bill reduces funding for the Smithsonian Institution by  $116 million, or 12 percent, below the FY 2016 Budget request\u2014a reduction that can be expected to reduce public access to the Smithsonian as well as increase safety concerns through delays in planned renovations.  With over 30 million visits to Smithsonian facilities recorded in 2014, it is important to ensure the museums, galleries, National Zoological Park, and nine research facilities that make up the world's largest museum and research complex remain open, maintained, and available to the generations of Americans who make use of this unique institution each year.  Specifically, the bill reductions would delay renovation for the National Air and Space Museum, where the museum has had to establish temporary covered walkways to protect the public from potential falling debris from its facade, and would reduce operating hours for the museums, including the new National Museum of African American History and Culture.    Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget requests for DOI and EPA to implement the DATA Act.  This funding would support efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and employing a uniform procurement instrument identifier.   U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget requests for DOI and EPA to develop U.S. Digital Service teams.  This funding would support managing the agency's digital services that have the greatest impact to citizens and businesses.   Constitutional Concerns  Several provisions in the bill raise separation of powers concerns.   7  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.    * * * * * * *  8  ", "The Administration strongly objects to H.R. 5351, which would prohibit the use of funds to transfer any individual detained at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, either to the United States or any foreign country.  As the Administration has said many times before, the continued operation of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  In February, the Administration submitted a comprehensive plan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter of our history to a close.  Rather than constructively engage with the Administration on the imperative of closing the facility, this bill would seek to prohibit any and all transfers of detainees, even where such transfers are conducted securely and responsibly and to further substantial U.S. national security interests.  This bill represents an effort not only to extend the facility's operation \u2013 as have the other unwarranted legislative restrictions on transfers \u2013 but to bring to a standstill the substantial progress the Administration has made in safely and securely reducing the facility's population.  As the Administration has repeatedly emphasized, detainees are transferred from Guantanamo Bay only after a rigorous interagency review process assesses, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, that potential receiving countries are capable of successfully reintegrating them and implementing appropriate security measures, consistent with our humane treatment policy.  The restrictions contained in this bill would seek to foreclose entirely the Executive Branch's ability to determine appropriate disposition options for detainees, including to transfer them consistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy, as well as its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Moreover, by purporting to prohibit all transfers of individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay, the bill would in some circumstances violate constitutional separation of powers principles, and could interfere with the ability to transfer a detainee who has been granted a writ of habeas corpus.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5351, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2028, making appropriations for energy and water development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The bill drastically underfunds critical investments that develop American energy sources to build a clean and secure energy future; develop and commercialize the emerging technologies that create high-quality jobs and enhance the Nation's economic competitiveness; and improve resilience against current and ongoing climate impacts that threaten our economy, public health, and natural resources.  As a result, it would put at risk U.S. competitiveness in new markets for clean energy industries such as advanced vehicles, advanced manufacturing, energy efficiency for homes and businesses, and domestic renewable energy such as wind, solar, and biomass.  It would also harm efforts to implement the President's nuclear strategy and advance counter-proliferation objectives.  Furthermore, the legislation includes highly problematic ideological riders, including provisions that threaten to undermine our ability to protect a resource that is essential to America's health:  clean water.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2028, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. In addition, enacting H.R. 2028, while adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending limits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-class priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to threaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be motivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both defense and non-defense for FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and thousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and grants, adversely impacting the pace of discovery and innovation, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.   Sequestration levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only through pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland Security, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of our economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear that he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense without also fixing non-defense.     The President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2028 and any other legislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the investments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense priorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both parties have urged.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Energy (DOE)  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Administration strongly objects to the $1.6 billion provided in the bill for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  Overall this level is $1.1 billion below the FY 2016 Budget request.  Relative to the FY 2016 Budget request, the bill reduces funding for renewable energy by 49 percent, sustainable transportation by 35 percent, and energy efficiency by 40 percent.  The proposed reductions significantly underfund critical activities that support the development and commercialization of clean energy technologies.  At this funding level, the number of research, development, and demonstration projects supported in cooperation with industry, universities, and the national labs would be reduced, limiting innovation and technological advancement, curtailing solutions to cut U.S. dependence on oil and reduce energy waste, and undermining the Nation's industrial competitiveness in the future global clean energy economy.  The Congress is urged to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request of $2.7 billion. The Administration is also disappointed that the bill does not include transfer language necessary to support joint efforts with the Navy and the Department of Agriculture to develop advanced drop-in biofuels for military applications, a provision included in the FY 2015 enacted bill.     Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration objects to the $280 million provided in the bill for ARPA-E, which is $45 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  This funding reduction would impact investments and delay improvements in technologies that reduce energy-related emissions, increase energy efficiency across multiple economic sectors, and reduce energy imports.    Fossil Energy and Nuclear Energy.  The Administration notes that the bill includes funding above the FY 2016 Budget request in some areas that are already well established in the market, including for nuclear and fossil energy, and yet makes drastic reductions in those that are most crucial to the Nation's clean energy future and continued U.S. technology leadership.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fund DOE's energy programs at the requested level, as this balances the portfolio among items of short, medium, and long-term progress and promotes U.S. leadership in these technology areas.    Office of Science.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Office of Science, the level of funding provided, which is $240 million below the FY 2016 Budget request, is insufficient to maintain U.S. leadership in high performance computing as the United 2   States moves into capable exascale systems to support discovery science, national security, and economic competitiveness.    Disposition of Weapons-Usable Plutonium.  The Administration objects to language in the bill that requires the Secretary of Energy to continue construction of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility.  This language is unnecessarily restrictive and would preclude alternative, and potentially more cost-effective, approaches to implementing U.S. commitments in the 2000 Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement and its 2010 annex to dispose of excess weapons plutonium.  DOE contracted for an independent validation of costs for plutonium disposition alternatives in accordance with congressional mandates.  The results of that analysis will inform the Administration's approach to plutonium disposition.  Information on the first phase of that analysis was provided to the Congress on April 21st.   Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).  The Administration opposes the $212 million level provided for SPR.  In addition to base program activities, the FY 2016 Budget request of $257 million includes resources to fund timely replacement of equipment and physical systems, to begin to address the backlog of deferred maintenance activities, and to enhance distribution flexibility and reliability.    Energy Information Administration (EIA).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request of $131 million for EIA to support expanded domestic energy data and analysis, address critical energy data gaps (including monthly movements of crude oil by rail), and increase integration of EIA energy data with Canada and Mexico.   Yucca Mountain.  The Administration objects to the funding provided in the bill for Yucca Mountain and is disappointed with the rejection of the practical solutions proposed in the President's nuclear waste strategy.  As reflected in the FY 2016 Budget request, this strategy incorporates important and workable elements, such as consent-based siting, interim storage of waste, and program funding reforms that are essential to the success of a Nuclear Waste Program.    Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Yucca Mountain.  The Administration objects to the funding provided in the bill for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue adjudication of the Yucca Mountain license application.    Office of the Federal Coordinator (OFC) for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects.  The Administration appreciates full funding for the OFC at the level of the FY 2016 Budget request, but is disappointed that the statutory amendment proposed in the FY 2016 Budget request is not included.  The amendment is critical to the OFC's ability to fulfill its mission under current market conditions, which have changed the nature of projects being proposed.   Corps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works (Corps)  Overall Funding.  The bill provides nearly $5.6 billion for the Corps civil works program.  The Administration believes the more appropriate overall funding levels proposed in the FY 2016 Budget request would limit wasteful spending on projects that provide a low or marginal return 3   to the Nation and would avoid reductions in other priority areas, such as protecting the Nation's water resources and important investments in clean energy technologies.    Corps Regulatory Program.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fund the Corps regulatory program at the requested level.  A $5 million reduction in funding would inhibit the Corps' ability to issue permits in a timely manner and to protect important aquatic resources, while undertaking needed programmatic improvements, including implementation of the pending Clean Water rulemaking.   Clean Water Act (CWA).  The Administration believes that the CWA riders in the bill undermine efforts to protect America's clean water resources, which are critical to American families and businesses.  The Administration strongly objects to section 105 of the bill in particular, which would disrupt the Administration's current efforts to clarify the scope of CWA, hamstring future regulatory efforts, and create significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance.    Firearms Policy.  The Administration objects to section 107 of the bill, which prohibits the Corps from enforcing its ban on firearms at a water resources development project.  If enacted, this provision would prevent the Secretary of the Army from using the discretion now provided in law to enforce or revise the current Corps policy, based on considerations such as the security of critical infrastructure, public and employee safety, and the manner in which the firearm is carried (e.g., open vs. concealed).  Corps rangers are not authorized to carry firearms and do not have full Federal law enforcement authority.     National Ocean Policy.  The Administration objects to section 505 of the bill, which prohibits any funding provided in the bill from being used to implement the marine planning components of the National Ocean Policy.  This rider would prohibit DOE and the Corps from participating in marine and coastal planning efforts, a process to better determine how the ocean, the Nation's coasts, and the Great Lakes are managed in an efficient manner.    Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project  Overall Funding.  The bill provides nearly $1.1 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and $9.9 million for the Central Utah Project.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Bureau of Reclamation water resources program.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * * 4   ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they are tailored to advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that they minimize uncertainty.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and well-understood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act, in a manner that ensures that the rulemaking process is transparent and considers the input of stakeholders.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations, consistent with their statutes, upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  The Administration continues to be guided by the same rigorous practices and principles used to develop and review regulations that have been upheld throughout the entirety of this Administration and previous Administrations.  On December 17, 2015, the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reiterated that the Administration would maintain its normal review standards, and instructed agencies to plan and prioritize its regulations in order to ensure an orderly review process during the final year of the Administration.  For these reasons, H.R. 5982 is intended to solve a problem that does not exist.   Lastly, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) already allows for the Congress to disapprove of rules on a case-by-case basis.  Thus, providing for an arbitrary packaging of rules for an up-or-down vote, as this bill does, is unnecessary.  In addition, the bill would expand the scope of rules subject to the CRA such that by the time a vote on a resolution occurs, some of the rules may have been in effect for over a year.  By doing so, H.R. 5982 would create tremendous regulatory uncertainty, potentially impose additional costs on businesses, and represent a step backwards for applying sound regulatory principles to protect public health, safety, the environment, and other critical aspects of society.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5982, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5631, H.R. 4992, and H.R. 5119, bills that would prevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  These bills would undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA commitments by reimposing certain secondary economic and financial sanctions lifted on \"Implementation Day\" of the JCPOA \u2013 the day on which the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verified Iran's completion of key nuclear-related steps. The JCPOA has significantly constrained Iran's nuclear program, including through the dismantlement of key aspects of the program, and subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements.  It is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States to continue to meet our commitments under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its commitments.    H.R. 5631 includes provisions that would prevent the Administration from implementing certain U.S. sanctions relief commitments under the JCPOA on the basis of non-nuclear related activity by Iran.  Specifically, the legislation would require the reimposition of sanctions on individuals and entities delisted on Implementation Day, as well as the re-imposition of financial and economic secondary sanctions lifted on Implementation Day, including sanctions on prominent Iranian economic sectors, such as the petrochemical sector.  In addition, this bill lacks flexibility including new waiver authorities as has typically been provided for new robust sanctions measures for continued use of sanctions in furtherance of our national security and foreign policy objectives.    H.R. 4992 contravenes United States commitments in the JCPOA, as it would reapply secondary sanctions on Iran's financial sector by prohibiting permissible financial transactions between Iran and the international community that are wholly outside the U.S. financial system.  This would amount to a harmful and unnecessary overreach, undermining the President's exercise of International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authority.  As the Administration has been clear, the United States will continue to impose our primary trade embargo on Iran, with certain limited exceptions set forth in the JCPOA, and take robust measures to protect the U.S. financial system from access by Iran.  However, this bill seeks to directly undermine Iran's conduct of banking transactions outside of the United States \u2013 activity that became permissible on Implementation Day in return for Iran meeting its nuclear-related commitments, as verified by the IAEA.    H.R. 5119 includes provisions that would foreclose the United States from procuring heavy water from Iran in the future.  Removal of excess heavy water from Iran denies Iran access to material that could be stockpiled for potential nuclear weapons production while also providing the international market access to an important commodity for research and non-nuclear industries.  As part of the JCPOA, Iran committed to a limit on the amount of heavy water that it could accumulate, but may sell its excess heavy water, further ensuring that Iran does not use this product to develop material for a nuclear weapon.  The United States does not produce heavy water.  For U.S. industry and research labs, heavy water is a critical material used for biomedical and diagnostic research \u2013 such as MRIs and pharmaceutical development \u2013 as well as for chemistry, physics and environmental analysis.  These bills, separately or collectively, thus would impact the continued viability of the JCPOA, a diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Dismantling the JCPOA would remove the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership and our commitments to our closest allies.   As we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed regarding Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region. The United States retains all of the tools it needs to counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to disrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and proliferation-sensitive technologies.  In addition, the United States remains committed to supporting our regional partners' enhancement of their defense capabilities and will continue our steadfast vigilance in enforcing multilateral export controls regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).    Continued implementation of JCPOA commitments by all participants \u2013 including the United States and our closest allies \u2013 is critical to ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States and the international community.   The President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA.  If the President were presented with H.R. 4992, H.R. 5119, or H.R. 5631, he would veto these bills.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s continued support of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in S. 1376, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, such as authorities that support capacity-building efforts with foreign military forces, enable the support of allies sharing common objectives, and  facilitate on-going operations.  While there are areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration strongly objects to provisions in the bill that would constrain the ability of the Department of Defense (DOD) to conduct multi-year defense planning and align military capabilities and force structure with the President\u2019s defense strategy.  First, the President has been very clear about the core principle that he will not support a budget that locks in sequestration, and he will not fix defense without fixing non-defense spending.  Sequestration levels will damage our ability to restore readiness, advance badly-needed technological modernization, and keep faith with our troops and their families.  Unfortunately, the bill fails to authorize sufficient funding for our military\u2019s priorities in the base budget, and instead uses Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in ways that leaders of both parties have made clear are inappropriate.  Shifting base budget resources into OCO risks undermining a mechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts and fails to provide a stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning is based.  The use of OCO funding to circumvent budget caps in defense spending also ignores the long-term connection between national security and economic security and fails to account for vital national security functions carried out at non-defense agencies.   Further, the bill fails to adopt many of the needed force structure and weapons system reforms included in the President\u2019s Budget, and fails to provide an authorization for a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round to allow DOD to properly align the military\u2019s infrastructure with the needs of its evolving force.  The President\u2019s defense strategy depends on investing every dollar where it will have the greatest effect, which the Administration\u2019s FY 2016 proposals will accomplish through critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, slow growth in compensation, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The Committee\u2019s changes would constrain the ability of DOD to align military capability and force structure with the President\u2019s defense strategy, and would require the Department to retain unnecessary force structure and weapons systems that cannot be adequately resourced in today's fiscal environment, contributing to a military that will be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.  The bill also continues unwarranted restrictions, and imposes onerous additional ones, regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay.  If this bill were presented to the President, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend to the President that he veto it.    The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks forward to working with Congress to address concerns on classified programs.   Sequestration and Misuse of OCO Funds:  The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s authorization of sequester level appropriations for items that were requested in and belong in the base budget and the use of OCO, a funding mechanism intended to pay for wars and not subject to the budget caps, to pay for $38 billion in base requirements.  Sequestration adds risk to our national security by threatening the size, readiness, presence, and capability of our military, and threatens the economic security on which our national security depends.  The Committee clearly recognizes that the President\u2019s Budget level for defense is needed, but authorizes it in a way that fails to acknowledge the need to reverse sequestration for both defense and non-defense spending.   Guantanamo Detainee Provisions:  The Administration strongly objects to provisions of the bill that would impede efforts to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  As the Administration has said many times before, operating this facility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.    While the Administration appreciates the additional flexibility provided by section 1034, which would permit the temporary transfer of detainees to the United States for certain medical care, other provisions of the bill are more restrictive than existing provisions to which the Administration has repeatedly objected.  Not only would provisions of the bill extend existing restrictions, they would impose additional unwise and unnecessary ones that would further impede efforts to responsibly close the facility.  While the bill would relax certain of these restrictions if Congress approves a plan to close the facility by joint resolution, this process for congressional approval is unnecessary and overly restrictive.  Sections 1031 and 1032 would prohibit the use of funds to construct or modify any facility in the United States to house detainees or to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States, except in the limited case of temporary medical transfers authorized by section 1034, until Congress approves a plan to close the facility.  Sections 1033 and 1035 would impose more onerous restrictions than current law does on transfers abroad and would prohibit certain categories of transfers entirely.  These provisions undermine our national security by limiting our ability to act as our military, diplomatic, and other national security professionals deem appropriate in a given case.  Under existing law, the Secretary of Defense is already required to make a determination that actions have been or will be taken to substantially mitigate risks to the United States or U.S. persons or interests posed by detainee transfers abroad.    The President has objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation.  The restrictions contained in this bill are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests, and when and where to transfer them consistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy.  Sections 1032, 1033, and 1035 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances, and section 1035 could in some circumstances interfere with a detainee\u2019s right to the writ of habeas corpus.    2  The Administration also strongly objects to the requirements in sections 1033(b)(2) and 1037, which would require the Secretary of Defense to provide Congress with diplomatic assurances regarding detainee transfers and reports containing such assurances.  Across two administrations, the Executive Branch has consistently informed Congress and represented before U.S. courts that disclosing such diplomatic assurances from foreign governments would have a chilling effect on those countries\u2019 willingness to cooperate on detainee transfers.    The Administration objects finally to the additional reporting requirement in section 1036, which would require the Secretary of Defense to submit an unclassified report to Congress on past detainee assessments produced by the Joint Task Force-Guantanamo.  The Administration does not believe this section, as drafted, is a productive measure and will treat this provision, along with sections 1033(b)(2) and 1037, consistent with the President\u2019s constitutional authority in this area.  Defense Acquisition:  The Administration strongly objects to section 843 and related provisions, which are inconsistent with the Secretary of Defense\u2019s exercise of authority, direction, and control over all of the DOD programs and activities.  Since DOD\u2019s founding, the Secretary of Defense has served as the principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to DOD and subordinated the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to the Secretary\u2019s authority.  This provision would undermine this principle by seeking to exclude the Secretary and his assistants from certain matters entrusted exclusively to the military departments.  Section 843 would significantly reduce the Secretary of Defense\u2019s ability - through the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics USD(AT&L) - to guard against unwarranted optimism in program planning and budget formulation, and prevent excessive risk taking during execution - all of which is essential to avoiding overruns and costly delays.  Program planning, management, and execution are already Service responsibilities.  The USD(AT&L) reviews Service plans at discrete milestones associated with major Department resource commitments to ensure programs are affordable, executable, and follow sound business and risk management practices.  The prohibition on documentation without a determination by the Deputy Chief Management Officer also abrogates the ability of the Secretary and Under Secretary to conduct routine execution monitoring of programs, thus handcuffing their ability to intercede unless and only until notified programs are at risk of failure.  Recent studies from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and DOD\u2019s own performance reports show clear empirical evidence of steady improvements in acquisition results since the role of the Under Secretary has been enhanced in recent years.  DOD is committed to reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and continuing the important work of improving the performance of its defense acquisition system in close coordination with Congress, including increasing the military Service Chief\u2019s role.  The Administration strongly objects to these provisions because they would not accomplish that goal, and would significantly increase the risk of overly optimistic program planning and budgeting.    Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) Recommendations:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for some of the MCRMC recommendations to improve our military compensation and retirement systems, and encourages Congress to support the additional recommendations for which the Administration has transmitted legislation.  The Administration continues to evaluate how the more complex recommendations of a Blended Retirement System would affect the All-Volunteer Force and expects to provide the Committee with further views on this proposal in the near future.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress and the MCRMC on other 3  provisions, to meet our solemn responsibility to ensure that any changes protect the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer Force, improve quality-of-life for service members and their families, and safeguard the fiscal sustainability of the military compensation and retirement systems.   Compensation Reform and TRICARE:  The President\u2019s Budget provides funding and common-sense reforms that will ensure that service members receive competitive pay and benefits and critical training and equipment.  The Administration believes it is imperative to slow the growth of personnel costs and modernize military healthcare and appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for several of these compensation reforms.  The Administration appreciates the modification of TRICARE pharmacy cost-sharing requirements in the bill.  However, among reforms not included in the bill are other proposed improvements that will modernize the TRICARE program.  TRICARE remains fundamentally unchanged since its inception in the mid-1990\u2019s and is antiquated by contemporary health plan standards.  The Consolidated Health Plan structure would provide DOD with substantial projected savings, simplify TRICARE for beneficiaries, and offer participants more freedom to choose providers.  Failing to enact the TRICARE and other various reform proposals would compel DOD to take additional reductions in the areas of readiness, modernization, and force structure.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress on these and other reforms to modernize and enhance the military health care system.   Commissary Streamlining and Privatization:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's efforts in adopting provisions that would strengthen the defense commissary system by treating commissary overseas transportations costs in the same manner as we do domestically and allowing the use of commissary surcharges to purchase operating supplies in lieu of appropriations.  Currently, the Administration has concerns with commissary privatization and the willingness of private sector entities to participate in such a project.  However, there is an independent study under way to determine whether privatization is a feasible option and we should wait for those results prior to making any policy changes.  In the meantime, the Administration encourages Congress to authorize the Department to pursue an alternative pilot program, as set forth in our current legislative proposal.  We also strongly encourage Congress to adopt the other elements of our proposal as the primary means to offset operating costs and develop effective commissary business practices without significantly affecting patron savings.   Prohibition on Conducting Additional BRAC Round:  The Administration strongly objects to section 2702, which does not authorize an additional BRAC round.  This impairs the ability of the Executive Branch to plan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration strongly urges Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which would allow DOD to right-size its infrastructure while providing important assistance to affected communities, freeing resources currently consumed by maintaining unneeded facilities.  In the absence of authorization of a new round of BRAC, the Administration will pursue alternative options to reduce this wasteful spending and ensure that DOD\u2019s limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security.   Prohibition on Retirement of A-10 Aircraft:  The Administration strongly objects to section 134, which is inconsistent with DOD\u2019s fiscal constraints and current priorities.  Section 134 would restrict DOD from obligating or expending funds to retire A-10 aircraft and would require a study by an independent agency focusing on what capabilities should be included in an A-10 4  replacement.  The retirement restriction puts at risk needed recapitalization efforts affecting the acquisition and manning of the Air Force fighter enterprise.  Additionally, the study specifies capability thresholds that may or may not be valid in future conflicts.  DOD believes the Joint Strike Fighter and other multi-mission aircraft will replace the A-10\u2019s singular mission of close air support while also providing other critical capabilities.   Limitations on Retirement, Management, or Acquisition of Aircraft:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 131-133 and 135-138, which are inconsistent with DOD\u2019s fiscal constraints and restrict DOD\u2019s ability to retire, acquire, or transfer weapon systems and aircraft platforms in accordance with current strategic and operational plans.  Air Force management of its operational assets across the force is critical.  These sections would limit acquisition, retirement or transfer of the following aircraft:  B-1, B-2, and B-52 bomber aircraft; all fighter aircraft; F-35A fighter,  EC-130 H Compass Call aircraft; C-130H aircraft and associated  manpower; T-1A Jayhawk aircraft; Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft; or Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar Systems (JSTARS) aircraft.  Such prohibitions limit or delay savings, efficiencies, and operational capabilities necessary to meet mission objectives in the current fiscal environment.   Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI):  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1044 and 1045, which would place new limitations on implementation of the ARI and negatively affect the Army\u2019s readiness and ability to prepare and deploy forces to meet ongoing operations.  The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2015 (FY 2015 NDAA) established limitations on the ARI, but provided for the transfer of certain numbers of aircraft and time for congressional review of the report of the Commission on the Future of the Army before transfer of additional aircraft.  The Department\u2019s plan for the transfer of select numbers of aircraft between the components in FY 2016 is in compliance with the FY 2015 NDAA and is the same as the number of Apache aircraft (72) that the National Guard Bureau agreed to transfer in their aviation proposal.  Sections 1044 and 1045 combined would have a negative impact on the combat effectiveness of three of eleven remaining Regular Army combat aviation brigades by preventing the transfer of Apache aircraft in FY 2016 to build the reconnaissance squadrons of the 1st Infantry Division in Kansas, the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, and the 10th Mountain Division in New York.  The remaining combat aviation brigades would bear the rotational burden to meet current and projected operational requirements around the world, and would increase operational tempo and deploy-to-dwell ratios for these low-density, high demand units.  These new limitations also would likely induce a 50-to-100 percent reduction of AH-64D inductions into the AH-64E remanufacturing facility in Mesa, Arizona and affect supporting activities in Huntsville, Alabama, and elsewhere.  The Administration urges Congress to remain consistent with the FY 2015 NDAA and permit the transfer of 72 Apache aircraft in FY 2016.   Streamlining DOD Management and Operational Headquarters:  While the Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s support for DOD\u2019s plan to reduce headquarters personnel and spending by 20 percent, the Administration strongly objects to section 351, which would require a reduction of 30 percent without recognizing reductions that have already been made.  By anchoring the reductions on the FY 2015 authorized amounts, the scale and timeline of these reductions would preclude DOD from implementing them through streamlining and process improvements.  Instead, DOD would be required to make deep, across-the-board cuts which would undermine critical functions that support the warfighter.  DOD\u2019s execution of then-Secretary of Defense Hagel\u2019s Department-wide 20 percent headquarters reduction plan projects savings of $5.3 billion.  These cuts were incorporated into the President\u2019s FY 2016 Budget and 5  will continue through FY 2019.  Section 351 anchors the cost reduction in DOD\u2019s administrative operations and maintenance account, which includes activities other than management headquarters; it is, therefore, an inappropriate basis for cost reduction.  Section 351 contains exemptions that would prevent enterprise-wide streamlining efforts, presupposes the priority of certain support functions with insufficient consideration of broader mission needs, and fails to recognize the important functional distinctions between the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Military Departments, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Combatant Commands that were established under the Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986.   Multiple Provisions Affecting Space Launch:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1603, 1604, 1605, and 1606, which contain provisions addressing contracting and development of launch capabilities.  Section 1603 would effectively eliminate the opportunity for meaningful competition during Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Phase 2 and leave restrictions in place that could inhibit DOD\u2019s ability to maintain assured access to space for National Security Space satellites.  Section 1604\u2019s restriction on the use of an EELV Launch Capability-like arrangement on future EELV competitions is premature because such an arrangement may be required to maintain two families of launch vehicles and support the Department\u2019s mandate of having assured access to space.  This restriction may also preclude DOD from meeting its commitments from the USG/Space X mediation.  In the event such an arrangement is determined to be in the Government\u2019s best interest, it would be applied fairly to all EELV launch service providers.  Section 1605 does not account for the 2-3 year lead time between the procurement and launch of the system.  Additionally, there is significant capability variation between single-core and three-core (heavy) launch vehicles.  Finally, the section 1606 requirement for a plan to develop and field a full-up rocket propulsion system would not, by itself, preserve the Nation\u2019s assured access to space.  Developing a rocket propulsion system independent of the rest of the space launch system risks the Government investing hundreds of millions of dollars without ensuring the availability of operational launch systems.  Sound systems engineering principles and over a half-century of launch vehicle design work demonstrate that a rocket propulsion system must be developed in conjunction with the rest of the space launch vehicle.  The Administration is committed to the same goals for space espoused in the bill -- assured access to space via commercially-viable, competitive, domestic launch providers using U.S.-developed launch systems for national security space.  Sections 1603-1606 would impede achievement of those goals.  Additionally, section 1605 would interfere with the President\u2019s constitutional authority to recommend to Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.   Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund (CTPF):  The Administration objects to the reduction of $1.1 billion of CTPF because it would severely limit a valuable partnership-focused approach to counterterrorism.  Reducing CTPF precludes DOD from continuing important security assistance programs begun in FY 2015.  The Administration strongly encourages Congress to authorize the $2.1 billion originally requested to continue support for CTPF activities in FY 2016.   Open Skies Treaty:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1662, which would change the reporting requirement to provide an assessment to Congress on the national security implications of Russian proposals to introduce new or modified sensors or aircraft, from 30 days to 90 days prior to the United States certifying the aircraft or sensors.  The 90-days requirement is not feasible, as it would allow insufficient time for the U.S. Government to assess the Russian proposal adequately and is only 30 days after we would be informed of Russia\u2019s notification of intent to certify, and before all analyses are completed.   6  Missile Defense Programs:  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of ballistic missile defense programs, the Administration objects to sections 1641, 1642, and 1643.  Section 1642 would require DOD to deploy a long-range discrimination sensor by December 30, 2020, to defend against potential future long-range ballistic missile threats from Iran.  DOD is conducting a comprehensive sensor analysis of alternatives, and mandating deployment of a missile tracking radar by 2020 is premature and unfunded.  Section 1643 would require a plan to deploy anti-air warfare capability to the Aegis Ashore sites in Poland and Romania.  If a U.S. solution were implemented, this requirement would entail hardware and software upgrades not previously planned and would introduce additional costs and potentially delay the deployment in Poland.  Installing this capability would also require amending previously negotiated agreements with the host nations as well as extensive discussions with our NATO Allies.  Section 1641 would require DOD to provide a plan to accelerate by two years the fielding of a potential future Continental United States interceptor site within 30 days of the completion of the ongoing Environmental Impact Statement.  Consistent with section 234 of the FY 2013 NDAA, DOD is already preparing a contingency plan and believes this added requirement is premature and inconsistent with best acquisition practices.   Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative:  The Administration strongly objects to the limitation in section 1251(c)(2), which stipulates that no more than 50 percent of the $300 million in authorized funds may be obligated until at least 20 percent is spent on lethal assistance or counter-battery radars.  This limitation forces the hand of the Administration in providing lethal assistance to the government of Ukraine - a decision that should rest with the Executive Branch.   Foreign Policy and Security Assistance-Related Authorities:  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s inclusion of several useful foreign policy and security assistance-related authorities.  Such authorities must strike the needed balance between specific defense initiatives and broader foreign policy priorities.  This delicate balance can be jeopardized by narrow new assistance authorities that address sensitive issues with profound foreign policy ramifications.   The Administration is currently conducting a review of existing authorities to determine if there are gaps that need to be addressed.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress on this effort and on ensuring that any legislation strikes the appropriate balance.  Restrictions Imposed on CVN 78 Class Aircraft Carrier Program:  The Administration strongly objects to section 111, which would reduce the cost limitation baseline for CVN 79 and subsequent FORD-class carriers to $11.398 billion.  A $100 million reduction would degrade the capabilities of CVN 79 and follow-on ships or increase the risk of a breach of the cap.  The current cost cap represents a significant reduction from CVN 78 and will be challenging to achieve.  Further reductions may impact the delivery of integral warfighting capability.  The Department has worked with the shipbuilder and other system providers to revamp the construction process for CVN 79 to avoid the cost increases experienced with construction of CVN 78.  The Administration also strongly objects to section 112, which would add debilitating restrictions to the construction and cost of CVN 79 by requiring Full Ship Shock Trials (FSST) on CVN 78 by September 30, 2017.  The three years of detailed planning and preparation activities required to complete FSST would divert engineering resources needed to complete the first-of-class integrated shipboard test program currently underway on CVN 78.  In addition, any further delays in delivering the ship would compromise deployed presence and contingency support, as well as surge capacity, to combatant commanders.   7  Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and Frigate (FF):  The Administration objects to limitations on Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy funding for LCS and FF ships.  Withholding 75 percent of the RDT&E Frigate funding would prevent the Navy from completing the necessary design and integration efforts required to develop technical data packages and proposal.  Withholding funding in support of the Frigate would jeopardize the Navy\u2019s ability to achieve a FY 2019 production contract, resulting in a gap in the production lines and additional procurement costs.  U.S. Southern Border Security:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1041 and 4401, related to the provision of assistance to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  Section 1041 would require the Secretary of Defense to provide assistance to the CBP efforts to secure the U.S. southern border.  This section would supplant existing laws, which authorize DOD support on a reimbursable basis, when necessary, and as determined by the President, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, with a law that mandates DOD support on a non-reimbursable basis, whether necessary or not.  This would leave the Secretary of Defense with no choice but to direct cuts in DOD programs intended to provide for the national defense of the United States - a DOD mission - in order to fund a DHS mission.  Likewise, section 4401 would add funds in Military Personnel Appropriations for additional National Guard support to CBP\u2019s Operation Phalanx.  The additional funding in section 4401 would change this National Guard support into a mission that benefits DHS at the expense of National Guard training requirements.  Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for Married Members and Members Living Together:  The Administration strongly objects to section 604, which would restrict BAH for uniformed service members who are married to another member and limit BAH for members who choose to share housing with other members.  BAH is a part of every member\u2019s regular military compensation and is designed to provide a cash housing allowance.  Section 604 would impose a significant marriage penalty when a member is married to another member.  This section would penalize members who choose to reside with other members as compared to those members who choose to reside alone or share housing with nonmembers.  This action would seem to conflict with the fundamental fiscal responsibility required of our service members.  Section 604 will have a disproportionate negative impact on women service members, where 20 percent of women on active duty are in a dual military marriage, compared with only 3.7 percent of active duty men.  These women will lose significant benefits and support they are owed for their service to our country.  Section 604 will degrade the culture and environment needed to keep our military open and welcoming to military families and risks sacrificing the strengths they bring to our nation\u2019s defense.  Finally, section 604 will have a negative impact on the recruitment and retention of the high quality service members, and families, required for our all-volunteer force.  Auditing of Contracts:  The Administration objects to section 878, which would preclude the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) from receiving reimbursements from non-Defense Agencies, unless the Secretary of Defense certifies that the DCAA-incurred cost backlog is less than 12 months of inventory.  This provision would cause additional burdens on the already overtaxed staff of the DOD Inspector General, DCAA auditors, and on industry, and would decrease efficiency within DCAA.  In the past three years DCAA has reduced the incurred cost backlog by 90 percent and those reductions are continuing.  The restrictions imposed by this section will not lead to the reductions envisioned and could result in unintended negative 8  consequences such as having to perform duplicative work and placing more burden on contractors having to deal with more than one audit group.  Unrequested Funding:  In this fiscally-constrained environment, the Administration objects to the authorization of billions of dollars of unnecessary funding offset by equal cuts to higher priority items requested in the President\u2019s Budget.  Unrequested items include $1.15 billion for extra F/A-18 aircraft and $1.1 billion for extra Joint Strike Fighters.  The Administration has made extensive efforts to assess, prioritize, and balance force capacity, capability, and readiness in developing the FY 2016 Budget.  Extra programs inserted in the budget come at the expense of programs that are more important and will create ripple effects across the rest of the budget.   Operation and Maintenance and Military Personnel Reductions:  The Administration objects to the billions of dollars of undistributed reductions in the bill across the operation and maintenance and military personnel accounts.  The operation and maintenance reductions would be applied to those programs which support readiness, depot maintenance, base operations support, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions will delay the Department\u2019s full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of maintenance  at the military departments\u2019 depot facilities.   No Entitlement to Unemployment Insurance While Receiving Post-9/11 Education Assistance:  The Administration objects to section 535 because the population of veterans it covers is too broad.  The intent of the MCRMC proposal was to eliminate the dual receipt of unemployment benefits and a housing stipend for veterans receiving Post-9/11 Education Assistance.  However, section 535 would affect every veteran receiving even a minimal amount of assistance through the Post 9/11 GI Bill, such as technology certification, credentialing, and licensing training.  State-level unemployment compensation programs already provide guidance regarding students\u2019 status within the workforce and eligibility to receive benefits.  This could have a disproportionate impact on Reserve Component service members because it could affect both separated and currently serving Reserve Component members.   Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton Raw Water Pipeline Military Construction Project:  The Administration strongly objects to the deletion of this essential project which supports the long-term sustainability of a critical training and deployment base by providing water security in a drought-stricken region.  The military construction project satisfies a court order to find a physical solution to an ongoing, more than 64-year dispute over water rights.  This project is DOD\u2019s contribution to the physical solution which, if not built in time, would allow the State to take Camp Pendleton\u2019s water rights back and force the Department of the Navy and the Fallbrook Public Utility District to reapply, thereby losing some of the most senior water rights on the river.  Without this project, Camp Pendleton would not be able to ensure the future supply of potable water that is required to train and deploy Marines of the I Marine Expeditionary Force.   Availability of Information - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP):  The Administration has a number of concerns with section 607, which would require the Secretary of Agriculture, in administering the supplemental nutrition assistance program, to \u201censure that any safeguards that prevent the use or disclosure of information obtained from applicant households shall not prevent the use of that information by, or the disclosure of that information to, the Secretary of Defense for purposes of determining the number of applicant households that contain one or more members of a regular component or reserve component of the Armed 9  Forces.\u201d  The Department of Agriculture would want to ensure that no provision compromises access to SNAP and confidentiality for military members in need who seek assistance, and is unclear on the implications of the provision as drafted.  Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) Contract Oversight:  The Administration objects to section 3115, to the extent that it would establish an owner's representative to carry out certain inherently governmental activities, such as the direct oversight of another contractor and the resolution of nuclear safety issues.  While the Department of Energy (DOE) supports utilizing an owner\u2019s representative to provide assistance to the Federal Project Director, section 3115 would interfere with the relationship between DOE and its representative by prescribing the representative\u2019s duties.  Section 3115 also inappropriately mandates completion of updated preliminary documented safety analyses before technical issues associated with the WTP are resolved and necessary design changes are identified.    Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD):  The Administration objects to Section 3117, which would increase the maximum amount that can be redirected from funded projects to the National Nuclear Security Administration LDRD from six percent to eight percent.  Both the Commission to Review the Effectiveness of the National Energy Laboratories and Secretary of Energy\u2019s Advisory Board are currently looking at the overall issue of LDRD and are going to be making recommendations on LDRD rates in the future.  Defense Meteorological Satellite Program:  The Administration objects to section 1607, which would limit the availability of all funding for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-20 and its launch until several onerous prerequisites are met.  By 2017, only one DMSP satellite will be within its design life.  Senior DOD officials have already certified that this fully-built and recently-refurbished satellite is a cost-effective solution to the expected shortfall in polar-orbiting weather satellites, which GAO has chronicled in its High Risk List.  Because weather satellite data are shared among defense, intelligence, civil, and international users, delays in launching this satellite would have broad implications, including reduced accuracy of weather prediction models and degraded efficiency of surveillance and reconnaissance platforms.  Launching DMSP-20 as soon as possible also minimizes the hefty maintenance cost of $70 million per year.  Section 1607 would unnecessarily delay the launch of this satellite, elevating risks to a variety of national missions and increasing costs to the taxpayer.   Constitutional Concerns:  A number of provisions raise additional constitutional concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these and other concerns. * * * * * * *    10  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, which would prevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) by tying the Administration's ability to fulfill U.S. commitments under the deal to unrelated, non-nuclear issues.  H.R. 3662 includes provisions that connect the United States' JCPOA commitment to provide sanctions relief by delisting certain Iran-related individuals and entities, including banks, to non-nuclear issues outside of the scope of the JCPOA.  In addition, certain provisions would effectively preclude delisting of individuals or entities on Implementation Day of the JCPOA \u2013 the day on which the International Atomic Energy Agency verifies that Iran has completed key nuclear-related steps that significantly dismantle and constrain its nuclear program \u2013 based on activity that may have taken place and ended long before Implementation Day and involving persons or activity that will no longer be sanctioned post-Implementation Day.  By preventing the United States from fulfilling its JCPOA commitments, H.R. 3662 could result in the collapse of a comprehensive diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  Such a collapse would remove the unprecedented constraints on Iran's nuclear program that we achieved in the JCPOA, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to America's credibility as a leader of international diplomacy.  This would have ripple effects, jeopardizing the hard work of sustaining a unified coalition to combat Iran's destabilizing activities in the region, calling into question the effectiveness of our sanctions regime and our ability to lead the world on nuclear non-proliferation.  The Administration has consistently made clear that the purpose of the nuclear negotiations, and ultimately the JCPOA, was to address one issue only \u2013 the international community's concerns over Iran's nuclear program and to verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  The JCPOA is the mechanism through which the United States was able to garner international support for our sanctions and achieve a diplomatic resolution.   As we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed and shares the deep concerns of the Congress and the American people about Iran's support for terrorism.  Powerful sanctions targeting Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile activities, its human rights abuses, and its destabilizing activities in the region remain in effect.  Anyone worldwide who transacts with or supports individuals or entities sanctioned in connection with Iran's support for terrorism or development of WMD and their means of delivery, including missiles \u2013 or who does the same with any Iranian individual or entity who remains on Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List \u2013 puts themselves at risk of being sanctioned.  The President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA.  If the President were presented with H.R. 3662, he would veto the bill.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 1206, the No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act; H.R. 4890, the IRS Bonuses Tied to Measurable Metrics Act; and H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2015.  These bills would impose unnecessary constraints on the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) operations without improving the agency's ability to administer the tax code and serve taxpayers.  H.R. 1206 would prohibit the IRS from hiring any new employees until the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that no IRS employee has a seriously delinquent debt, or provides a report to the Congress that includes an explanation of why certification is not possible and what would be required to provide such a certification. The bill could result in the IRS being prohibited from hiring any new employees for any purpose \u2013 a drastic and counterproductive step that would compromise tax administration and taxpayer services.  The bill is also unworkable in operation, as \"seriously delinquent\" debts could be as low as $1 and tax liens are recorded on a case-by-case basis.  This legislation is unnecessary, as strong laws and procedures already exist to ensure that IRS employees comply with their tax obligations.  Publicly-available data show that IRS employees are among the most tax compliant groups in the Nation with a delinquency rate of less than 1 percent.    H.R. 4890 would ban performance awards to IRS employees until the Secretary of the Treasury develops and implements a comprehensive customer service strategy.  This bill is unnecessary, as the IRS has already developed and has begun to execute a strategy to improve taxpayer services.  The real constraint on the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers effectively is severe underfunding, including for taxpayer services.  IRS funding is more than $900 million below its 2010 level, before adjusting for inflation.  These budget cuts have impeded the IRS's ability to serve taxpayers, including inadequate responses to taxpayer calls and correspondence.  Filing season statistics show that taxpayer service has improved this year as a result of a small funding increase provided last year, but more resources are needed to serve all taxpayers effectively and efficiently.  Legislation constraining the IRS's ability to retain and recruit highly qualified employees is not needed and could be counterproductive to the Service's mission.  H.R. 3724 would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any employee who was involuntarily separated due to misconduct.  The bill as written could force the immediate termination of employees who had been terminated and rehired many years ago, even if their performance since rehiring has been blemish-free.  The bill's prohibition is also unnecessary because current IRS processes  already ensure the agency does not rehire former employees who had significant conduct or performance problems during prior employment with the agency.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration is committed to helping entrepreneurs and small business owners access the capital they need to innovate, grow their enterprises, and create jobs.  H.R. 4498, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups (HALOS) Act, seeks to further these objectives by creating a new exemption to the prohibition of general solicitation for companies issuing private securities.  Specifically, the bill would require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revise Regulation D so that the prohibition against general solicitation does not apply to presentations or communications made at an event sponsored by certain organizations.    Although H.R. 4498 seeks to increase opportunities for companies to access investment capital, the Administration is concerned that the bill does not properly weigh the need for, and importance of, appropriate investor protections.  Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act requires that issuers selling securities in private markets through general solicitation take \"reasonable steps\" to verify that all purchasers are \"accredited investors.\"  This requirement helps ensure that unsophisticated investors do not make investments when they may not understand the attendant risks.  Creating a new exemption to this requirement may make it easier for companies to access necessary capital, but providing such an exemption comes at the cost of potentially increasing undue risk for certain investors.   Additionally, the SEC already has sought to alleviate some of the burden on startups and other small companies by exempting them from the \"reasonable steps\" requirement when the companies have a pre-existing, substantive relationship with the potential investors or have contacted the potential investors through a personal network before making a general solicitation.  The SEC determined that these relationships or communications were a sensible substitute for the \"reasonable steps\" otherwise required to assure that all purchasers were accredited investors, and did not unreasonably undermine investor protection.  The JOBS Act charged the SEC with implementing its titles through a robust rulemaking process, and the agency has done so by taking into account both the importance of access to capital for companies, as well as the importance of investor protection, both of which are essential for a well-functioning marketplace.  Any legislation that seeks to facilitate greater capital formation by clarifying or amending Federal securities law should similarly take both of these considerations into account.  We look forward to working with the Congress on this legislation as it moves forward.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports measures that enhance non-profits, philanthropic organizations, and faith-based and other charitable organizations in their many roles, including providing a safety net for those most in need, creating jobs that serve communities, encouraging environmental conservation and protection of land for current and future generations, and  incubating innovative solutions to some of the Nation's toughest challenges.  The President's Budget includes a number of proposals that would enhance and simplify charitable giving incentives for many individuals.  However, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 644, which would permanently extend three current provisions that offer enhanced tax breaks for certain donations and add another similar provision without offsetting the cost.  House Republicans are making clear their priorities by rushing to make these tax cuts permanent without offsets when key tax credit improvements benefiting 16 million working families with children are scheduled to expire.  They are also seeking to impose a double standard by adding to the deficit to continue and create tax breaks that primarily benefit higher-income individuals, after insisting on offsetting the cost of measures that help middle-class and working Americans, such as the extension of emergency unemployment benefits.  If this same, unprecedented approach of making certain traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits over the next ten years, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013. The Administration wants to work with the Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen America's charitable sector.  However, H.R. 644 represents the wrong approach. If the President were presented with H.R. 644, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 766.  This bill would constrain Federal banking regulators' ability to appropriately engage with the financial institutions they regulate for compliance with and enforcement of U.S. legal and regulatory requirements that are designed to protect the United States financial system from money laundering, terrorist financing, and other serious financial crimes.  Requiring Federal banking agencies to satisfy a written materiality requirement is unnecessary, overly burdensome, and could impede the Federal banking agencies' ability to ensure financial institutions comply with important regulatory obligations, including maintaining effective risk management and controls.  Restricting the Federal banking agencies in this way could unnecessarily and dangerously hinder or compromise important law enforcement and national security efforts.    A critical component of the Federal banking agencies' capacity to supervise banks for compliance with U.S. laws and regulations is their ability to ensure that financial institutions understand and appropriately account for their specific money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  To help institutions understand such risks, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Federal banking agencies periodically advise financial institutions of money laundering and terrorist financing threats and related vulnerabilities, risks, and suspicious activity.  Financial institutions may use this information to understand and manage their risks, including determining whether to terminate certain customer accounts if the institution determines that it is unable to manage such risks adequately after giving such risks due consideration.    H.R. 766 would add a series of impediments to financial fraud enforcement by limiting, in various ways, the Attorney General's authority to investigate and bring claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  The FIRREA statute serves as a powerful tool to address and deter frauds committed against American consumers and financial institutions.  The various hurdles imposed by H.R. 766 would only make such enforcement efforts more burdensome, time consuming, and rare \u2013 a series of effects that will allow fraud schemes to continue unaddressed for longer periods of time, to the detriment of the safety of consumers and the American financial system.  In addition, requiring Federal banking agencies to provide financial institutions with written justification disclosing information related to terrorist or other criminal activity may disclose sensitive information that could compromise important criminal and national security investigations and interests.  Such disclosures could lead financial institutions to take actions that will tip off suspects that they are under investigation, undermining national security.     Imposing burdensome and arbitrary standards hinder the ability of Federal financial regulators to protect the financial system and consumers from unnecessary risks.      If the President were presented with H.R. 766, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5063, the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act of 2016, because the legislation is unnecessary and would harm the public interest.  H.R. 5063 would prohibit the Federal Government from entering into settlement agreements that include payments directed to appropriate third parties.  This legislation seeks to address a problem that does not exist \u2013 the Federal Government does not create or use \"slush funds.\"  When the Federal Government settles a case with those who violate the law, it seeks to hold the defendants accountable and appropriately remedy the harms they have caused and to prevent the recurrence of those harms.    Because this legislation would interfere with the just and fair settlement of cases, if the President were presented with H.R. 5063, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that the regulatory process remains efficient and effective, and is tailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective manner.  H.R. 3438 would promote unwarranted litigation, introduce harmful delay, and, in many cases, thwart implementation of statutory mandates and execution of duly enacted laws.  The legislation also would increase business uncertainty and undermine much-needed protections for the American public, including critical rules that provide financial reform and protect public health, food safety, and the environment.  For these reasons, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3438.   The Unnecessary Delay of Rules Act would delay the implementation of \"high-impact\" rules until all legal challenges are fully exhausted or, if there is no legal challenge, until the end of a statutorily prescribed period.  H.R. 3438 would require this delay of all rules without consideration of the merits of the challenge or the consequences of delay.  These \"high-impact\" rules already must adhere to the particular requirements of the statute that the agency is implementing as well as the requirements of other Federal statutes and the Constitution.  Indeed, in many cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the particular rule.  The agency also must comply with the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.).  When issuing a major rule, an agency also must perform analyses of benefits and costs that typically are required by one or more statutes (such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act), as well as by Executive Order 12866.  Furthermore, courts already have the discretion to delay rules on a case-by-case basis.  Thus, the Unnecessary Delay of Rules Act is entirely unnecessary and would promote litigation designed only to delay rule implementation.   Given the extensive existing statutory framework already governing agency rules, the additional delays created by H.R. 3438 would needlessly endanger the welfare of the American public, while providing no benefit and creating a powerful incentive for litigation with little to no merit.    If the President were presented with H.R. 3438, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 6094, which would delay implementation of the Department of Labor's overtime rule until the middle of next year, endangering a critical step toward promoting higher pay and undermining efforts to allow workers to better balance their work and family obligations.  Since its creation, the 40-hour workweek has served as a cornerstone of the middle class.  Yet over the past several decades, overtime protections have eroded as a result of inflation and lobbyists' efforts to weaken them.  Today, only seven percent of full-time salaried workers qualify for overtime based on their pay, down sharply from 62 percent in 1975.  This means that more and more low- and middle-income workers are being forced to work extra hours without being paid for them.  Despite strong income growth in the last year, most American families have been squeezed by stagnant earnings during this period, and the lack of overtime protections only has put them at a further disadvantage.  The Department issued its new overtime regulation in May and the new rule is set to go into effect on December 1, 2016.  The final rule raises the salary threshold, from $23,660 to $47,476 a year, under which most salaried workers are guaranteed overtime.  In doing so, it will extend overtime protections to 4.2 million additional Americans who are not currently eligible for overtime under Federal law, boosting workers' wages by $12 billion over the next decade.  The rule also will automatically update the salary threshold every three years, to ensure that it does not erode again and to make it harder for employers to misclassify workers to avoid paying the overtime pay they have earned.    The final rule reflects input from hundreds of thousands of public comments and extensive stakeholder meetings with employers, business associations, small businesses, workers, advocates, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, and state and local governments.  The rule provides more than six months for employers to prepare for implementation, more time than was allowed when the rule was last updated with a comparable increase in the salary threshold.  Additionally, many employers, including nonprofits, institutions of higher education, and small businesses, are already taking steps to come into compliance.  This bill would be disruptive to their efforts and create new uncertainty for employers.  While this bill seeks to delay implementation, the real goal is clear\u2014delay and then deny overtime pay to workers.  With a strong economy and labor market, now is a good time for employers to provide these essential protections for workers, who cannot afford to wait.  If the President were presented with H.R. 6094, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1890, the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, and appreciates the bipartisan effort that led to the formulation of this bill.  Effective protection of trade secrets promotes innovation that is the engine of the Nation's economy and minimizes threats to American businesses, the U.S. economy, and national security interests.  S. 1890 would establish a Federal civil private cause of action for trade secret theft that would provide businesses with a more uniform, reliable, and predictable way to protect their valuable trade secrets anywhere in the country.  The Administration has placed high priority on mitigating and combating the theft of trade secrets, as exemplified in the Administration's Joint Strategic Plan on Intellectual Property Enforcement, the Administration's Strategy on Mitigating the Theft of U.S. Trade Secrets, and Executive Order 13694 authorizing sanctions on those who perpetrate cyber-enabled trade secret theft.  S. 1890 would provide important protection to the Nation's businesses and industries, including through the establishment of a Federal civil cause of action for trade secret misappropriation which would effectively build upon current Federal law and various State laws that have largely adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.  As such, the Administration strongly supports the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 and looks forward to working with the Congress on this important piece of legislation as it moves through the legislative process.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration continues to strongly oppose the private school vouchers program within this legislation, known as the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program.   Rigorous evaluation over several years demonstrates that D.C. vouchers have not yielded statistically significant improvements in student achievement by scholarship recipients compared to other students not receiving vouchers.  In addition, H.R. 10 would extend this voucher program to a new population of students previously attending private schools.  Instead of using Federal resources to support a handful of students in private schools, the Federal Government should focus its attention and available resources on improving the quality of public schools for all students.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 37.  The President has been clear about his opposition to legislation that would weaken and undermine the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  To that end, the Administration has significant concerns with provisions that would undermine the Volcker Rule by further delaying a part of its implementation to 2019.  The Volcker Rule is a key component of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act that prevents institutions from taking excessive risks through proprietary trading and fund investing, and taxpayers should not have to wait that long to have limits in place that protect them from risky practices.    The Administration also has concerns with other provisions that would roll back important derivatives reforms, as well as measures in the bill that would diminish protections for investors in public companies, including through reducing related reporting and disclosure requirements.  More generally, the Administration has strong concerns with any provision that would weaken key consumer and investor protections and elements of financial oversight.    The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is helping prevent the kinds of excessive financial risk taking that caused the worst recession in more than 70 years, left millions of Americans unemployed, and resulted in trillions of dollars in lost wealth.  These reforms help protect hard working families in everything from saving for retirement to the ability of small businesses to access credit through a stable financial system.  H.R. 37 unnecessarily puts these working and middle-class families at risk while benefitting Wall Street and other narrow special interests. If the President were presented with H.R. 37, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.    * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2685, making appropriations for the Department of Defense (DOD) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The Administration supports investments essential to execute the President's national security and defense strategies, and appreciates the Committee's recognition that the President's Budget level is needed for DOD, as well as its support of the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund, which is a vital partnership-focused approach to counterterrorism.  However, the bill drastically underfunds critical investments in DOD's base budget and instead uses Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in ways that leaders in both parties have made clear are inappropriate.  Base budget sequestration levels will damage our ability to restore readiness, advance badly-needed technological modernization, and keep faith with our troops and their families.  Meanwhile, shifting base budget resources into OCO risks undermining a mechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts and fails to provide a stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning and fiscal policy are based.  The use of OCO funding to circumvent budget caps in defense spending also ignores the long-term connection between national security and economic security and fails to account for vital national security functions carried out at non-defense agencies.    In addition, the bill fails to support many of the needed force structure and weapons system reforms included in the President's Budget, and undermines a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round that would allow DOD to properly align the military's infrastructure with the needs of its evolving force.  The President's defense strategy depends on investing every dollar where it will have the greatest effect, which the Administration's FY 2016 proposals will accomplish through critical reforms that divest unneeded force structure, slow growth in compensation, and reduce wasteful overhead.  The Committee's changes would constrain the ability of DOD to align military capability and force structure with the President's defense strategy, and would require the Department to retain unnecessary force structure and weapons systems that cannot be adequately resourced in today's fiscal environment, contributing to a military that will be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.  The bill also continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees at Guantanamo Bay.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2685, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   Enacting H.R. 2685 and adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending limits for FY 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-class priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to threaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be motivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense for  FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and thousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and grants, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.  Sequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only through pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland Security, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of our economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear that he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense without also fixing non-defense.  The President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2685 and any other legislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the investments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense priorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both parties have urged.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Defense  Sequestration and Misuse of OCO Funds.  The Administration strongly objects to the sequestration level appropriations in the bill for items that were requested in and belong in the base budget, as well as the use of OCO\u2014a funding mechanism intended to pay for wars and not subject to the budget caps\u2014to pay for $37.5 billion in base requirements.  Sequestration adds risk to our national security by threatening the size, readiness, presence, and capability of our military, and threatens the economic security on which our national security depends.  The Committee clearly recognizes that the President's Budget level for defense is needed, but proposes to fund it by circumventing instead of increasing the budget caps.  This approach fails to provide the stable, multi-year budget on which defense planning is based; undermines a mechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts; locks in unacceptable funding cuts for national security activities at non-defense agencies like the Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs; and also undermines national security by undermining the Nation's economic security.    Guantanamo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 8100, 8101, and 8102 of the bill, which would restrict the Executive Branch's ability to manage the detainee population at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility.  Sections 8100 and 8101 would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States.  Section 8102 would continue restrictions relating to transfers of detainees abroad.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions.  Operating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our 2  relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Sections 8100 and 8102 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles in certain circumstances.  Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC).  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress and MCRMC to improve our military compensation and retirement systems, and encourages the Congress to support the additional recommendations for which the Administration has transmitted legislation.  The Administration continues to evaluate how the more complex recommendations of a Blended Retirement System would affect the All-Volunteer Force, and expects to provide the Committee with further views on this proposal in the near future.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress and MCRMC on other provisions, to meet our solemn responsibility to ensure that any changes protect the long-term viability of the All-Volunteer Force, improve quality-of-life for service members and their families, and safeguard the fiscal sustainability of the military compensation and retirement systems.  Compensation Reform.  The FY 2016 Budget request provides the funding and common-sense reforms that will ensure that service members receive competitive pay and benefits and critical training and equipment.  The Administration believes it is imperative to slow the growth of basic pay and housing allowances, modernize military healthcare, and reform how commissaries operate, and strongly encourages members of the Congress to support these reforms, which would save $1.7 billion in FY 2016 and $18 billion through FY 2020.  Prohibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Round.  The Administration strongly objects to the proposed $10.5 million reduction to funds that would support a 2017 BRAC round.  This impairs the ability of the Executive Branch to plan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which would allow DOD to right-size its infrastructure while providing important assistance to affected communities, freeing resources currently consumed by maintaining unneeded facilities.  In the absence of authorization of a new round of BRAC, the Administration will pursue alternative options to reduce this wasteful spending and ensure that DOD's limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security.  A-10 Aircraft.  The Administration strongly objects to section 8120 of the bill, which is inconsistent with DOD's fiscal constraints and current priorities.  Section 8120 would restrict DOD from obligating or expending funds to retire A-10 aircraft.  This restriction would eliminate about $350 million in savings for FY 2016 and $4.7 billion in savings through FY 2019.  Further, it puts at risk needed recapitalization efforts adversely impacting the acquisition and manning of the Air Force fighter enterprise.  DOD needs to focus its resources on the Joint Strike Fighter and other multi-mission aircraft, which will replace the A-10's singular mission of close air support while also providing other critical capabilities.  Aviation Restructure Initiative (ARI).  The Administration strongly objects to section 8116 of the bill, which does not allow the transfer of any AH-64 Apache helicopters in FY 2016 and will negatively affect the Army's readiness and ability to prepare and deploy forces to meet ongoing 3  operations.  The FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) established limitations on the ARI, but provided for the transfer of certain numbers of aircraft in time for congressional review of the report of the Commission on the Future of the Army before transfer of additional aircraft.  Delaying the transfer until the passage of the FY 2016 NDAA will damage the readiness of Army units in the 1st Infantry Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in October 2015, the 25th Infantry Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in February 2016, and the 10th Mountain Division whose 24 AH-64s must transfer in June 2016.  The National Guard Bureau has concurred with the transfers and has plans in place with the States involved for the first 48 Apache aircraft.  DOD's plan for the transfer of select numbers of aircraft between the components in FY 2016 is in compliance with the FY 2015 NDAA and is the same as the number of Apache aircraft (72) that the National Guard Bureau agreed to transfer in its aviation proposal.  The Administration urges the Congress to remain consistent with the FY 2015 NDAA and permit the transfer of 72 Apache aircraft in FY 2016.  Missile Defense Programs.  The Administration strongly objects to funding reductions to several ballistic missile defense programs, specifically, the proposed reduction of $61.4 million to Improved Homeland Defense Interceptors (also known as the Redesigned Kill Vehicle program), which is needed to improve the reliability, producibility, and sustainability of the Ground-Based Interceptor.  This reduction will delay the program beyond the required 2020 timeline to protect the United States.  In addition, the Administration opposes the $25 million reduction to the Command, Control, Battle Management and Communications program and the $13 million reduction to the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor program.  Funding for both efforts is critical to meet the President's European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase III.  Finally, the Administration objects to the Committee-proposed reductions of $38.2 million to Technology Maturation Initiatives and $26.2 million to Special Programs.  These efforts are critical to ensuring the United States stays ahead of future ballistic missile threats.  Defense Meteorological Satellite Program.  The Administration strongly objects to the elimination of all funding for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)-20 and its launch.  By 2017, only one DMSP satellite will be within its design life.  DOD has certified that this fully-built and recently-refurbished satellite is a cost-effective solution to the expected shortfall in polar-orbiting weather satellites, which the Government Accountability Office has chronicled in its High Risk List.  Because weather satellite data are shared among defense, intelligence, civil, and international users, eliminating this satellite would have broad implications, including reduced accuracy of weather prediction models and degraded efficiency of surveillance and reconnaissance platforms.  Launching DMSP-20 also provides a competitive launch opportunity, which is a cornerstone of the Department's strategy to maintain assured access to space.  Funding Restriction on the Enforcement of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  The Administration strongly objects to the prohibition of funding for the enforcement of section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  This provision undercuts a law that provides an environmentally sound framework for the development of future alternative fuels, which contribute to a diverse, cost-competitive energy supply that enhances American energy security.  Unrequested Funding.  In this fiscally constrained environment, the Administration strongly objects to the billions of dollars provided for items that were not in the FY 2016 Budget request, offset by equal reductions to higher priority items that the military needs.  Unrequested items 4  include $1 billion for extra Joint Strike Fighters, $1 billion for additional F-18 aircraft, $1.1 billion to reverse planned savings associated with compensation reform proposals, $1.5 billion for National Guard and Reserve Equipment, $1 billion for additional Army vehicles and weapons systems, $635 million to fund an Afloat Forward Staging Base, and $65 million for an additional CV-22 Osprey aircraft.  The Administration has made extensive efforts to assess, prioritize, and balance force capacity, capability, and readiness in developing the FY 2016 Budget.  The Administration also objects to section 8006 of the bill, which places spending on unrequested items into statute.  DDG-51 Destroyers.  The Administration strongly objects to the reduction of $136.8 million in DDG-51 shipbuilding funds.  This reduction would make the DDG-51 program unexecutable, and preclude award of the second FY 2016 DDG as the initial Flight III ship.  This reduction would prevent the Navy from fielding the Flight III variant as planned, resulting in a delay of critically needed Integrated Air and Missile Defense capability to the Fleet.  Defense Health Program.  The Administration strongly objects to the bill's $1.4 billion reduction to the Defense Health Program within Operation and Maintenance.  Military medicine has had dramatic cost increases in FY 2015, and these costs are projected to continue to rise.  DOD has taken aggressive action to address increases in costs where possible and has strategies in place to continue these efforts.  However, we must ensure the health of the force and their families, along with upholding the promise to our retirees.  This will be increasingly difficult to achieve absent sufficient funding at the level established in the President's Budget request.  Without funding at the level requested, the Department will be forced to eliminate needed medical support programs and initiatives.  Aircraft Carrier Replacement Program.  The Administration objects to the bill's $74.7 million reduction to the Department of the Navy's Aircraft Carrier Replacement Program, ship construction account.  This funding reduction impacts five systems critical to the ship's required capability, presenting unacceptable risk to CVN 79 being delivered as a fully usable military warfighting asset.  The Department of the Navy, in conjunction with industry, has implemented oversight and funding proposals that will yield cost reductions in CVN 79 as compared to CVN 78.  Any further reduction would place additional risk to delivering integral warfighting systems and would likely inhibit the Aircraft Carrier Replacement Program's ability to meet the FY 2014 NDAA cost limitations for CVN 79 procurement.  Space Modernization Initiative (SMI).  The Administration objects to the $191 million reduction in SMI funding for the Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) System.  The Department's 2014 Space Strategic Portfolio review recommended significant changes to our space-based capabilities in the face of dramatically increasing threats.  The SMI is the critical resource to enable the evolution of the current SBIRS and AEHF systems to assured architectures, consistent with the DOD analyses.  Full funding of SMI allows the Department to dramatically reduce the technical, programmatic, and operational risks of these required architecture changes in advance of the major acquisition contract award, and assure that we will not suffer a capability gap in our most important mission areas.  Failing to invest in SMI technology maturation now will limit these systems to 1995 sensor technology and the associated obsolescence in our next satellite acquisition.  Limitation on Authorization for Certain FY 2016 Projects.  The Administration objects to section 8111 of the bill, which would limit expending funds associated with the construction of the Joint 5  Intelligence Analysis Complex Consolidation (JIAC), Phase 2, at Royal Air Force Croughton, United Kingdom, and would limit action to realign forces at Lajes Field, Azores, until the Department conveys specific information to the Committee.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this issue in order to avoid the potential for significant financial costs during a period of constrained resources, uncertainty among our allies that share equities in the JIAC, and disruption in intelligence support to the warfighter.  Operation and Maintenance, Procurement, and Military Personnel Reductions.  The Administration objects to the billions of dollars of undistributed reductions in the bill across the Operation and Maintenance, Procurement, and Military Personnel accounts.  The Operation and Maintenance reductions would be applied to specific programs, which include facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions will delay the Department's full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts.  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration appreciates the support the Committee provided for the DATA Act by fully funding the FY 2016 Budget request for the Department of Defense to implement the Act.   Classified Programs.  The Administration looks forward to providing its views on the adjustments contained in the Classified Annex to the bill once it becomes available.   Additional Constitutional Concerns.  Several other provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, section 8117 may interfere with the President's authority as Commander in Chief and section 8009 could interfere with the President's authority with regard to sensitive national security information.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  6  ", "The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s efforts to address energy needs in Indian Country.  Income from energy development is one of the larger sources of revenue generated from trust lands, and delays in development translate to delays in profits to Indian mineral rights owners.  The Administration has been taking meaningful action to update the leasing process for lands held in trust for Indian tribes, and is actively working to expedite appraisals, leasing, and permitting on Indian lands, and to provide resources to ensure safe and responsible development.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to develop the reforms necessary to support such development.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 6392, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2016.  Actions taken in the years since enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) are curbing excessive risk-taking, closing regulatory gaps, and making our financial system safer and more resilient, for both markets and consumers.  H.R. 6392 would severely weaken these reforms, put in place to discourage dozens of the Nation's largest banks from engaging in the risky behavior that precipitated the 2008 financial crisis.  We have made great progress as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, and we cannot afford to return to the days of deregulation and lax oversight.    The financial crisis revealed grave weaknesses in the Nation's financial regulatory framework.   By passing and signing the landmark reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Congress and the President, respectively, took significant steps to limit risks to financial stability and protect taxpayers from the consequences of such risks.  Because of the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulators have better tools to deal with financial shocks when they occur, and are able to protect Main Street and taxpayers from Wall Street's recklessness.  The law, among many other risk controls, provides the prudential regulators, and in particular the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the ability to apply enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets.  In conjunction, the law provides for a rigorous stress-testing regime, along with capital, liquidity and living will requirements, to better ensure that financial institutions are prepared for severe economic circumstances.  Only a financial system strong enough to withstand a major financial shock is capable of promoting sustainable economic growth.  Bank holding companies of all sizes were already subject to the Federal Reserve's supervision prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act.  In light of the greater risks posed by the Nation's largest banks as exhibited in the financial crisis, the Congress directed the Federal Reserve to simply apply stricter and escalating prudential standards to these few institutions with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets.  This crucial underpinning of Wall Street reform better positions our regulators to shed light on emerging threats and reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis.   H.R. 6392 would eliminate the $50 billion threshold, impairing the application of enhanced prudential standards to trillions of dollars of assets managed by dozens of the Nation's largest banks.  Under H.R. 6392, only eight U.S. global systemically important banks would be subject to enhanced prudential standards without further action by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  All other bank holding companies \u2013 including more than 20 large regional banks, each with more than $50 billion in assets and some that played a significant role in the financial crisis and received taxpayer support \u2013 would have to go through an extensive process  and be individually designated by the FSOC as a precondition for increased oversight.  While an extensive designation process is appropriate for nonbank financial companies that would be newly regulated by the Federal Reserve, such a process is inappropriate for bank holding companies already supervised by the Federal Reserve.  The new administrative burden imposed by H.R. 6392 would only distract the FSOC from focusing on its mission to proactively identify and protect against risks in the financial system before they wreak havoc on the Nation's economy.  Requirements that impede the ability of regulators to apply common-sense safeguards in a tiered and tailored manner to large financial institutions only expose taxpayers to the very risks that led to the financial crisis.     The President has been clear about his opposition to any legislation that would weaken or reduce oversight of the financial system.  H.R. 6392 would hamper oversight of dozens of the largest banks in the country and drastically roll back necessary provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, hamstringing regulators charged with monitoring and regulating the largest financial institutions and reverting to deficient, pre-crisis standards.  If the President were presented with H.R. 6392, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration is firmly committed to strengthening the Nation's financial system through the implementation of key reforms to safeguard derivatives markets and ensure a stronger and fairer financial system for investors and consumers.  The full benefit to the Nation's citizens and the economy cannot be realized unless the entities charged with establishing and enforcing the rules of the road have the resources to do so.   The Administration strongly opposes the passage of H.R. 2289 because it undermines the efficient functioning of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by imposing a number of organizational and procedural changes and would undercut efforts taken by the CFTC over the last year to address end-user concerns.  H.R. 2289 also offers no solution to address the persistent inadequacy of the agency's funding.  The CFTC is one of only two Federal financial regulators funded through annual discretionary appropriations, and the funding the Congress has provided for it over the past five years has failed to keep pace with the increasing complexity of the Nation's financial markets.  The changes proposed in H.R. 2289 would hinder the ability of the CFTC to operate effectively, thereby threatening the financial security of the middle class by encouraging the same kind of risky, irresponsible behavior that led to the great recession.   Prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the derivatives markets were largely unregulated. Losses connected to derivatives rippled through that hidden network, playing a central role in the financial crisis.  Wall Street Reform resulted in significant expansion of the CFTC's responsibilities, establishing a framework for standardized over-the-counter derivatives to be traded on regulated platforms and centrally cleared, and for data to be reported to repositories to increase transparency and price discovery.  The changes proposed in H.R. 2289 would hinder the CFTC's progress in successfully implementing these critical responsibilities and would unnecessarily disrupt the effective management and operation of the agency without providing the more robust and reliable funding that the agency needs.   In order to respond quickly to market events and market participants, the CFTC needs funding commensurate with its evolving oversight framework.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to authorize fee funding for the CFTC as proposed in the FY 2016 Budget request, a shift that would directly reduce the deficit.  User fees were first proposed in the President\u2019s Budget by the Reagan Administration more than 30 years ago and have been supported by every Democratic and Republican Administration since that time.  Fee funding would shift CFTC costs from the general taxpayer to the primary beneficiaries of the CFTC\u2019s oversight in a manner that maintains the efficiency, competitiveness, and financial integrity of the Nation\u2019s futures, options, and swaps markets, and supports market access for smaller market participants hedging or mitigating commercial or agricultural risk.   If the President were presented with H.R. 2289, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3716 because it improves program integrity for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).   H.R. 3716 would improve the ability of States to identify health care providers who have been terminated from participating in Medicare or in another State's Medicaid or CHIP program.  The Affordable Care Act requires that State Medicaid programs terminate participation of health care providers that have been terminated by Medicare or another State Medicaid program.  This legislation would improve States' ability to fulfill this requirement by codifying this requirement in CHIP, requiring providers participating in Medicaid and CHIP managed care to enroll with the State, and increasing required reporting, sharing of information, and standardization of documentation of reasons for termination.  Because the bill would reduce the likelihood that terminated providers could continue to participate in these programs, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that H.R. 3716 would reduce Federal spending by $28 million over 10 years.    * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes S. 1140, which would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army (Army) to withdraw and re-propose specified regulations needed to clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The agencies' rulemaking, grounded in science and the law, is essential to ensure clean water for future generations, and is responsive to calls for rulemaking from the Congress, industry, and community stakeholders as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.  The final rule has been through an extensive public engagement process.    Clean water is vital for the success of the Nation's businesses, agriculture, energy development, and the health of our communities.  More than one in three Americans get their drinking water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that are at risk of pollution from upstream sources.  The protection of wetlands is also vital for hunting and fishing.  When Congress passed the CWA in 1972 to restore the Nation's waters, it recognized that to have healthy communities downstream, we need to protect the smaller streams and wetlands upstream.     Clarifying the scope of the CWA helps to protect clean water, safeguard public health, and strengthen the economy.  Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 focused on specific jurisdictional determinations and rejected the analytical approach that the Army Corps of Engineers used for those determinations, but did not invalidate the underlying regulation.  This has created ongoing questions and uncertainty about how the regulation is applied consistent with the Court's decisions.  The final rule was developed to address this uncertainty.   If S. 1140 were enacted, any revisions to the CWA regulations would require the agencies to define waters of the United States in a manner inconsistent with the CWA as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, resulting in more confusion, uncertainty, and inconsistency.    S. 1140 would require the agencies to expend scarce resources to duplicate the transparent rulemaking process just completed, which involved extensive public outreach and participation, including over 400 public meetings, and 1 million public comments.  The agencies met with States, municipalities, small businesses, farmers, ranchers, miners, foresters, conservation groups, and many others to solicit input and reflect that input in a final rule.  A regulation as prescribed in S. 1140 would raise costs for landowners and businesses seeking a CWA permit and increase delays in the permit process.  S. 1140 also would reduce protection of the Nation's water quality and result in higher drinking water treatment costs, increased contamination of fish and shellfish, loss of recreational opportunities including hunting and fishing, and more frequent algal blooms that choke rivers and lakes and make waters unhealthy as a drinking water source or to swim and fish in.  Wetlands serve as a natural buffer to reduce flooding, and by ignoring this important role, S.1140 also would lead to more frequent and more damaging losses from  floods.  Families, communities, and businesses will have no choice but to pay for increased flood protection that natural wetlands currently provide for free.   If the President were presented with S. 1140, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of H.R. 1737 because it would revoke important guidance designed to prevent discriminatory pricing of auto loans.  H.R. 1737 would revoke guidance issued in 2013 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that helps ensure customers are not charged disproportionately higher prices for auto loans because of their race, color, religion or other characteristics that should have no bearing on loan decisions.  The bill also would require CFPB to undertake extensive study and consultation, as well as provide a notice and public comment period, before issuing any further auto loan guidance.  The bill would create confusion about the existing protections in place to prevent discriminatory auto loan pricing, and effectively block CFPB from issuing related guidance in the near-term.   The Administration is committed to ensuring that all Americans receive fair terms and pricing on auto loans, and are not discriminated against.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they are tailored to advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that they minimize uncertainty.  H.R. 527, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, would impose unneeded and costly analytical and procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from performing their statutory responsibilities.  It would also create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty and costs for businesses and the American public.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 527.  The bill would impose unnecessary new procedures on agencies and invite frivolous litigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and well understood procedural requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act and other Federal statutes such as the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act.   The Administration agrees that the Regulatory Flexibility Act establishes a national commitment to achieving statutory goals without imposing unnecessary burdens on the public, especially small business.  The Administration also recognizes the importance of considering alternate regulatory approaches that could minimize the significant economic impact of rules on small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions.  In addition, for decades agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  With respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act in particular, agencies already have in place procedures and policies, as required by Executive Orders 12866, 13272, 13563, and 13610 to ensure that agencies take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.   Furthermore, this Administration's deep commitment to promoting small business and ensuring that regulations do not unduly burden the Nation's small businesses is reflected in Executive Orders 13563 and 13610.  These Executive Orders require agencies to examine existing regulations and to eliminate, streamline, or alter them where they are excessively burdensome. In particular, Executive Order 13610 directs agencies to give special consideration to initiatives that would reduce unjustified regulatory burdens or simplify or harmonize regulatory requirements imposed on small businesses.  In response to these Executive Orders, twice a year agencies develop and publish their retrospective review plans for public comment.   Passage of H.R. 527 would burden the existing framework with layers of new procedural requirements that would seriously undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory  mandates.  It would expand the use of advocacy review panels, create needless grounds for judicial review and judicial remedies, and impose unrealistic analytic requirements on agencies.  In these ways and others, H.R. 527 would impede the ability of agencies to provide the public with basic protections, and create needless confusion and delay that would prove disruptive for businesses as well as for State, Tribal and local governments.If the President were presented with H.R. 527, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1270, which would create new and unnecessary tax breaks that disproportionately benefit high-income people, increase taxes for low- and middle-income people, and do nothing to improve the quality of or address the underlying cost of health care.   The Affordable Care Act is working and is fully integrated into an improved American health care system.  Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is a thing of the past.  Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 20 million more Americans have health insurance.  And under the Affordable Care Act, we have seen the slowest growth in health care prices in 50 years, benefiting all Americans.   H.R. 1270 would repeal the Affordable Care Act's provisions that limit the use of flexible savings accounts for over-the-counter drugs\u2014provisions that help fund the law's coverage improvements and expansions.  The bill also would provide additional tax breaks that disproportionately benefit those with higher income by expanding tax-preferred health savings accounts.  These changes would do little to reduce health care costs or improve quality.  To fund these new high-income tax breaks, H.R. 1270 would increase taxes paid by low- and middle-income families by removing the law's limit on repayment of premium tax credits available through the Health Insurance Marketplaces.    Rather than refighting old political battles by once again voting to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, Members of Congress should be working together to grow the economy, strengthen middle-class families, and create new jobs.  If the President were presented with H.R. 1270, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 36, which would unacceptably restrict women's health and reproductive rights and is an assault on a woman's right to choose.  Women should be able to make their own choices about their bodies and their health care, and Government should not inject itself into decisions best made between a woman and her doctor.  Over the past forty years, since Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court has affirmed a woman's constitutional right to privacy, including the right to choose.  H.R. 36 is a direct challenge to the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings on abortion.  Not only is the basis for H.R. 36 scientifically disputed, the bill disregards women's health and rights, the role doctors play in their patients' health care decisions, and the Constitution.  Furthermore, the provision that requires rape and incest survivors to report the crime to a law enforcement agency or child welfare authority in order to have access to an abortion after the 20-week mark demonstrates a complete disregard for the women who experience sexual assault and the barriers they may face in reporting.  Research indicates that the majority of survivors have not reported their sexual assaults to law enforcement.  The Administration is continuing its efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies, expand access to contraception, support maternal and child health, and minimize the need for abortion.  At the same time, the Administration is committed to the protection of women's health and reproductive freedom and to supporting women and families in the choices they make.

Most of the provisions included in this bill will strengthen the Administration\u2019s ability to both facilitate trade and improve enforcement of the rules. These new tools will strengthen the Administration\u2019s ability to level the playing field for U.S. workers, businesses and farmers.  The Administration strongly supports the enactment of these provisions.   The Administration strongly supports enactment of the provisions of Title III, Import-Related Protection of Intellectual Property Rights, within the bill.  These provisions will strengthen the authority and capacity of the Department of Homeland Security, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to combat the importation of infringing articles at the border.    The Administration appreciates the need for swift action in response to those who attempt to circumvent our trade laws.  But we have concerns with a specific provision that would grant the violator or alleger the ability to file a complaint in the Court of International Trade.  This would undermine enforcement of antidumping/countervailing duty (AD/CVD) laws, going against a core objective of the bill.  The Administration welcomes the opportunity to work with Congress on these proposals going forward.  The Administration welcomes new enforcement provisions contained in the legislation which will strengthen the Commerce Department\u2019s ability to address non-cooperative foreign companies and governments in trade remedy proceedings.  This provision and others contained in the legislation will enhance the Commerce Department\u2019s implementation of U.S. AD/CVD laws.    The Administration supports constructive tools to address unfair currency practices.  We support sections 711 and 712 of the bill, which target unfair currency practices and would establish objective standards and strong potential remedies that can further our goal of leveling the playing field for American workers and firms.  These provisions targeting currency practices in this manner would be the strongest in history if enacted.  But the Administration opposes the way the bill uses the countervailing duty process to address currency undervaluation.  Those provisions would undermine our international efforts to address this issue, raise highly problematic questions about consistency with our international obligations, lead to other countries pursuing retaliatory measures that could hurt our exporters, and be difficult to administer.   The Administration supports a more transparent process for considering duty suspensions, but  has concerns that trade policy considerations, such as the effect of duty suspensions on U.S. preference programs and current and future free trade agreement partners, have not been included in the bill.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these concerns and advancing the policies set forth in this bill.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3797, which would threaten the health of Americans by requiring changes to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for electric generating units (EGUs) that use coal refuse as their main fuel source.  Specifically, H.R. 3797 would restrict the market-based approach currently used to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances issued under the CSAPR, thereby raising the costs of achieving the pollution reduction required by the rule.  The bill also would undermine the emissions limits for hazardous acid gases from those established under the MATS, leading to increased health and environmental impacts from increased emissions of hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, other harmful acid gases, and sulfur dioxide.   CSAPR and MATS protect the health of millions of Americans by requiring the reduction of harmful power plant emissions, including air toxics and emissions that contribute to smog and fine particle pollution.  The pollution reductions from CSAPR and MATS will prevent thousands of premature deaths, asthma attacks, and heart attacks. An important feature of the CSAPR is its trading program which allows power plants to meet emission budgets in different ways, including by trading emissions allowances between emission sources within a State and some trading across States.  This market-based approach reduces the cost of compliance while ensuring reductions in air pollution for citizens across the CSAPR region.    H.R. 3797 would create an uneven playing field by picking winners and losers in CSAPR compliance.  The bill establishes a special market of CSAPR allowances for EGUs that burn coal refuse and prohibits the trading of allowances allocated to coal refuse EGUs, which would interfere with and manipulate market conditions.  By doing so, H.R. 3797 would:  (1) economically advantage coal refuse EGUs over other EGUs by giving them allowances that would otherwise have been allocated to others; (2) reduce compliance choices for other State units; and (3) distort the economic incentives of coal refuse EGUs to reduce emissions.  Further, the allowances allocated to coal refuse EGUs would be unavailable for use by any other sources, resulting, in the aggregate, in less efficient and more costly CSAPR compliance.  Additionally, H.R. 3797 would interfere with existing opportunities under the CSAPR for each State to control the allocation of allowances among its EGUs.   If the President were presented with H.R. 3797, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2578, making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The bill drastically underfunds critical investments in research and development that are key to advancing U.S. economic competitiveness and reducing taxpayer costs for securing essential weather satellite data and conducting an effective 2020 census.  It also severely underfunds State and local criminal justice assistance that helps ensure the safety and well-being of individuals and communities, and underfunds programs that would increase the use of body-worn cameras by law enforcement, expand training, provide much-needed police department reform, and multiply the number of cities where the Department of Justice facilitates community and local law enforcement engagement.  It also cuts support for NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program that will help end our reliance on Russia for transporting astronauts, critical space technology investments that will help pave the path to reaching Mars, and earth science research that is helping us understand how our climate is changing and how to respond to earthquakes, droughts, and severe weather events.  Furthermore, the legislation includes highly objectionable provisions, including provisions that continue unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees held at Guantanamo Bay that will undermine our national security, severely inhibit efforts to combat illegal gun trafficking, and put in place non-germane foreign policy restrictions related to Cuba.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2578, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  Enacting H.R. 2578 and adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending limits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-class priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to threaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be motivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both non-defense and defense for FY 2016 to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, more than two million fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and thousands fewer scientific and medical research awards and grants, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.    Sequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only through pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland Security, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of  our economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear that he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense without also fixing non-defense.    The President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2578 and any other legislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the investments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense priorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both parties have urged.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Department of Commerce  Census Bureau Periodic Censuses and Programs (including 2020 Decennial Census).  The Administration strongly objects to the inadequate funding provided to the Census Bureau to produce robust economic and demographic data and prepare for the 2020 Decennial Census.  The Committee's proposed funding level would increase taxpayers' cost of conducting the 2020 Decennial Census by billions of dollars by preventing the Census Bureau from developing, testing, and implementing critical cost saving innovations.  In addition, the reductions in funding for the American Community Survey threaten the data availability and coverage for rural communities and communities with small populations, depriving businesses and policy makers of the data necessary to make informed decisions.  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Labs.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund NIST research at the requested level given the important contributions that NIST makes to the U.S. economy.  Instead, the bill would eliminate funding for the lab-to-market initiative, constraining benefits to commercial entities and taxpayers from moving cutting-edge technologies out of Federal labs into the market.  It would also reduce NIST funding for research that can strengthen U.S. leadership in the industries of the future, such as cyber-physical systems and biomanufacturing.  Manufacturing Programs.  The Administration strongly objects to the lack of funding provided for manufacturing programs at NIST that would strengthen U.S. manufacturing at a time when an historic resurgence in U.S. manufacturing is taking hold.  In particular, the Committee provides none of the requested funds for the Department of Commerce to establish two manufacturing institutes as part of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation that are designed to bridge the gap between basic research and product development for technology areas.  These institutes encourage investment and production in the U.S. creating good jobs now and preparing American workers for future opportunities in the advanced manufacturing sector.  In addition, the funding level in the bill would not allow the Manufacturing Extension Partnership to provide its services to additional small and medium-sized manufacturers.  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Infrastructure.  The Administration objects to the bill's funding level for NOAA's Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction program, which precludes needed long-term infrastructure investments to collect critical environmental data.  While the bill includes the requested funding for the current generation of 2  critical weather satellites, it fails to provide the necessary resources to initiate the development of the next generation of polar-orbiting weather satellites.  The continuity of these satellites has been highlighted as a high risk by independent groups and the Government Accountability Office.  In addition to informing the day-to-day operations of businesses and individuals, weather data from NOAA satellites help predict the potential impact of extreme weather events, which lets communities and emergency responders prepare.  Not only would the bill heighten the risk of a gap in satellite coverage, but its shortsighted reductions mean that the next generation of polar-orbiting weather satellites would cost taxpayers more.  In addition, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the funding necessary to acquire a NOAA research vessel.  NOAA's aging research fleet plays a critical role in the research and management of marine resources, directly supporting coastal economies and environmental stewardship.  NOAA Operations.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the National Weather Service; however, the Administration opposes the funding levels provided for the National Ocean Service and climate research programs, which are 15 percent and 32 percent below the FY 2016 Budget request, respectively.  The reductions impact two high priority programs that help communities prepare for the effects of natural disasters and other ramifications of climate change and provide the science necessary to inform their preparations.  The Administration also urges the Congress to provide the requested funding to support infrastructure permitting consultations, which would reduce project timeframes and support economic development.  International Trade Administration.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $497 million, which would allow for the expansion of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center and SelectUSA.  These investments directly support businesses trying to compete in a global economy by ensuring a level playing field and helping secure new investments in local communities.  Economic Development Administration (EDA).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for EDA's Economic Development Assistance Programs.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the resources necessary for EDA to provide greater technical assistance to local communities and to make more effective use of a range of Federal economic development programs.  The FY 2016 Budget request for EDA furthers the agency's goal of creating new jobs by expanding EDA's capacity to help communities develop and implement comprehensive strategies for regional economic growth, work across silos of Federal, State, and other sources of assistance, and leverage scarce resources to maximize economic and community development opportunities.  U.S. Digital Service Team.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request of $6.4 million for the Department of Commerce to develop a U.S. Digital Service team.  This funding would support the Department's efforts to manage the agency's digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses, including increasing the availability of key data sets and improving the Department's interactions with the public.  Internet Governance Transition.  The Administration strongly objects to the provision that prevents the National Telecommunications and Information Administration from using funds to relinquish its responsibility with respect to internet domain name system functions, a commitment the U.S. Government made more than a decade ago.  The successful transition of these functions would facilitate a free and open internet managed through a multi-stakeholder 3  governance structure.  Department of Justice (DOJ)  Federal Law Enforcement.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for Federal law enforcement.  The bill provides $13.6 billion for the Department's law enforcement components and adequately funds key priorities including counterterrorism, counterintelligence, cybersecurity, and combatting illegal drugs and the trafficking of firearms.  The Administration also appreciates the investments in gun safety, including Now is the Time Comprehensive School Safety.  Community Policing Initiative.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for elements of the President's Community Policing Initiative, but strongly urges the Congress to fully fund the request.  As the Nation has observed in Baltimore and other communities, trust between law enforcement agencies and the people they protect and serve is essential.  However, compared to the FY 2016 Budget request, the bill substantially underfunds the body-worn camera program and related research, providing just $15 million of the requested $50 million for these purposes.  Without these critical investments, the bill fails to fully support law enforcement and improve relations between communities and police.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to fully fund this important initiative.  State and Local Grants.  The Administration strongly objects to the inadequate funding level provided for criminal justice assistance.  The bill provides $1.9 billion for State and local grants, which is approximately $500 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  The Administration strongly objects to the lack of funding for traditional COPS programs, including the COPS hiring program, which could result in an estimated 1,300 fewer officers and diminish the capacity of the Nation's first responders.  While the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program is formula-based, the COPS Hiring Program provides hiring and retention assistance directly to communities most in need.  In addition, the bill provides no specific funding for the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice Statistics; allocating funding out of the grant appropriations for these research and statistical programs would reduce grant programs by an additional $114 million from the FY 2016 Budget request.  The Administration is also concerned with the significant reduction to juvenile justice programs.  These programs help reduce juvenile delinquency and crime, protect public safety, hold offenders accountable, assist missing and exploited children and their families, and provide treatment and rehabilitative services tailored to the needs of juveniles and their families.  Legal Representation for Unaccompanied Children.  The Administration opposes the Committee's failure to provide for greater access to legal representation and services for unaccompanied children in our immigration court system.  We need every element of the court process to work effectively to accomplish the goal of both honoring humanitarian claims and processing those individuals who do not qualify for relief.  Although this bill supports some Administration immigration priorities, including the hiring of 55 additional Immigration Judge Teams, it fails to provide $50 million requested for legal representation for unaccompanied children in removal proceedings.  Without this funding, our efforts to process cases involving this vulnerable population will be less efficient and effective.  Violence Against Women.  The Administration appreciates the support for the Community Teams to Reduce the Sexual Assault Evidence Kit Backlog and Improve Sexual Assault Investigations 4  Program.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to provide adequate funding for the VAWA 20/20 Initiative and the Campus Program in order to address critical needs in the fight to stop violence against women, for the Tribal Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction Program to support grants to assist tribal governments in exercising special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction, and for research into reducing the backlog of sexual assault kits.  Investments in these programs would help to improve victim safety, save lives, and establish practices that can be sustained in the coming years.  General Legal Activities.  The Administration is concerned that the bill neglects to provide the requested increases for civil rights, environmental protection, healthcare fraud enforcement, human trafficking disruption, cybercrime prosecution, or international law enforcement training and justice development.  Given the recent events involving the mounting distrust between communities and law enforcement, the work of the Civil Rights Division in police reform is more important than ever.  The bill provides $885 million for General Legal Activities,  $152 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  This funding is insufficient to support the Administration priority to improve the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process, jeopardizing law enforcement access to information on international criminal and terrorist organizations.  Guantanamo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 527 and 528, which would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation and has called upon the Congress to lift the restrictions.  Operating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens U.S. national security by draining resources, damaging U.S. relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and U.S. national security interests.  Section 527 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances.  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF).  The Administration strongly objects to numerous provisions that would inhibit efforts to combat illegal gun activities, including unlawful trafficking, particularly where there has been little or no meaningful engagement with ATF on the provisions and their application.  The Administration also urges the Congress to repeal a number of other unnecessarily restrictive provisions made permanent in prior years.  Restrictions on Foreign Relations with Cuba.  The bill includes unrelated language regarding Cuban foreign policy, prohibiting funding to \"facilitate, permit, license, or promote exports to the Cuban military or intelligence service.\"  Executive Office of the President  U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $56.3 million for USTR.  The reduced funding level in the bill would limit USTR's ability to conduct major trade negotiations, enforce trade agreements, and pursue new and existing trade disputes.  5  Legal Services Corporation (LSC)  Legal Services Corporation.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's deep reductions to LSC, which would deny legal assistance to more than 350,000 low-income Americans\u2014including military families and veterans\u2014and undercut the fundamental American commitment to equal justice for all.  By reducing LSC's funding to the lowest level in 15 years, the bill would cause layoffs of more than 1,000 staff, including more than 430 attorneys at local programs, and the closure of 85 legal aid offices nationwide.  International Trade Commission (ITC).  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not fully fund ITC's lease expiration and housing plan.  The requested level provides necessary funds to reduce ITC's footprint, reduce operating and rent expenses, and achieve efficiencies in the long term.  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  Commercial Crew Program.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee underfunded NASA's Commercial Crew program by $243 million.  This would delay the date for launching U.S. astronauts to the space station with U.S. rockets and force a continued reliance on Russian capabilities, which currently require payments to Russia of approximately $500 million per year.  Space Technology.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request for NASA Space Technology.  Compared to the request, the bill reduces funding for these investments by $100 million, or 14 percent, delaying development of a cutting-edge laser communication system; advanced, high power solar electric propulsion; and other space technology demonstrations, slowing progress on the journey to Mars, and impacting the international competitiveness of the U.S. commercial space industry.  Earth Science Missions.  The Administration opposes the bill\u2019s reductions of Earth Science by more than $200 million, jeopardizing missions that are helping us respond to earthquakes, droughts, and severe weather events and understand how the climate is changing.  The bill also eliminates the launch of a key instrument used by western States to manage water supplies\u2014while at the same time adding $500 million above the requested level for the Space Launch System rocket.  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2016 Budget request for NASA and the National Science Foundation to implement the DATA Act.  This funding will support the agencies' efforts to provide more transparent Federal spending data, such as updating information technology systems, changing business processes, and employing a uniform procurement instrument identifier.   National Science Foundation (NSF)  Topline Funding.  The Administration strongly objects to the $7.4 billion funding level provided for NSF.  This level is $329 million below the FY 2016 Budget request.  The bill would lead to about 600 fewer research grants, affecting about 7,900 researchers, technicians, and students.  6  Especially hard hit by this reduction would be the geosciences and social, behavioral, and economic sciences, which would be reduced by 20 percent.  The Committee's allocation of resources to specific disciplines would interfere with NSF's ability to respond to scientific opportunity.   Constitutional Concerns  Several provisions in the bill, particularly sections 509, 519, 531, and 540, would raise constitutional concerns in certain applications by intruding upon the President's constitutional authority over international diplomacy.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these constitutional concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.   * * * * * * *    7  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5243, the Zika Response Appropriations Act of 2016.  The Zika virus poses a serious public health threat.  There is active, mosquito-borne transmission of the Zika virus in approximately 50 countries, including U.S. Territories.  The Zika virus is spreading in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and abroad, and there will likely be mosquito-borne transmission within the continental United States in the coming summer months.  As of May 11, 2016, there were more than 1,200 confirmed Zika cases in the continental United States and U.S. Territories, including over 110 pregnant women with confirmed cases of the Zika virus.  Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently concluded that the Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects.  In addition, researchers are investigating an association between the Zika virus and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, neurological disorders, and other adverse health outcomes.    The Administration is committed to taking necessary steps, as quickly as possible, to protect the American people from the Zika virus.  In February, the Administration submitted to the Congress a request for $1.9 billion in emergency supplemental funding.  In the absence of timely action from the Congress, the Administration redirected existing funds to scale up the urgent work necessary to address the Zika virus.  However, the redirected funds can only temporarily address what is needed to support the full range of activities aimed at preventing, detecting, and responding to further transmission of the Zika virus to protect the American public.    While the Administration appreciates that the Congress is finally taking action to address the Zika virus, the funding provided in H.R. 5243 is woefully inadequate to support the response our public health experts say is needed.  Specifically, the Administration's full request of $1.9 billion is needed to:  reduce the risk of the Zika virus, particularly in pregnant women, by better controlling the mosquitoes that spread Zika; develop new tools, including vaccines and better diagnostics to protect the Nation from the Zika virus; and conduct crucial research projects needed to better understand the impacts of the Zika virus on infants and children.     In addition, the Administration objects to the bill's use of previously-appropriated funding as an offset.  Funding to fight the Zika virus should be treated as an emergency, the same as past public health emergencies such as the Ebola and H1N1 viruses, and should not be offset.  Furthermore, rescinding additional funds previously designated for Ebola and other important initiatives such as critical infrastructure funding would harm the Nation's ability to address a range of urgent, emerging, and ongoing health challenges.  Ebola remains a global health threat, as evidenced by recent cases in Guinea and Liberia, and Ebola funds must be replenished to keep the disease from threatening our shores again.  The Administration also objects to the bill's limitation on funding only through the end of fiscal year 2016.  The CDC expects the health effects of the Zika virus to last beyond September 30, 2016, at which point the  Department of Health and Human Services would no longer have this funding for these activities and, given uncertainty around the disease, funding could run out even sooner.  Like prior emergencies, the effort to protect the American people from the Zika virus should not be funded incrementally.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide full emergency supplemental funding at the level requested by the President.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5243, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration supports enhancing, simplifying, and making permanent the Research and Experimentation Credit (\"R&D credit\"), and offsetting the cost by closing tax loopholes.  The President's Budget proposes to do so as part of pro-growth business tax reform that is revenue neutral over the long term.  Making the R&D credit permanent will increase its effectiveness, since it will allow businesses to make investments and create jobs today confident that they will continue to benefit from the credit in the future.  Moreover, four-fifths of the R&D credit is attributable to salaries of U.S. workers performing U.S.-based research\u2014meaning that the credit helps create high-skilled jobs, as well as encouraging new innovations and future productivity.  However, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 880, which would permanently extend and expand the R&D credit without offsetting the cost, adding to long-run deficits.  By making the R&D credit permanent without offsets, H.R. 880 would add $180 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years.  H.R. 880 violates the very standard that House and Senate Republicans approved less than a month ago in their concurrent budget resolution, which requires offsetting the cost of any tax extenders that are made permanent with other revenue measures.  If the House passes H.R. 880, it will have approved nearly $600 billion in deficit-increasing tax cuts mainly for corporations and wealthy estates this year \u2013 none of which are provided for in the Republicans' own budget.  As with other similar proposals, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the deficit to continue and expand costly tax breaks, while slashing investments and programs that serve middle class and working Americans in the name of fiscal rectitude.  If this same approach of making major tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.  House Republicans also are making clear their priorities by rushing to make business tax cuts permanent without offsets even as the Republican Budget Resolution calls for raising taxes on about 25 million working families and students by letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and education tax credits expire.  The Administration wants to work with the Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen the economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax reform.  However, H.R. 880 represents the wrong approach.  If the President were presented with H.R. 880, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *   2  ", " ", "The Administration appreciates the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence\u2019s continued support of the Intelligence Community (IC) and its efforts to ensure that the IC has the tools it needs to protect our national security.  The Administration supports a number of provisions in H.R. 2596, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, including the provision relating to business system transformation and other technical and conforming provisions.  However, while there are areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration strongly objects to several provisions of the bill.  If this bill were presented to the President, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend to the President that he veto it. The Administration looks forward to reviewing the classified schedule of authorizations once it becomes available and working with Congress to address classified authorization levels.  Nevertheless, the President has been very clear about the core principle that he will not support a budget that locks in sequestration, and he will not fix defense spending without fixing non-defense spending.  Sequestration levels add risk to our national security by damaging the IC\u2019s ability to provide strategic warning to decision-makers across all levels of government; to improve collection technologies to exploit existing and future opportunities and increase resilience; to provide cutting-edge technical analysis of counterintelligence, cyber, advanced weapons, and proliferation threats; to spur IC integration; and to increase intelligence capacity by investing in critical information technologies.  The Administration would strongly object to a bill that fails to authorize sufficient funding for the IC\u2019s priorities, and instead uses Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in ways that leaders of both parties have made clear are inappropriate.  Shifting base budget resources into OCO risks undermining a mechanism meant to fund incremental costs of overseas conflicts and fails to provide a stable, multi-year budget on which defense and intelligence planning is based. The use of OCO funding to circumvent budget caps in defense and intelligence spending also ignores the long-term connection between national security and economic security and fails to account for vital national security functions carried out at non-defense agencies.   Furthermore, the President\u2019s national intelligence strategy depends on investing every dollar where it will have the greatest effect.  The Administration would object should the classified schedule of authorizations continue to authorize funding of unrequested, multi-billion dollar acquisition programs that would provide little new capability at the expense of core mission areas that address validated intelligence requirements.  The FY 2016 Budget includes a prioritized and balanced investment plan, and these extra programs create ripple effects across the entire intelligence portfolio.   The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address the concerns outlined in more detail below.   Guantanamo Detainee Provisions:  The Administration strongly objects to several provisions of the bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  As the Administration has said many times before, operating this facility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  Rather than taking steps to bring this chapter of our history to a close, as the President has repeatedly called upon Congress to do, this bill aims to extend it.  Not only would it extend certain existing restrictions, it would impose an additional unwise and unnecessary restriction that would further impede efforts to responsibly close the facility.  Sections 321 and 322 would prohibit the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States or to construct or modify any facility in the United States to house detainees.  Section 323 would seek to prohibit certain foreign transfers entirely.  The Administration has objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation.  These restrictions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute them, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests, and when and where to transfer them consistent with our national security and our humane treatment policy.  Sections 321 and 323 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances, and section 323 could in some circumstances interfere with a detainee\u2019s right to the writ of habeas corpus.  In addition, sections 331 and 333 would require burdensome and unnecessary reporting to Congress and could interfere with the President\u2019s authority to protect sensitive national security information. Prohibition on Sharing of Certain Information in Response to Foreign Government Inquiries:  The Administration strongly objects to section 308, which prohibits the IC from responding to, sharing, or authorizing the sharing of any non-public information related to an intelligence activity carried out by the United States in response to a legislative or judicial inquiry from a foreign government into the intelligence activities of the United States.  This provision could affect our relationships with foreign partners and interferes with the President\u2019s authority to conduct foreign relations and control the dissemination of sensitive national security information.     Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC):  The Administration is committed to establishing the CTIIC as a robust element of the government\u2019s cyber capabilities, but objects to the language in this bill concerning the CTIIC\u2019s role and responsibilities.  The Administration intends for the CTIIC to be a national intelligence center focused on \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d regarding malicious foreign cyber threats to the nation and cyber incidents affecting U.S. national interests, and on providing reliable all-source analysis to U.S. policy makers.  This bill seeks to significantly expand CTIIC\u2019s roles and responsibilities beyond those contained in the President\u2019s February 25 memorandum directing the establishment of the CTIIC.  Further, the bill gives the CTIIC certain intelligence mission management functions already assigned elsewhere in the IC.  Given the rapidly changing nature of cyber threats to the United States, the CTIIC will require flexibility in executing its core functions.  Furthermore, the limits this bill would place on CTIIC\u2019s resources, and the expansive approach the bill would take with regard to CTIIC\u2019s missions, are unnecessary and unwise, and would risk the CTIIC being unable to fully perform the core functions assigned to it in the bill.  Instead, the Administration believes that 2  responsibilities given to the CTIIC in the President\u2019s February 25 memorandum are appropriate given the need for the CTIIC to be a tailored, nimble organization that supports and enables the Federal government\u2019s efforts to identify, defend against, and respond to cyber threats.   Reporting Requirements:  The Administration also objects to certain reporting requirements in the bill.  For instance, section 303 would prohibit the use of funds to initiate any new special access program unless the Director of National Intelligence or the Secretary of Defense submits a notification to the congressional committees 30 days before initiating such program, subject to a limited exception.  Such a requirement is unduly burdensome and does not offer the IC sufficient flexibility to efficiently manage special access programs while meeting the oversight needs of the Congress.  The Administration also objects to section 332, which requires a report to Congress every 60 days for the next three years on foreign fighter flows to and from Syria.  These provisions are unnecessary and overly burdensome and could, in certain circumstances, interfere with the President\u2019s authority with regard to sensitive national security information.  The Administration stands ready to work with Congress on possible alternatives.  The Administration is committed to ensuring that the relevant committees have the information they need for effective oversight of the IC and looks forward to working with Congress to address our concerns with these provisions.   * * * * * * *  3  ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 2017, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2015.  The Administration is committed to promoting the public health and ensuring that Americans have access to information to make informed food choices for themselves and their families.  Today, Americans eat and drink about one-third of their calories away from home.    To provide consumers with calorie and other nutrition information about the foods they eat outside of their homes, the Congress in 2010 required that calorie information be listed on menus and menu boards in certain chain restaurants and similar retail food establishments with 20 or more locations, and on certain vending machines.  In 2014, after extensive shareholder and public participation, the Food and Drug Administration finalized rules implementing the statutory menu labeling and vending machine labeling requirements.   H.R. 2017 would undercut the objective of providing clear, consistent calorie information to consumers.  If enacted, it would reduce consumers' access to nutrition information and likely create consumer confusion by introducing a great deal of variability into how calories are declared.  The legislation also would create unnecessary delays in the implementation of menu labeling.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2898, the Western Water and American Food Security Act of 2015, because it fails to address critical elements of California's complex water challenges and will, if enacted, impede an effective and timely response to the continuing drought while providing no additional water to hard hit communities.  Like similar legislation in the last Congress, H.R. 2898 was developed with little input from the public, the Administration, or key stakeholders affected by the drought.  The urgency and seriousness of the California drought requires a balanced and flexible approach that promotes water reliability and ecosystem restoration.  Specifically, H.R. 2898 dictates operational decisions and imposes a new legal standard which could actually limit water supplies by creating new and confusing conflicts with existing laws, adding an unnecessary layer of complexity to Federal and State cooperation.  This additional standard could slow decision-making, generate significantlitigation, and limit real-time  operational flexibility critical to maximizing water delivery.  And, contrary to current and past Federal reclamation law that defers to State water law, the bill would preempt California water law.   In addition, H.R. 2898 directs specific operations inconsistent with the Endangered Species Act (ESA), thereby resulting in conditions that could be detrimental to the Delta fish and other species listed under Federal and State endangered species laws.  The Administration strongly supports efforts to help alleviate the effects of drought in the West; however, the Administration is concerned with section 401, which establishes deadlines for completing feasibility studies for certain water storage projects.  The provision is unnecessary and the dates provided in the bill could prevent the participation of non-Federal partners in certain studies and may inhibit the Administration's ability to consider a full range of options for addressing these issues.  In addition, financial penalties levied upon the Bureau of Reclamation under section 403 for not meeting these deadlines would only undermine the Department of the Interior's ability to help address the effects of drought in the West.  Much of the bill contains provisions that have little connection to the ongoing drought.  The bill includes language constraining the Administration's ability to protect the commercial and tribal fishery on the Trinity and Klamath Rivers, which will have impacts not just in California, but throughout the west coast.  The bill would also repeal the San Joaquin River Settlement Agreement, which the Congress enacted to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation.  Full repeal of the settlement agreement would likely result in the resumption of costly litigation, creating an  uncertain future for river restoration and water delivery operations for water users on the San Joaquin River.  Californians are facing significant drought-related challenges.  This is why the Administration has directed Federal agencies to work with state and local officials in real-time to maximize limited water supplies, prioritize public health and safety, meet state water quality requirements, and ensure a balanced approach to providing for the water needs of people, agriculture, businesses, power, imperiled species and the environment.  Consistent with the 2015 Interagency Drought Strategy, the Administration and Federal agencies have partnered with state agencies in California to improve coordination of water operations in the state. In June, the Administration announced new actions and investments of more than $110 million to support workers, farmers, and rural communities suffering from drought and to combat wildfires.  This builds on the more than $190 million that agencies across the Federal government have invested to support drought-stricken communities so far this year.  Unfortunately, H.R. 2898 would undermine these efforts and the progress that has been made.  For these reasons, if the President were presented with H.R. 2898, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes S. 2193.  The bill fails to offer the comprehensive reforms needed to fix the Nation's broken immigration laws and would impose severe and unprecedented mandatory minimum sentences that would undermine the discretion of Federal judges to make sure the punishment fits the crime in each case.  The Administration continues to believe that it is critical to fix the Nation's broken immigration system through comprehensive commonsense legislation that builds on existing efforts to strengthen border security, cracks down on employers hiring undocumented workers, streamlines legal immigration, increases the efficiency of the immigration court system, and offers an earned path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to get right with the law if they pass background checks, contribute to the Nation's economy by paying taxes, and go to the back of the line.  While the Senate passed comprehensive legislation with strong bipartisan support over three years ago that would do just that, the House of Representatives failed to take any action.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bipartisan Senate bill would grow the Nation's economy by 5.4 percent and reduce Federal deficits by nearly $1 trillion over 20 years.  The Administration continues to urge the Congress to address all of the problems with the Nation's broken immigration system and take up commonsense legislation that will offer meaningful solutions to those problems.   This piecemeal legislation does not offer those kinds of reforms.  Those who reenter our country without authorization are already subject to substantial criminal penalties, and these proposed mandatory minimums are arbitrary, severe, and unprecedented.  The Congress should not undermine the discretion of judges to apply existing law and to impose penalties that fit the crime in each individual case.  Rather than focusing on this misguided legislation, the Congress should support the Administration's ongoing efforts to secure the border and keep our Nation safe.  The Administration has taken unprecedented steps to achieve those goals.  For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has deployed historic levels of front-line personnel, technology, and infrastructure to the border to reduce the flow of unlawful migration and illicit contraband while fostering legal trade and travel.  DHS is pursuing a Department-wide strategy that marshals resources from across the agency along the Southern Border and draws on experienced law enforcement officials.  The Department has put in place effective new enforcement priorities to ensure that its limited resources are focused on apprehending, detaining, and removing the worst offenders\u2014national security threats, convicted criminals, gang members, and recent border crossers.  Finally, DHS and the Department of Justice have put in place new procedures to reinforce the process for the detention and removal of immigrants who are serving sentences within the Federal corrections system.  Today, over 99 percent of  those in immigration detention fit within one of the enforcement priorities, and 91 percent of all interior removals in FY 2015 were convicted criminals.  This legislation would not advance any of those efforts.

The Administration already provides the information requested in H.R. 3442 in the form of the President's Budget, the Mid-Session Review, the Daily Treasury Statement, the Monthly Treasury Statement, the Monthly Statement of Public Debt, the Schedule of Federal Debt, and the Financial Report of the United States Government.  All of these reports are publicly available on the Internet.  In addition, Administration officials regularly make themselves available to testify before the Congress on the President's fiscal proposals and, in recent years, the Treasury Secretary has also gone before the Congress to urge it to fulfill its responsibility to raise the debt limit and underscore the potentially catastrophic consequences of failing to do so.  H.R. 3442 would provide no additional information for the Congress as it exercises its responsibility to raise the debt limit when necessary to avoid defaulting on the Nation's obligations.  The bill's reporting requirements are duplicative and redundant.    The Congress's decisions on spending and revenue policies (subject to the presidential veto) ultimately determine the level of debt and when the debt limit is reached.  It is the Congress's responsibility to raise the debt limit when needed to enable Treasury to meet obligations already incurred pursuant to legislation enacted by the Congress.  As the Administration has emphasized, the Congress should exercise that responsibility judiciously to avoid putting the Nation's creditworthiness at risk and endangering the economy.

However, as with other similar proposals, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 636, which would permanently extend and expand the current expensing provisions for small businesses, as well as two other current provisions that offer tax breaks for S-corporations, without offsetting the cost, adding to long-run deficits.  By making permanent expanded expensing for small businesses and tax breaks for S-corporations without offsets, H.R. 636 would add $79 billion to the deficit over the next ten years.  House Republicans are making clear their priorities by rushing to make business tax cuts permanent without offsets when key tax credit improvements benefiting 16 million working families with children are scheduled to expire.  They are also seeking to impose a double standard by adding to the deficit to continue and create tax breaks for businesses, after insisting on offsetting the cost of measures that help middle-class and working Americans, such as the extension of emergency unemployment benefits.

The rule allows for electronic filing and transmission of documents, ensures that all parties receive timely information necessary to participate in the election process, reduces delays caused by frivolous litigation, unifies procedures across the country, requires additional contact information be included in voter lists, and consolidates appeals to the Board into a single process. Instead of seeking to undermine a streamlined democratic process for American workers to vote on whether or not they want to be represented, the Congress should join the President in strengthening protections for American workers and giving them more of a voice in the workplace and the economy.  Growing and sustaining the middle class requires strong and vital labor unions, which helped to build this Nation's middle class and have been critical to raising workers' wages and putting in place worker protections that we enjoy today.  Giving workers greater voice can help ensure that the link is restored between hard work and opportunity and that the benefits of the current economic recovery are more broadly shared. The National Labor Relations Board's representation case procedures rule helps to level the playing field for workers so they can more freely choose to make their voice heard.  In doing so, it will help us build an economy that gives greater economic opportunities and security for middle-class families and those working to join the middle class.

The bill would undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA commitments by effectively prohibiting the United States from licensing the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran for exclusively civil end uses, as we committed to do in the JCPOA, and seeking to deter companies from pursuing permissible business with Iran.  The JCPOA has significantly constrained Iran's nuclear program \u2013 key aspects of the program are dismantled under the JCPOA, and it subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements.  It is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States to continue to meet our commitments under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its commitments.  The bill prohibits the U.S. government from authorizing transactions by U.S. financial institutions in connection with the export or re-export of commercial passenger aircraft to the Government of Iran or Iranian entities and mandates the revocation of any such licenses already issued.  Without the ability to license these transactions, the United States will be unable to fulfill one of its JCPOA commitments to the detriment of U.S. companies, foreign partners, and the world.  The commitment to license these transactions, clearly outlined in the JCPOA text, has been clear since the conclusion of the JCPOA in July 2015 and as briefed publicly by this Administration, including during the robust congressional debate on the JCPOA.  Attempts at this juncture to preclude implementation of U.S. commitments are in bad faith.   The bill further limits the role of Export-Import Bank financing by mandating vague restrictions with potentially undefined impact on commerce.  For example, the bill requires the Export-Import Bank to cancel any financial assistance issued post-enactment that has \"facilitated\" the export, sale, or lease of an aircraft to Iran or an Iranian entity.  The sweeping and vague nature of this provision would have a chilling effect on U.S. and non-U.S. entities seeking to engage in permissible business with Iran.    This bill, if enacted, would contravene U.S. commitments in the JCPOA and interfere with its successful implementation.  The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA. We fully expect that, if these measures became law, our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of our JCPOA commitments and Iran would take the issue to the Joint Commission.   Our allies have steadfastly supported us when Iran has brought  concerns to the Joint Commission, but they would be unable to do so if this legislation were enacted.  We would lose the P5+1 unity on this issue that has been and will remain critical to preserving the deal.  Continued implementation of JCPOA commitments by all participants \u2013 including the United States and our closest allies \u2013 is critical to ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interests of the United States and the international community.

H.R. 3700 contains provisions that would modify several programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including core rental assistance programs (Housing Choice Vouchers, Public Housing, and Project-Based Rental Assistance), homelessness prevention and assistance programs, and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance for condominiums.  H.R. 3700 also amends the Rural Housing Service program in the Department of Agriculture.    H.R. 3700 includes provisions that would help streamline the administration of HUD programs, particularly with respect to income determination for tenants and housing quality inspections for assisted rental housing.  The bill also would expand flexibility between public housing operating and capital funds, and would provide additional flexibility to public housing agencies to conditionally approve housing voucher units with non-life threatening deficiencies in order to allow families immediate access.  Although the Administration has supported many of the bill's reforms in previous Budgets, some of the provisions could potentially increase administrative burden and have unintended consequences.    H.R. 3700 would ease restrictions on the purchase of condominiums with FHA insurance.  While generally supportive of the revisions to the condominium project approval requirements, the Administration is concerned with the delegation of the authority to grant exceptions to HUD requirements to the lenders approving projects under the Direct Endorsement Lender Review and Approval Process.  The delegation does not appear to provide HUD with sufficient ability to set standards for exceptions and oversee their application.  Furthermore, other FHA requirements in the bill may create future difficulties for HUD in implementing timely and consistent program changes in response to market conditions.   The bill also would provide the Secretary of Agriculture with the authority to delegate some loan guarantee approval and execution functions under the guaranteed rural housing loan program, which should streamline those loans and speed up processing times.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on continuing to improve the bill as it moves forward.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes S. 3100.  This bill fails to offer comprehensive reforms needed to fix the Nation's broken immigration laws, and undermines current Administration efforts to remove the most dangerous convicted criminals and national security threats, and to work collaboratively with State and local law enforcement agencies.   The Administration continues to believe that it is critical to fix the Nation's broken immigration system through comprehensive commonsense legislation that builds on existing efforts to strengthen border security, cracks down on employers hiring undocumented workers, streamlines legal immigration, increases the efficiency of the immigration court system, and offers an earned path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to get right with the law if they pass background checks, contribute to the Nation's economy by paying taxes, and go to the back of the line.  While the Senate passed comprehensive legislation with strong bipartisan support over three years ago that would do just that, the House of Representatives failed to take any action.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bipartisan Senate bill would grow the Nation's economy by 5.4 percent and reduce Federal deficits by nearly $1 trillion over 20 years.  The Administration continues to urge the Congress to address all of the problems with the Nation's broken immigration system and take up commonsense legislation that will offer meaningful solutions to those problems.   The Administration also believes the most effective way to enhance public safety is through sensible and effective policies that focus enforcement resources on the most significant public safety threats.  The Administration has put in place new enforcement priorities that accomplish this important law enforcement goal by focusing limited resources on the worst offenders \u2013 including national security threats, convicted criminals, and gang members.  The effectiveness of these new priorities depends on collaboration between Federal, State, and local law enforcement.  Every day, the Federal government fosters State and local collaboration through a variety of mechanisms, including policies, programs, and joint task forces.  The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) enables Federal immigration enforcement to work with State and local law enforcement to take custody of individuals who are enforcement priorities before those individuals are released into communities.  PEP builds collaboration between Federal, State, and local law enforcement that allows for the most effective enforcement while enhancing community policing and trust. It is not a \"one-size-fits all\" approach.  These efforts are producing results.  Today, over 99 percent of those in immigration detention fit within one of the enforcement priorities, and 91 percent of all interior removals in FY 2015 were convicted criminals.  Additionally, the vast majority of the Nation\u2019s approximately 3,100 local law enforcement agencies are collaborating with DHS.  This bill would directly undermine these  efforts and undo the progress made in building trust between Federal, State and local law enforcement in focusing our resources on threats to public safety.   S. 3100 would also jeopardize the ability of State and local governments to receive Federal funding that is critical to their efforts to grow and revitalize their communities.  For some jurisdictions, it would deny funding for cities to implement a wide range of community development, infrastructure, and housing activities and provide vital public services, including meals to the elderly and affordable child care for low-income, working families.  The bill also would deem State and local law enforcement officials to act as the agents of Federal immigration law enforcement\u2014and to have the authority of Federal immigration law enforcement officials\u2014 in certain circumstances.  The Administration believes that these provisions would lead to mistrust between communities and State and local law enforcement agencies; undermine the ability of law enforcement to keep communities safe across the country; and impede our efforts to safely, fairly, and effectively enforce the Nation's immigration laws.   If the President were presented with S. 3100, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1675.  Among other flaws, this bill includes several provisions that pose risks to investors, are overly broad, allow financial institutions to avoid appropriate oversight, and are duplicative of existing administrative authorities.   Title III, entitled Small Business Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Brokerage Simplification, is overly broad and would eliminate registration requirements for merger and acquisition (M&A) brokers engaged on a transaction for any privately held company with gross revenues up to $250 million, thus exempting deals of significant size, and for businesses far bigger than the local small businesses the bill purports to aid.  Moreover, the legislation is duplicative insofar as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has already taken administrative action to exempt certain M&A brokers from broker-dealer registration without hindering the agency's ability to protect investors.   Additionally, Title IV, entitled Small Company Disclosure Simplification, would exempt certain publicly traded companies from requirements to file machine-readable financial statements.  Open data disclosure systems benefit investors, issuers, and the public, increasing transparency of publicly traded companies by making their filings more easily accessible.  Impeding regulators' ability to use 21st century technological tools to regulate markets and protect investors is contrary to the SEC's mission.   Lastly, Title V, entitled Streamlining Excessive and Costly Regulations Review, would require the SEC to periodically review all of its existing significant regulations and determine by Commission vote whether each regulation is outdated, among other requirements.  These requirements are unnecessarily duplicative, wasteful and costly.  The SEC already complies with the Regulatory Flexibility Act and is encouraged, under Executive Order 13579, to review rules to assess whether they are outdated or excessively burdensome.  Requiring a review and full Commission vote on every major rule every 10 years under full Administrative Procedure Act-style requirements would severely hinder the SEC's ability to monitor markets and protect investors.   If the President were presented with H.R. 1675, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of H.R. 2029, making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes.  The bill fails to fully fund critical priorities, including veterans' medical care and military construction.  Furthermore, the legislation includes a highly problematic ideological rider that would constrain the President's ability to protect our national security.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2029, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  Enacting H.R. 2029, while adhering to the congressional Republican budget's overall spending limits for fiscal year (FY) 2016 would hurt our economy and shortchange investments in middle-class priorities.  Sequestration was never intended to take effect:  rather, it was supposed to threaten such drastic cuts to both defense and non-defense funding that policymakers would be motivated to come to the table and reduce the deficit through smart, balanced reforms.  The Republican framework would bring base discretionary funding for both nondefense and defense to the lowest real levels in a decade.  Compared to the President's Budget, the cuts would result in tens of thousands of the Nation's most vulnerable children losing access to Head Start, millions fewer workers receiving job training and employment services, and drastic cuts to scientific research awards and grants, along with other impacts that would hurt the economy, the middle class, and Americans working hard to reach the middle class.  Maintaining sequestration would also negatively impact programs that provide important services to our Nation's veterans and are funded in appropriations bills where Republicans propose to make even deeper cuts relative to the President's Budget than in H.R. 2029.  For example, American Job Centers serve 1.2 million veterans annually, including 300,000 who receive intensive employment services.  Transition assistance provides 200,000 service members each year with employment guidance and information as they prepare to enter the civilian workforce.  And hundreds of thousands of veterans rely on a wide range of Department of Housing and Urban Development programs for housing support and homeless assistance each year.  Sequestration funding levels would also put our national security at unnecessary risk, not only through pressures on defense spending, but also through pressures on State, USAID, Homeland Security, and other non-defense programs that help keep us safe.  More broadly, the strength of our economy and the security of our Nation are linked.  That is why the President has been clear that he is not willing to lock in sequestration going forward, nor will he accept fixes to defense without also fixing non-defense.   The President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2029 and any other legislation that implements the current Republican budget framework, which blocks the investments needed for our economy to compete in the future.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reverse sequestration for defense and non-defense priorities and offset the cost with commonsense spending and tax expenditure cuts, as Members of Congress from both parties have urged.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.  Veterans Affairs Medical Care.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Nation's veterans; however the Administration objects to the Committee's overall $470 million reduction to the FY 2016 Budget request for Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Care.  If enacted, this reduction would negatively impact medical care services for tens of thousands of veterans and reduce VA's ability to activate new and replacement facilities with sufficient staff and equipment and to adequately maintain facility infrastructure.  Military Construction.  The Administration objects to the Committee's $355 million reduction to military construction compared to the FY 2016 Budget request, which would delay or defer projects that serve critical needs for members of our Armed Forces and their families.  The projects requested in the FY 2016 Budget reflect the highest priority projects for the Department of Defense, and the Administration requests full funding for each project.  Veterans Affairs Construction.  The Administration objects to the Committee's $117 million reduction to the FY 2016 Budget request for VA major construction.  This reduction would prevent building upgrades and renovations, including necessary expansions to medical facilities and national cemeteries that would improve services to veterans.  The funding level provided in the bill would constrain VA's ability to make progress on its highest priority capital projects.  Detainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to section 410 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This provision would constrain the flexibility that the Executive Branch needs to be able to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees, based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Digital Service Team.  The Administration appreciates that the Congress fully funded the FY 2016 Budget request for the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue support of a digital service team.  This funding will support efforts to manage digital services that have the greatest impact on citizens and businesses.  Constitutional Concerns  Several provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, section 113 of the bill may interfere with the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief and section 244 may constitute a bill of attainder.     2  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2016 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  3  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5631, H.R. 4992, and H.R. 5119, bills that would prevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  These bills would undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA commitments by reimposing certain secondary economic and financial sanctions lifted on \"Implementation Day\" of the JCPOA \u2013 the day on which the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verified Iran's completion of key nuclear-related steps. The JCPOA has significantly constrained Iran's nuclear program, including through the dismantlement of key aspects of the program, and subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements.  It is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States to continue to meet our commitments under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its commitments.    H.R. 5631 includes provisions that would prevent the Administration from implementing certain U.S. sanctions relief commitments under the JCPOA on the basis of non-nuclear related activity by Iran.  Specifically, the legislation would require the reimposition of sanctions on individuals and entities delisted on Implementation Day, as well as the re-imposition of financial and economic secondary sanctions lifted on Implementation Day, including sanctions on prominent Iranian economic sectors, such as the petrochemical sector.  In addition, this bill lacks flexibility including new waiver authorities as has typically been provided for new robust sanctions measures for continued use of sanctions in furtherance of our national security and foreign policy objectives.    H.R. 4992 contravenes United States commitments in the JCPOA, as it would reapply secondary sanctions on Iran's financial sector by prohibiting permissible financial transactions between Iran and the international community that are wholly outside the U.S. financial system.  This would amount to a harmful and unnecessary overreach, undermining the President's exercise of International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authority.  As the Administration has been clear, the United States will continue to impose our primary trade embargo on Iran, with certain limited exceptions set forth in the JCPOA, and take robust measures to protect the U.S. financial system from access by Iran.  However, this bill seeks to directly undermine Iran's conduct of banking transactions outside of the United States \u2013 activity that became permissible on Implementation Day in return for Iran meeting its nuclear-related commitments, as verified by the IAEA.    H.R. 5119 includes provisions that would foreclose the United States from procuring heavy water from Iran in the future.  Removal of excess heavy water from Iran denies Iran access to material that could be stockpiled for potential nuclear weapons production while also providing the international market access to an important commodity for research and non-nuclear industries.  As part of the JCPOA, Iran committed to a limit on the amount of heavy water that it could accumulate, but may sell its excess heavy water, further ensuring that Iran does not use this product to develop material for a nuclear weapon.  The United States does not produce heavy water.  For U.S. industry and research labs, heavy water is a critical material used for biomedical and diagnostic research \u2013 such as MRIs and pharmaceutical development \u2013 as well as for chemistry, physics and environmental analysis.  These bills, separately or collectively, thus would impact the continued viability of the JCPOA, a diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Dismantling the JCPOA would remove the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership and our commitments to our closest allies.   As we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed regarding Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region. The United States retains all of the tools it needs to counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to disrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and proliferation-sensitive technologies.  In addition, the United States remains committed to supporting our regional partners' enhancement of their defense capabilities and will continue our steadfast vigilance in enforcing multilateral export controls regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).    Continued implementation of JCPOA commitments by all participants \u2013 including the United States and our closest allies \u2013 is critical to ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States and the international community.

The Federal Reserve is an independent entity designed to be free from political pressures, and its independence is key to its credibility and its ability to act in the long-term interest of the Nation's economic health.  One of the most problematic provisions in the bill would require the Comptroller General to audit the conduct of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee.  The operations of the Federal Reserve are already subject to numerous audit requirements that ensure it is accountable to the Congress and the American people.  The only aspect of the Federal Reserve's operations not subject to audit is its monetary policy decision-making, and for good reason.  Subjecting the Federal Reserve's exercise of monetary policy authority to audits based on political whims of members of the Congress\u2014of either party\u2014threatens one of the central pillars of the Nation's financial system and economy, and would almost certainly have negative impacts on the Federal Reserve's work to promote price stability and full employment.    H.R. 3189 also would impose numerous, burdensome requirements for the Federal Reserve Board rulemaking authorities, including the imposition of a duplicative requirement that the Federal Reserve Board undertake a proscriptive cost-benefit analysis and a post-adoption impact assessment when promulgating rules.  When a Federal agency, including an independent agency such as the Federal Reserve, promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust substantive and procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act, among other statutes.  Additionally, Executive Order 13579 encourages independent regulatory agencies to conduct reasoned cost-benefit analysis, engage in public participation to the extent feasible, and conduct a systematic retrospective review of regulations.  The provisions in this bill, therefore, would create unnecessary, duplicative, and onerous requirements for an entity tasked with ensuring the financial safety and soundness of the Nation's financial system.    In addition, the bill would add a number of procedural hurdles that would impede the Federal Reserve's ability to engage with international regulatory bodies and divert its resources to unnecessary reporting requirements.  These provisions, along with provisions imposing parallel notification and consultation requirements on several other Executive Branch entities, could  impair the President's exercise of his exclusive constitutional authority to conduct the Nation's diplomatic relations.  If the President were presented with H.R. 3189, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration is strongly committed to upholding the highest accountability standards for Federal agencies and the Federal workforce, including strict standards to ensure that employees act in the best interests of the American people, and we appreciate the Congress' attention to government reform and oversight efforts.  However, certain sections of this legislation would weaken the rights of Federal employees, and be impractical and administratively burdensome to implement.  They would also have harmful unintended consequences, while failing to address the issues they are designed to solve and while raising serious constitutional concerns.  Because of this, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4361 as considered by the Rules Committee.   The Administration believes that the approach to accountability in certain provisions of the legislation is misguided.  For example, H.R. 4361 would require expedited removal procedures for agency senior executives that would raise significant constitutional concerns under the Appointments Clause and the Due Process Clause.  These procedures impose a time-constricted case review and appeal process that would permit administrative judges who are not appointed in a constitutionally appropriate manner to render removal decisions, would make those decisions final if the administrative judges fail to act within 21 days, and would deny any review of the decisions of the administrative judges by the Merit Systems Protection Board.  These procedures are substantially the same as those in section 707 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, which the Department of Justice notified the Congress in May of this year could not be defended against constitutional challenge.  These provisions would significantly alter and diminish important rights and protections that are available to the vast majority of other employees across the government and that are essential to safeguarding employees' rights.  Moreover, these provisions would hamper the Federal government's efforts to attract and retain top talent committed to serving in the Senior Executive Service.     The requirements for mandatory senior executive reassignment would be problematic to implement as written, and duplicative of existing efforts.  Under a December 2015 Executive Order, \"Strengthening the Senior Executive Service,\" agencies are already required to develop and implement a senior executive rotation plan.  The Executive Order provides a more productive approach that considers the agencies' talent and succession management plans, as well as the executive\u2019s individual development plan.  The bill would require the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to report on the use of union official time across the Executive Branch on matters not currently covered in existing OPM reporting.  The additional requirements are subjective and virtually impossible to measure.  These additional, burdensome requirements would have to be manually gathered for approximately 2,000 local bargaining units across the Executive Branch, making it challenging, if not impossible, to meet the statutory deadlines established by the bill.   In addition to objectionable personnel policy provisions, this bill would set policy that would undermine existing government-wide cybersecurity and records management policies.  Amending individual agency records management practices is unnecessary and would set a problematic precedent, as the Federal Records Act already provides clear, transparent, and effective requirements for managing Federal records.    Finally, the \"Midnight Rule\" provisions in this bill would infringe on the powers of the President to faithfully execute the laws in the final months of the term.  They would arbitrarily prohibit the issuance of key rules and thus prevent the implementation of laws passed by the Congress through otherwise lawful, well-justified, and beneficial regulations, and would also subject the rulemaking process to additional, unnecessary judicial review provisions.

The Administration continues to believe that it is critical to fix the Nation's broken immigration system through comprehensive commonsense legislation that builds on existing efforts to strengthen border security, cracks down on employers hiring undocumented workers, streamlines legal immigration, and offers an earned path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants to get right with the law if they pass background checks, contribute to the Nation's economy by paying taxes, and go to the back of the line.  While the Senate passed comprehensive legislation with strong bipartisan support over two years ago that would do just that, the House of Representatives failed to take any action.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bipartisan Senate legislation would also grow the Nation's economy by 5.4 percent and reduce Federal deficits by nearly $850 billion over 20 years.

The Administration has put in place new enforcement priorities that accomplish this important law enforcement goal by focusing limited resources on the worst offenders \u2013 national security threats, convicted criminals, gang members, and recent border crossers.  The effectiveness of these new priorities depends on collaboration between Federal, State, and local law enforcement.  Every day, the Federal government fosters State and local collaboration through a variety of mechanisms, including policies, programs, and joint task forces.  The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) enables Federal immigration enforcement to work with State and local law enforcement to take custody of individuals who are enforcement priorities, including public safety and national security threats, before those individuals are released into communities.  PEP is a balanced, commonsense approach to enforcing the Nation's immigration laws.  It replaced the Secure Communities program, which, by establishing a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to State and local cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement officials, discouraged some localities from turning over dangerous individuals to DHS custody.  Secure Communities was embroiled in litigation and widely criticized for undermining State and local community policing efforts.  PEP builds collaboration between Federal, State, and local law enforcement that allows for the most effective enforcement while enhancing community policing and trust.  The vast majority of the Nation\u2019s approximately 3,100 local law enforcement agencies are collaborating with DHS  through the PEP program, and more than half of the approximately 340 jurisdictions that previously declined to cooperate with DHS are now working with DHS under PEP.  The Congress should give PEP a chance to work, instead of displacing that collaborative approach\u2014which prioritizes the worst offenders\u2014with the coercive approach of this bill, which makes no such differentiation.  The bill would also jeopardize the ability of State and local governments to receive Federal funding that is critical to their efforts to ensure public safety and to tackle serious problems facing their communities.  For some jurisdictions, it would deny funding for cities to implement a wide range of community development and housing activities, including public safety enhancements and neighborhood-based community policing efforts and investments to increase access to affordable housing, and eliminate blight and support neighborhood planning.  The bill would also essentially turn State and local law enforcement into Federal immigration law enforcement officials, in certain circumstances.  The Administration believes that these provisions would lead to mistrust between communities and State and local law enforcement agencies; undermine the ability of law enforcement to keep communities safe across the country; and impede our efforts to safely, fairly, and effectively enforce the Nation's immigration laws.

The Act added reproductive health decisions to the list of employment non-discrimination protections included under the basis of sex, which had previously included pregnancy, childbirth, related medical conditions, and breastfeeding.  By taking away this newly-added protection, H.J. Res. 43 would undermine the reproductive freedom and private health care decisions of the citizens of the District of Columbia.  This legislation would give employers cover to fire employees for the personal decisions they make about birth control and their reproductive health.  These personal decisions should not jeopardize anyone's job or terms of employment.   The Act preserves the current exception in the District's Human Rights Law for religious entities and does not impose additional requirements on employers, contrary to their personal beliefs, to provide insurance coverage related to reproductive health decisions.  H.J. Res 43 would also have the unacceptable effect of undermining the will of District of Columbia citizens.  While the Home Rule Act of 1973 created a procedure for the Congress to overturn laws passed by the District of Columbia, the Congress has not exercised this authority in over two decades and should refrain from doing so in this circumstance, as well.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the President\u2019s FY 2016 Budget proposal allowing the District to enact local laws and spend local funds in the same way as other cities and States.  If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 43, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this resolution. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes this bill because it would undermine critical consumer protections by exempting all depository financial institutions, large and small, from QM standards\u2014including very basic standards like verifying a consumer's income\u2014as long as the mortgage loans in question are held in portfolio by the institution.  This bill would undermine the essential protections provided under the Qualified Mortgage rule.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the mortgages offered legal protections under the bill would likely default at a greater rate than the qualified mortgages with current legal protections.  For these reasons, if the President were presented with H.R. 1210, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5631, H.R. 4992, and H.R. 5119, bills that would prevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  These bills would undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA commitments by reimposing certain secondary economic and financial sanctions lifted on \"Implementation Day\" of the JCPOA \u2013 the day on which the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verified Iran's completion of key nuclear-related steps. The JCPOA has significantly constrained Iran's nuclear program, including through the dismantlement of key aspects of the program, and subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements.  It is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States to continue to meet our commitments under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its commitments.    H.R. 5631 includes provisions that would prevent the Administration from implementing certain U.S. sanctions relief commitments under the JCPOA on the basis of non-nuclear related activity by Iran.  Specifically, the legislation would require the reimposition of sanctions on individuals and entities delisted on Implementation Day, as well as the re-imposition of financial and economic secondary sanctions lifted on Implementation Day, including sanctions on prominent Iranian economic sectors, such as the petrochemical sector.  In addition, this bill lacks flexibility including new waiver authorities as has typically been provided for new robust sanctions measures for continued use of sanctions in furtherance of our national security and foreign policy objectives.    H.R. 4992 contravenes United States commitments in the JCPOA, as it would reapply secondary sanctions on Iran's financial sector by prohibiting permissible financial transactions between Iran and the international community that are wholly outside the U.S. financial system.  This would amount to a harmful and unnecessary overreach, undermining the President's exercise of International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) authority.  As the Administration has been clear, the United States will continue to impose our primary trade embargo on Iran, with certain limited exceptions set forth in the JCPOA, and take robust measures to protect the U.S. financial system from access by Iran.  However, this bill seeks to directly undermine Iran's conduct of banking transactions outside of the United States \u2013 activity that became permissible on Implementation Day in return for Iran meeting its nuclear-related commitments, as verified by the IAEA.    H.R. 5119 includes provisions that would foreclose the United States from procuring heavy water from Iran in the future.  Removal of excess heavy water from Iran denies Iran access to material that could be stockpiled for potential nuclear weapons production while also providing the international market access to an important commodity for research and non-nuclear industries.  As part of the JCPOA, Iran committed to a limit on the amount of heavy water that it could accumulate, but may sell its excess heavy water, further ensuring that Iran does not use this product to develop material for a nuclear weapon.  The United States does not produce heavy water.  For U.S. industry and research labs, heavy water is a critical material used for biomedical and diagnostic research \u2013 such as MRIs and pharmaceutical development \u2013 as well as for chemistry, physics and environmental analysis.  These bills, separately or collectively, thus would impact the continued viability of the JCPOA, a diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Dismantling the JCPOA would remove the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership and our commitments to our closest allies.   As we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration remains clear-eyed regarding Iran's support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activity in the region. The United States retains all of the tools it needs to counter this activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to disrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and proliferation-sensitive technologies.  In addition, the United States remains committed to supporting our regional partners' enhancement of their defense capabilities and will continue our steadfast vigilance in enforcing multilateral export controls regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).    Continued implementation of JCPOA commitments by all participants \u2013 including the United States and our closest allies \u2013 is critical to ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States and the international community.   The President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA.

The bill would impose arbitrary, unnecessary, and expensive requirements that would seriously impede the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) ability to use science to protect public health and the environment, as required under an array of environmental laws, while increasing uncertainty for businesses and States.  H.R. 1030 could be used to prevent EPA from proposing, finalizing, or disseminating any \"covered action\" until legal challenges about the legitimate withholding of certain scientific and technical information are resolved.  Provisions of the bill could be interpreted to prevent EPA from taking important, and possibly legally required, actions, where supporting data is not publicly available, and legal challenges could delay important environmental and health protections.  For example, the data underlying some scientifically-important studies is not made broadly available in order to protect the privacy of test subjects, and modeling that EPA uses for a variety of purposes are not EPA property and therefore cannot be publicly released.  H.R. 1030 could interfere with EPA's ability to take actions based on such data.  In short, the bill would undermine EPA's ability to protect the health of Americans, would impose expensive new mandates on EPA, and could impose substantial litigation costs on the Federal government.  It also could impede EPA's reliance on the best available science. Instead of an overly broad bill that would tie EPA's hands, the Administration urges the Congress to support the Administration's efforts to make scientific and technical information more accessible and regulations more transparent.  A bill consistent with the principles expressed in the Administration's Executive Order 13563 \"Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review\" and the December 2010 Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Memorandum on Scientific Integrity, as well as implementation of the Administration's recent open data and public access initiatives (e.g., OSTP's February 2013 policy memorandum on Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research) would greatly benefit the American people.

If the President were presented with H.R. 3192, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act.  The Rules Committee Print of H.R. 2357 contains the text of H.R. 2357 as reported (Title I), as well as texts of H.R. 4850, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, as reported (Title II), and H.R. 4852, the Private Placement Improvement Act, as reported (Title III).  Markets function most efficiently when they are transparent, well-regulated, and trusted by investors and issuers alike.  These bills would reduce transparency and inhibit effective regulatory oversight of our capital markets by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  These bills would undermine not only the health and integrity of our markets, but the very capital formation process they claim to promote.   H.R. 2357 (Title I) would weaken investor protections by reducing the quality or availability of information needed to make informed investment decisions.  By compelling the SEC to amend Form S-3, the bill would: (1) allow microcap companies traded on an exchange to issue an unlimited number of shares using shelf registration within a 12-month period; and (2) permit unlisted microcap companies, including those listed on the \"pink sheets,\" with less than $75 million in common equity to sell up to 1/3 of the market value of their common equity using shelf registration in a 12-month period.  This bill would harm investors by reducing disclosure requirements and infringe on the SEC's ability to appropriately respond to market developments.  Such changes would increase the risks posed by accounting fraud, market manipulation, insider trading, and the sale of artificially-inflated stock.    H.R. 4850 (Title II) would similarly undermine investor protections and the integrity of capital formation for small businesses.  Specifically, the bill eliminates all existing investor protections for crowdfunding and Regulation A offerings, provided that the securities: (1) are sold to purchasers with a substantive pre-existing relationship with individuals affiliated with the company, including controlling investors; (2) involve 35 or fewer purchasers; (3) do not exceed more than $500,000, annually; and (4) do not involve a person who has violated the securities laws.  These criteria do not negate the need for consumer protections embedded in current regulations.  This legislation would create yet another unnecessary and unwarranted exemption from the Securities Act of 1933 to enable the sale of microcap offerings (those involving sales of securities valued at $500,000 or less in a single year) without appropriate regulatory protections.  While the legislation would limit the total number of investors in such offerings, it lacks a requirement that those investors have the financial sophistication to understand potential risks of the offering or the financial means to withstand losses.  It requires only that they have a \"pre-existing relationship\" with an officer, director, or major shareholder of the issuer, a condition that provides no meaningful protections.    Finally, H.R. 4852 (Title III) runs counter to SEC efforts to enhance disclosure requirements, limiting the SEC's ability to finalize previously proposed investor protections, and would weaken other key consumer protections and provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  Additionally, H.R. 4852 bars the SEC from taking appropriate actions to provide needed oversight of the financial markets, encourages widespread non-compliance with existing SEC filing requirements, and undermines the SEC's informed policymaking.

The bill would, among other things, change existing revenue sharing laws to increase the amount that certain States and counties would receive from energy production on Federal lands and waters, thereby reducing the fair return on the development of these minerals to taxpayers across the country for their shared resources.  S. 3110 would have significant and long-term costs to the Federal Treasury.    The Department of the Interior, which oversees the development of about 23 percent of domestic energy supplies collects, on average, over $10 billion annually from the development of Federal minerals, including fossil and renewable energy resources.  Various statutes govern how these revenues are allocated depending on the resource type and location.  About half of the Federal revenue from onshore energy development is shared with States or counties, with the remainder deposited in the Treasury, where it offsets annual appropriations or otherwise contributes to deficit reduction.  The majority of revenue generated from offshore energy leases on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) goes to the Treasury, while a portion goes to fund important Federal conservation programs through contributions to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Historic Preservation Fund.  Through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA), the amount of OCS revenue allocated to revenue sharing payments to nearby States and counties is already set to increase dramatically in fiscal year 2018.  The Administration takes seriously its responsibility to the public for the stewardship of the Nation's energy resources and public assets that generate royalty revenue from Federal leases.  It remains committed to ensuring that American taxpayers receive a fair return from the sale of public resources owned by all Americans.  That is why the President's 2017 Budget proposes to redirect future GOMESA revenue sharing payments to the dual objectives of reducing the deficit and enhancing the resilience of coastal communities nationwide to the impacts of climate change.  In contrast, the provisions of S. 3110 would ultimately reduce the fair return on the development of these minerals to taxpayers across the country for their shared resources, would result in reductions of billions of dollars in deposits to the Treasury, and would add significantly to the Federal deficit.  If the President were presented with S. 3110, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3590.

Additionally, it would increase the Federal deficit by $32.7 billion over ten years according to the Congressional Budget Office.  The Administration is always willing to work with the Congress on fiscally responsible ways to further improve health care affordability and the Affordable Care Act.  The President's Budget offers a number of proposals to do so.  However, H.R. 3590 would be a step in the wrong direction because it would increase health care spending and increase the Federal deficit, while doing little to improve the affordability of health care for middle-class families.

The American commercial launch industry is the most competitive in the world.  Over the past several years, the industry has rapidly increased its share of the global market for sending satellites and other payloads into space.  The Administration agrees with the goal of H.R. 2262 to bring more stability and certainty to this growing market.  While the Administration does not oppose House passage of the bill, it has serious concerns with certain provisions of the bill.     For example, the Administration believes that the \u201clearning period\u201d restricting Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulation of spacecraft should be extended for a shorter period than the ten-year extension through 2025 included in the bill.  Over the next few years, several American companies are expected to bring commercial orbital and sub-orbital vehicles into service.  A safety framework that relies on performance-based regulations which could be satisfied by voluntary industry consensus standards would provide for a flexible approach that enhances the overall safety of the industry.  FAA rulemaking activity prior to 2025 may promote, rather than hinder, the development of the commercial spaceflight industry, depending on the pace at which the market for private spaceflight services grows.   With respect to space resource utilization, the Administration recognizes that steps have been taken to ensure that the bill itself is consistent with the United States' international obligations. While the Administration strongly supports the bill's efforts to facilitate innovative new space activities by U.S. companies, such as the commercial exploration and utilization of space resources to meet national needs, the Administration is concerned about the ability of U.S. companies to move forward with these initiatives absent additional authority to ensure continuing supervision of these initiatives by the U.S. Government as required by the Outer Space Treaty.

H.R. 897 would weaken environmental protections under the Clean Water Act by exempting pesticide spraying from the currently required Pesticide General Permit.  Creating a new statutory exemption to the Permit is unnecessary, as it was explicitly crafted to allow immediate responses to declared pest emergencies, thereby allowing vector control methods to be applied to the possible influx of disease-carrying mosquitos.    In fact, most mosquito control districts and Federal and State agencies already have authority under the Pesticide General Permit to apply mosquitocides as needed to respond to Zika virus concerns and do not require any additional authorization under the Permit.  In rare circumstances where a mosquito control district did not seek prior coverage under the Permit, emergency provisions of the Permit are available that allow instant authorization to spray without the need for prior notification.  The Administration is committed to taking necessary steps, as quickly as possible, to protect the American people from the Zika virus.  Rebranding legislation that removes important Clean Water Act protections for public health and water quality is not an appropriate avenue for addressing the serious threat to the Nation that the Zika virus poses.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 596.  The House has now attempted to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times.  H.R. 596 would take away critical benefits and health care coverage from hard-working middle class families.  In addition to taking away Americans' health care security, the bill would increase the deficit, removepolicies that have helped slow health care cost growth and improve the quality of care patients receive, and detract from the work the Congress could be doing to further job creation and economic growth. The Affordable Care Act is not only working, it is fully integrated into an improved American health care system.  Discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is a thing of the past.  And under the Affordable Care Act, we've seen the slowest growth in health care prices in nearly 50years, benefiting all Americans. Repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean that Health Insurance Marketplaces where millions of Americans now compare private insurance plans and get tax credits to purchase them would shut down.  Tax credits for small business owners who cover their employees would be taken away.  States would lose substantial Federal assistance under Medicaid to provide coverage for the neediest Americans.  According to the most recent projections by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 27 million Americans are expected to gain coverage due to the law.  Repeal will likely result in most of these individuals remaining uninsured or losing their insurance altogether.  An estimated 10 million Americans gained coverage during 2014, and repealing the law would erase most of these coverage gains and strip these Americans of the security and peace of mind they now have.   Further, repealing the health care law would have implications far beyond Americans who have or will gain insurance. More than 250 million Americans with insurance \u2013 private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid \u2013 would lose the benefits and protections they receive under the health care law.  Insurance companies would no longer have to cover as dependents millions of young adults who have been able to stay on or sign up on their parents' plans.  Lifetime limits and restrictive annual limits on coverage could be reimposed.  Women could be charged more than men and up to 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions would be at risk of not being able to access or affordhealth coverage.  Policies that promote efficiency and accountability in health care and health insurance would be erased. Reforms that strengthen Medicare's long-term finances also would be repealed.  Seniors also would lose the more generous prescription drug coverage provided under the health care law, as well as free preventive care, and Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would become  insolvent years earlier.  Moreover, by repealing these reforms to Medicare and other reforms that encourage doctors and hospitals to provide efficient, high-quality care, the legislation would drive up costs and worsen patient care throughout our health care system. CBO has previously estimated that repealing the health care law would add more than $100 billion to the deficit over the ten years ending in 2022, and more than $1 trillion in the following decade.  This not only hurts the Government: it hurts State and local economies, job creation, and the Nation's long-term prosperity.The last thing the Congress should do is refight old political battles and take a massive step backward by repealing basic protections that provide security for the middle class.

TIFIA has supported many of the Nation's largest and most innovative public-private partnerships and enjoys immense support among local and State governments. Through TIFIA, Federal dollars are leveraged ten to one, providing a strong return on investment.   In addition to inadequate funding levels, the Administration has a number of other specific concerns.  H.R. 22 contains several objectionable provisions that would undermine the safety of the Nation's transportation system.  These include: requirements mandating that the Department of Transportation (DOT) stop publishing critical safety data about trucks and buses; prohibitions on the performance of safety inspections of operating passenger motor coaches; and new obstacles to implementing DOT's recent rule on pneumatic brake system technology that would prevent accidents involving rail tank cars transporting flammable liquids.    On permitting reform, while the Administration shares the commitment in the bill to expediting project delivery and appreciates the inclusion of many Administration proposals, some provisions, such as those encouraging further delegation of Federal authorities to States, could create inconsistency across the country and inefficiency in implementation. H.R. 22 also includes two provisions that would modify the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's regulatory process. First, it may force the agency into negotiated rulemakings in certain circumstances; negotiated rulemakings have proven costly and inefficient, and the Administration opposes this change. Second, it would require periodic review of agencies' regulations, but the Administration has already established an effective retrospective review process without legislation.    The Administration also reiterates the critical importance of making the investments necessary to modernize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and ensure it continues to support U.S. energy  security.  In keeping with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, SPR sales authorized to generate revenues for surface transportation funding should be carried out in a way that is fully consistent with the Department of Energy's ability to invest in the SPR and the President's authority to fully utilize the SPR.  In contrast to the inadequate funding levels and concerning provisions in H.R. 22, the GROW AMERICA Act would provide robust funding for all modes of surface transportation, shortening commute times and expediting travel for families and freight.  The GROW AMERICA Act would also streamline project approval processes, implement innovative transportation policies to make better use of taxpayer dollars, and codify and expand the extraordinarily popular TIGER program.  The Administration's proposal is fully paid for in each of the six years authorized in the Act through existing revenues and by reforming the international business tax system to help create jobs and spur investment while eliminating loopholes that reward companies for moving profits overseas.  Notwithstanding the concerns above, the Administration strongly supports the provisions reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, or \"EXIM,\" which is a critical tool in the bipartisan trade agenda that helps U.S. businesses succeed in global markets and grow their exports, resulting in more Made-in-America exports and more well-paying jobs supported in cities and towns here in the United States, rather than overseas.  With more than 80 export credit agencies worldwide, EXIM ensures that American businesses can compete on a level playing field.  Despite bipartisan support for reauthorization in both the House and the Senate, EXIM's full authority lapsed on June 30, 2015.  This has left American businesses and American workers without access to important financing tools that help high quality and innovative American-made products compete in markets all around the world.  The Senate passed a long-term EXIM reauthorization with 64 Members in support and the House recently passed identical legislation that garnered well over two-thirds support of the House.  In FY 2014, EXIM supported 164,000 U.S. jobs and sent $675 million in deficit-reducing receipts to the U.S. Treasury. However, the Administration strongly opposes the addition of any amendments to the legislation that would hinder EXIM's ability to promote U.S. businesses.  The Administration is focused every day on what can be done to expand opportunity for every American.  For America to succeed, we need the best, safest infrastructure in the world, and the Federal Government needs to lead the way.  We look forward to continuing to work with the Congress to pass a more meaningful transportation bill and an EXIM reauthorization.   * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are tailored to advance statutory goals in a manner that is efficient and cost-effective, and that minimizes uncertainty.  By layering on additional, burdensome judicial review and other unnecessary changes to the regulatory process, H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2015, would introduce needless uncertainty into agency decision-making and undermine the ability of agencies to provide critical public health and safety protections.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 50. When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and well- understood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been guided by executive orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, to promote regulatory flexibility, and to reach out to the parties affected by their rules, including State, Tribal and local governments.   The President's regulatory approach has been consistent throughout his Administration.  We don't have to choose between protecting the health, welfare, and safety of Americans and promoting economic growth, job creation, competitiveness, and innovation \u2014 we can do both.  To this end, Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased public participation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, and flexible regulatory approaches.  Furthermore, existing executive orders and other presidential directives ask agencies to ensure that they take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.  Through Executive Orders 13579 and 13610, the Administration has also taken important steps to promote systematic retrospective review of regulations by all agencies.  These executive orders also encourage independent agencies to conduct retrospective review of regulations.  Collectively, these requirements promote flexible, cost-effective regulation. H.R. 50 would create needless grounds for judicial review, unduly slowing and increasing the cost of the regulatory process.  Creating new requirements subject to judicial review would unnecessarily add to the already robust analytical and procedural requirements of the rulemaking process, and potentially lowers the flexibility of future Administrations of either party to tailor regulatory review procedures to changing circumstances.   If H.R. 50 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2 because it would reform the flawed Medicare physician payment system to incentivize quality and value (a proposal called for in the President's Fiscal Year 2016 Budget), would make reforms that could help slow health care cost growth, and would extend other important programs such as health care coverage for children.    Medicare payments to physicians are determined under a formula, commonly referred to as the \"sustainable growth rate\" (SGR).  This formula has called for reductions in physician payment rates since 2002, which the Congress has overridden 17 times.  Under the SGR, physician payment rates would be reduced by about 21 percent on April 1, 2015.  A cut of this magnitude could reduce access to physicians for Medicare beneficiaries throughout the country.  H.R. 2 would replace this system with one that offers predictability and accelerates participation in alternative payment models that encourage quality and efficiency.  The proposal would advance the Administration's goal of moving the Nation's health care delivery system toward one that achieves better care, smarter spending, and healthier people through the expansion of new health care payment models, which could contribute to slowing long-term health care cost growth.  The Administration also supports the legislation's inclusion of a continuation of policies and funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  The President's Budget includes a four-year extension of this program, which has provided meaningful health coverage to over eight million children; extending CHIP would ensure continued, comprehensive, affordable coverage for these children.  H.R. 2 also includes other important proposals in the President's Budget, such as an extension of the Home Visiting Program and additional funding for the Community Health Center (CHC) Fund, although the legislation includes restrictions on the use of the CHC Fund which would be unnecessary given Executive Order 13535.  The Administration supports the legislation's provision to make permanent the Qualifying Individual program, which pays the Medicare Part B premiums for certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries.  The legislation would pay for costs above what is needed to hold Medicare payments to physicians fixed at their current level.  The savings would come from sensible reforms, which are expected to cover a larger share of the bill's costs over the long run.  These include cost-saving changes to Medicare provider payments as well as increases in the income-related premium for certain high-income Medicare beneficiaries, who represent about five percent of those covered by Medicare.  A similar proposal was included in the President's Budget to help improve the financial stability of the Medicare program by reducing the Federal subsidy of Medicare costs for those who need the subsidy the least.  The bill also would, starting in 2020, prohibit Medicare Supplemental Insurance (Medigap) policies from covering the Part B deductible (currently $147) for new beneficiaries.  This would encourage more efficient health  care choices, lowering Medicare costs and Medigap premiums.  * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2647.  The most important step Congress can take to increase the pace and scale of forest restoration and management of the national forests and Department of the Interior (DOI) lands is to fix fire suppression funding and provide additional capacity for the Forest Service and DOI to manage the Nation\u2019s forests and other public lands.  H.R. 2647 falls short of fixing the fire budget problem and contains other provisions that will undermine collaborative forest restoration, environmental safeguards, and public participation across the National Forest System and public lands.  Wildland Fire Management Funding  The Administration appreciates that there is bipartisan agreement that wildland fire management funding needs a legislative fix.  The reasons are clear:  in fiscal year (FY) 1995, the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture (USDA) spent 16 percent of its budget on firefighting.  Today the agency spends more than half of its budget on fire management activities.  This fundamentally impedes its missions, including taking critical funding from programs that help reduce the risk of catastrophic fire, maintain healthy functioning ecosystems, and yield timber production.  The wildland fire funding fix in the President\u2019s FY 2016 Budget provides the necessary resources for the Forest Service as well as DOI to address wildland fire suppression and rehabilitation needs without resorting to detrimental transfers from other critical forest landscape resilience priorities.  Under this fix, which includes a discretionary budget cap adjustment, the Forest Service and DOI could tap disaster funds once they spend 70 percent of their 10-year average of suppression spending, which is the amount of suppression funding requested within the discretionary budget caps.  Providing this certainty would preserve critical resources for hazardous fuel reduction and other essential landscape restoration projects, allowing for more acres to be treated, and thereby reducing the risk of fire, and the degree of fire destruction.   The Administration\u2019s proposal would immediately increase the Forest Service\u2019s capacity to plan and execute restoration projects -- including the FY 2016 Budget projection for timber volume sold from 2.9 billion board feet in FY 2014 to 3.2 billion board feet.    In contrast, the requirement in H.R. 2647 to fully fund the ten-year average for wildland fire suppression would mean that less funding is available each year in the agencies\u2019 budgets for restoration and risk reduction programs as it is diverted to the ever-increasing ten-year average.     Additionally, the bill repurposes the Stafford Act.  The purpose of the Stafford Act is to provide Federal assistance to State, local, and tribal governments to alleviate disaster suffering and facilitate recovery.  This bill would instead establish a sub-account within the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) to provide funding for USDA and DOI to perform wildland fire suppression operations on Federal land when suppression funding is exhausted and the President has issued a disaster declaration for such fires.  A proposed sub-account under the DRF should not be used to redirect DRF resources in support of non-Stafford responsibilities or to circumvent existing major disaster declarations processes  Undermining Fundamental Environmental Safeguards  The Administration takes seriously the management of Federal lands consistent with the principles of multiple-use and sustained-yield that are fundamental to the National Forest Management Act and the Federal Land Management and Policy Act and in accordance with long-standing environmental laws including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, among others.  Application of these environmental laws ensures that management activities recognize the economic benefits of Federal lands and the wide range of goods and services that these lands produce.  At the President\u2019s direction, Federal agencies, like the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, are working diligently to promote efficiencies in the permitting and land management process.  For example, the Forest Service has established additional categorical exclusions for restoration work, has expanded the use of focused environmental assessments, is using adaptive management to allow decisions to last longer, and is better training employees to take advantage of new efficiencies.  The Forest Service is also developing new approaches in the wake of catastrophic fires, such as the response to the Rim Fire, which burned 257,000 acres in the summer of 2013, in which the Stanislaus National Forest finalized its NEPA work for restoration and salvage in one year.  The Forest Service is also developing projects across larger areas, thereby utilizing efficiencies and providing a longer term and more certain timber supply for local mills.  For example, the Black Hills National Forest is implementing a landscape scale approach across 200,000 acres for treating current and future pine beetle outbreaks.   HR 2647 includes several provisions that will undermine collaborative, landscape-scale forest restoration by undermining public trust in forest management projects and by limiting public participation in decision-making.  The Administration has substantial concerns with the design and scale of the categorical exclusions, provisions related to post-fire salvage and restoration (including unrealistic timelines for environmental assessments), and unrealistic targets for reforestation given current budgetary resources.    The Administration has serious concerns with provisions in the bill related to the Resources Advisory Committees (RACs). The Administration opposes provisions that limit the discretion of RACs by requiring 50 percent of Secure Rural Schools Act Title II funding be spent on timber management projects.  H.R. 2647 also assumes RACs can fulfill the role of local forest collaboratives in designing forest restoration projects, though the RACs were not specially set up do this and in many cases may not have the breadth of stakeholder interest and expertise to do so effectively.  Additionally, the Administration opposes restrictions in the bill on the membership of RACs.  2  Furthermore, the Administration opposes provisions in the bill that require litigants to post a bond when challenging forest restoration projects.  As the Forest Service has demonstrated, the best way to address concerns about litigation is to develop restoration projects in partnership with broad stakeholder interests through a transparent process informed by the best available science.  Lastly, the bill should include stronger protections for ecologically sensitive areas, tribal sacred sites, and other important lands.    For the reasons set forth above, the Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2647.  The Administration looks forward to continued engagement with Congress to address forest management issues, which must begin by providing the Forest Service and DOI with a comprehensive fix to the fire budget problem.     * * * * * * *  3  ", "The Administration recognizes the need for additional energy infrastructure and supports the timely consideration of project applications.  The Administration, however, strongly opposes H.R. 1900, which would allow the automatic approval of natural gas pipeline projects if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or other Federal agencies do not issue the required permit, license, or approval within rigid, unworkable timeframes.  H.R. 1900 could create conflicts with existing statutory and regulatory requirements and practices related to agencies' programs, thereby causing confusion and increasing litigation risk.  The bill's requirements could force agencies to make decisions based on incomplete information or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time.  For these reasons, the bill may actually delay projects or lead to more project denials, undermining the intent of the legislation.  FERC has reported that, since fiscal year 2009, it has completed action on 92 percent (504 out of 548) of all pipeline applications that it has received within one year of receipt.  The small percent of decisions that have taken longer than one year involve complex proposals that merit additional review and consideration.  Further, FERC already has an existing framework to set reasonable timetables for the other Federal agencies with permit, review, or approval authority to act.  If the President were presented with H.R. 1900, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of the Senate Amendment to H.R. 4660, making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes.  The Senate Amendment to H.R. 4660 supports areas critical to the Nation's economic growth, security, and competitiveness in the global marketplace.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations process that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding unnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include reconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and national security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that would undermine an orderly appropriations process.  The Congress should not use the Senate Amendment to H.R. 4660 to advance ideological riders, which the President has made clear are unacceptable.  The President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our national security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same time, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to deliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.   The President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels \u2013 including investments in research and development that will grow the economy and enable America to remain the world leader in innovation.  The levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation and are not sufficient\u2013either in FY 2015 or beyond\u2013to ensure the Nation is achieving its full potential. For that reason, the Budget includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative\u2013evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities\u2013that presents additional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The Administration appreciates the Committee support for many of the key priorities requested in the FY 2015 Budget request, and would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.     Division 1 \u2013 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies   Department of Commerce    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The Administration supports the Committee's funding for the National Weather Service, critical weather satellites, and ocean stewardship, including regional coastal resilience grants.  The Administration urges the Congress to support high priority climate research and data collection, which is critical to helping the Nation better understand, monitor, and prepare for the impacts of climate change.   International Trade Administration.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for SelectUSA and the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center.  The funding provided will help promote job-creating business investment in the United States and ensure a level playing field for U.S. businesses overseas.    Periodic Censuses and Programs.  The Administration is deeply concerned that the bill does not provide adequate funding for the Census Bureau to produce robust economic and demographic data, or sufficiently prepare for the 2020 Decennial Census.  The President's requested funding level would save billions of dollars over the next five years by enabling the Census Bureau to conduct the necessary research, testing, and early implementation activities that are needed to contain costs in conducting the 2020 Census.     National Institute of Standards and Technology.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides the FY 2015 Budget request for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia, and Lab-to-Market Technology Transfer.  These programs will help create jobs while enhancing the competitiveness and innovative capacity of the United States.  To further strengthen U.S. manufacturing, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the additional funds requested in the FY 2015 Budget for coordination of existing and future manufacturing innovation institutes as part of a National Network of Manufacturing Innovation.    Department of Justice   State and Local Assistance Programs.  The Administration supports the Committee's overall funding level for State and Local Assistance Programs, including for the Now is the Time Comprehensive School Safety Program and for Community Teams to Reduce the Sexual Assault Kit Backlog.    Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Process Reform.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for MLAT process reform, which is critical to investigating crimes, working with foreign partners, and prosecuting terrorists and other criminals.  This funding will provide for an updated, improved, and accelerated process to handle foreign governments' requests for evidence as well as enhance mutual relationships.    General Legal Activities.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the FY 2015 Budget request for activities that support important national priorities including those related to criminal, civil, civil rights, tax, and environmental enforcement.   2  Guant\u00e1namo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 528 and 529, which would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guant\u00e1namo detainees in the United States.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation and has reiterated his call to the Congress to lift the restrictions.  As the President said in his State of the Union Address, \"this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\"  Operating the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guant\u00e1namo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Section 528 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances.   Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) Gun Riders.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that severely inhibits ATF's ability to combat illegal gun trafficking and protect the public.  This includes the requirement that ATF authorize the importation of certain \"curio and relic\" firearms simply because of their age and regardless of the danger they may pose; and the prohibition against ATF denying an application to import particular models or configurations of a shotgun that do not meet the statutory \"sporting purposes\" test.  In addition, the Administration urges the Congress to repeal a number of provisions made permanent in prior years, including a prohibition against requiring firearms dealers to conduct physical inventories and a prohibition on changing the definition of \"curio and relic\" firearms.  Executive Office of the President    Office of the U.S Trade Representative (USTR).  The Administration appreciates the $2.4 million increase over the FY 2014 enacted level, but urges the Congress to provide the FY 2015 Budget request of $56.2 million for USTR.  The $1.2 million reduction would limit USTR's ability to conduct major trade negotiations, enforce trade agreements, and pursue new and existing trade disputes.    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)   Commercial Crew Program.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Commercial Crew program, but has concerns about language that would seek to apply accounting requirements unsuitable for a firm, fixed-price acquisition, likely increasing the program's cost and potentially delaying its schedule.    Space Technology Program.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not provide the FY 2015 Budget request for the Space Technology program.  Space Technology is needed to reduce the cost and increase the long-term capability of NASA, other Government, and commercial space activities.    Future Science Missions.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for science missions, but is concerned about prematurely specifying elements of future missions while the 3  missions are in a very early state of development.  In particular, the Administration believes the Committee's proposed approach to a follow-on Landsat mission is not feasible within the bill's proposed cost cap of $650 million, and that it is premature to designate the Space Launch System as the launch vehicle for a Europa mission before the costs and benefits of such a choice are understood.   National Science Foundation (NSF)  The Administration supports the Committee's funding of NSF's top line at the requested level of $7.3 billion.  NSF invests in important research and education and lays the foundation for economic growth.    Legal Services Corporation (LSC)  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for LSC, but urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2015 Budget request of $430 million.  At the lower funding level, thousands of low- income Americans, including many military families and veterans, would be denied assistance with civil legal problems, impacting their ability to receive fair treatment in the courts.   Constitutional Concerns  Other provisions in the bill, including sections 509, 519, and 527, would also raise constitutional concerns in certain applications by intruding upon the President's constitutional authority over international diplomacy.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns.    Division 2 \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  Department of Transportation (DOT)  Surface Transportation Funding.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact the GROW AMERICA Act proposal.  This legislative proposal would provide $302 billion over four years for highways, transit, highway safety, and rail program, as well as for Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grants, and is paid for by pro-growth business tax reforms.  While the bill maintains current levels of funding for vital transportation programs, necessary improvements to the Nation's transportation network cannot be made by freezing obligation limitations for highway, transit, and highway safety at the FY 2014 authorized levels.  A robust, multi-year authorization is essential to providing States and municipalities with the long-term funding to make investments in transportation improvements that grow the economy and serve U.S. citizens.   National Infrastructure Investments.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's funding of TIGER grants at a level that would continue to support innovative projects across the Nation.  The bill clearly demonstrates the Committee's commitment to continuing transformative multimodal projects around the Nation.   Safe Transport of Energy Products.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's targeted funding increases for the Federal Railroad Administration, which would lead to improvements in 4  the safety of crude oil transport by rail.  Specifically, the bill provides increases designed to bolster the oversight of railroads' adherence to Federal safety standards, enhance the quality of information on accident risk, and improve training and coordination among agencies, railroads, and emergency responders.  For the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Administration appreciates that the Committee provides the requested funding level of $52 million for the Hazardous Materials Safety account.  It is a step toward funding the additional research, training, and outreach associated with the recent surge in oil and natural gas transportation.   Federal Transit Administration Capital Investment (New Starts) Grants.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's strong support for New Starts.  By continuing to fund projects including the building of new fixed guideway systems or extensions and improvements to existing fixed guideway systems, the Committee is helping meet Americans' demand for transit, and investing in systems which help move an increasing number of people to home or work safely.   Infrastructure Permitting Center.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee did not provide the requested funding level for the interagency permitting center, which is essential to modernizing and streamlining the Federal permitting and review process, reducing the time it takes to start infrastructure projects while improving outcomes for the environment.  The funding requested in the FY 2015 Budget supports key reforms in the Administration's comprehensive plan announced by the President last month.  The plan includes 15 reforms and nearly 100 actions to significantly improve Federal permitting to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity, and improve the competitiveness of the American economy.  Expanding and institutionalizing permitting reform Government-wide to build a 21st Century infrastructure is also a critical component of the President's Management Agenda, aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government.   Motor Carrier Safety.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that would suspend the enforcement of specific provisions in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's hours of service rule.  Specifically, the amendment to the bill would suspend the enforcement of the rule's \"restart\" provision, effectively boosting the number of hours a truck driver could work from the 70 hour maximum average on the books today, to 82 hours a week.  The current hours of service rules have been sought by the National Transportation Safety Board for many years and are now serving to prevent an additional estimated 1,400 crashes, 560 injuries, and save 19 lives a year by reducing the risk of fatigue related crashes, as fatigue remains a lead factor in the 300,000 crashes that occur each year.  The Administration also opposes provisions that change existing truck safety rules including restrictions on the modification of insurance requirements and the permissible size and weight of trucks operating on Federal highways.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), the Department of Transportation is currently conducting a comprehensive truck size and weight limits study.  Any reconsideration of size and weight limits should be done on a comprehensive basis with full consideration of the infrastructure and safety impacts as informed by the MAP-21 study.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Housing Choice Vouchers.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the 5  Housing Choice Voucher program administrative fees, which will ensure that Public Housing Authorities can ensure that units are safe and habitable.  However, the Administration is deeply concerned about the funding level provided for the Vouchers program.  The amount in the bill is insufficient to provide the same level of assistance to families as in 2014 and would not restore the funding reduction from sequestration.    Homeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration strongly opposes the funding level provided in the bill for Homeless Assistance Grants, which is $261 million below the FY 2015 Budget request, and would not allow for the development of new permanent supportive housing as part of the Administration's efforts to end chronic homelessness in 2016.    Choice Neighborhoods.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for Choice Neighborhoods, and urges the Congress to fully fund the program at the FY 2015 Budget request level of $120 million.  Choice Neighborhoods provides critical support to revitalize distressed HUD-assisted housing and build ladders of opportunity for low-income families by improving economic development, creating jobs, and increasing access to high-quality schools and education programs in surrounding communities.   Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD).  The Administration supports the Committee's funding level for RAD, including its expansion to 185,000 units.  RAD preserves critically needed Public Housing by converting it to long-term Section 8 contracts that can leverage private financing for capital improvements.   HOME Investment Partnerships Program.  The Administration strongly supports the Committee's funding level for the HOME program, which is funded at the FY 2015 Budget request.  This program is critical for increasing the supply of affordable housing for low-income families.   Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Administrative Expense.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for enhanced management by FHA and encourages the Congress to provide the full $170 million request for this activity.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee's inclusion of new fee authority that would provide offsetting collections credited against FHA administrative spending.  FHA insures a portfolio of over $1 trillion in mortgages and increased resources would improve risk management and limit claim costs.   Housing Counseling.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for Housing Counseling and encourages the Congress to provide the full $60 million request for this activity.  The requested funding level in the FY 2015 Budget would help a large number of low-income households navigate a dynamic housing market to achieve sustainable homeownership, avoid homelessness, or find quality affordable rental housing.   Division 3 \u2013 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  U.S. Department of Agriculture  Child Nutrition.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support for science-based nutrition standards for children.  School nutrition standards are developed by independent 6  experts, over 90 percent of schools report that they are successfully implementing them, and studies show they are working to help improve children's health.  The Administration strongly opposes the inclusion of any language in the bill that would override science-based standards that improve child nutrition.  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Food Package.  The Administration understands that the objective of the language in the bill that would require the inclusion of white potatoes in the WIC food package, pending further scientific review, is intended to preserve the science-based review process used to determine which foods should be included in the WIC food package.  The Administration strongly opposes the inclusion of any language in the bill that would override science-based standards that improve child nutrition.  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides sufficient funding to serve all projected WIC participants for FY 2015.  The Administration also supports the bill's provision of $150 million in contingency funds to ensure that the program has sufficient resources to meet unexpected changes in participation.     Child Nutrition School Equipment Grants.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support of school meals equipment grants, but urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2015 Budget request of $35 million to help school districts purchase the equipment needed to serve healthier meals, improve food safety, expand access to meals, and improve energy efficiency.   Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI).  The Administration is concerned that the Committee did not provide the requested $13 million for the HFFI program, which was authorized in the most recent Farm Bill.  This program would be used to support increased access to healthy foods in underserved areas, create and preserve quality jobs, and to revitalize low-income communities.   Food Aid Reform.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for P.L. 480 Title II food aid and retention of the reforms passed in FY 2014, but is concerned that the bill excludes proposed food aid reforms that would help two million more people in crises without additional resources.  At a time when major food crises are increasing, including those in South Sudan and Syria, the proposed reforms to allow more cost-effective, flexible emergency food aid are critical.   National Institute of Food and Agriculture.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee included no funding to support the three research innovation institutes, as requested in the FY 2015 Budget, and recommended by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.  These institutes would provide competitive grants to support public-private cooperation for pollinator health research, bio-based advanced manufacturing, and anti-microbial resistance, all of which are important issues facing the Nation.     Farm Service Agency (FSA).  The Administration is disappointed by the bill language that prohibits closure of FSA county offices.  The Administration is also disappointed that the Committee has reduced the FY 2015 Budget request by $33 million for the MIDAS information technology initiative as it is a critical part of FSA's modernization process.  Rental Assistance Grant Program.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funds Rental Assistance Grants at $1.1 billion.  The Administration encourages the Congress to 7  adopt the funding flexibilities proposed in the FY 2015 Budget in order to improve the management and efficiency of the program.   Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Demonstration.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund summer EBT pilots, consistent with the FY 2015 Budget request.  These pilots are proving successful in reducing childhood hunger and improving nutrition in the months when school meals are unavailable.     Department of Health and Human Services \u2013 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  User Fees.  The Administration appreciates the Committee mark for FDA, but continues to support new proposed user fees that would provide vital resources to enhance FDA's capacity to support a prevention-based food safety system.  The Congress is urged to enact these user fees as proposed in the FY 2015 Budget request.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  8  ", "The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services Committee's continued support of our national defense in S. 1197, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.  In particular, the Administration appreciates the support of the Committee for authorities that assist the Armed Forces in operating in unconventional and irregular warfare and countering unconventional threats, support capacity building efforts with foreign military forces, and support contingency or stability operations, as well as its support for the one percent pay raise for members of the uniformed services.  The Administration also commends the Committee for working to offer stronger protections for sexual assault victims.  While there are a number of areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration has serious concerns with certain provisions.  Several provisions would constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to align military capabilities and force structure with the President's strategy, impede the ability of the Secretary of Defense to reduce overhead and make programs more efficient, and constrain efforts to implement the U.S. strategy for Afghanistan.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing a classified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns on classified programs.  Detainee Matters:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's constructive proposals regarding transfers of detainees held at the U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  The Committee's provisions are a significant improvement over existing law.  Of course, even in the absence of any statutory restrictions, the Administration would transfer a detainee only if any threat the detainee poses can be sufficiently mitigated and only when consistent with our humane treatment policy.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress on refining these provisions to ensure that they provide necessary flexibility to the Executive Branch.  TRICARE Fees and Co-Payments:  The Administration believes that military retirees deserve quality, sustainable health care benefits.  For this reason, the Administration strongly supports its requested TRICARE fee initiative that seeks to control the growth of health care costs at the Department of Defense (DOD) while keeping retired beneficiaries' share of these costs well below the levels experienced when the TRICARE program was implemented in the mid-1990s.  The projected FY 2014 TRICARE savings of $902 million and $9.3 billion through FY 2018 are essential for DOD to successfully address rising personnel costs.  DOD needs these savings to balance and maintain investments for key defense priorities, especially amidst significant fiscal challenges posed by statutory spending caps.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to support the proposed TRICARE fee initiative.   Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC):  The Administration strongly objects to section 2702, which would make a formal review of the overseas military facility infrastructure a precondition for authorizing any future BRAC round.  The Administration has been reviewing DOD's overseas infrastructure, and the results of that analysis will inform future infrastructure decisions.  However, the effort to configure our overseas infrastructure in a more efficient way should not prevent the authorization of another round of BRAC analysis for domestic bases.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which would allow DOD to right size its infrastructure, while providing important assistance to affected communities.  Without authorization for a new round of BRAC, DOD may not properly align the military's infrastructure with the needs of the evolving force structure, which is critical to ensuring that limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the Armed Forces and national security.  Life Extension Program:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1043, which would require DOD and the National Nuclear Security Administration to develop cost estimates for four separate life extension program (LEP) options as part of the W78/88-1 Phase 6.2/6.2A Feasibility and Cost Study.  The current study scope will inform a cost/risk/benefit decision on a warhead with an interoperable nuclear explosive package that can be used on multiple platforms.  Including efforts to determine feasibility and costs for full scope LEPS on the W78, W88, and W87, and W78/88-1 would significantly delay completion and increase costs of the feasibility study.   Research & Development Funding Reductions:  The Administration objects to the $100 million reduction for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the $100 million reduction to the Navy's Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW) weapon development.  DARPA's innovative research leads to breakthrough discoveries and helps maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. military.  Full funding for DARPA is important to adequately support ongoing programs and initiate new research activities.  The OASuW development effort is necessary for rebalancing the Department's mix of force structure and program investments towards the Asia-Pacific theater of operations, and is essential to supporting future operations against heavily defended targets in anti-access/area-denied environments.  The OASuW's development is aligned with Combatant Commander priorities and leverages existing DARPA investments to enable delivery of required capabilities in the most expeditious and economical manner at the lowest risk.  Retention of Navy Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Platforms:  The Administration strongly objects to section 124(b)(2), which would require the Navy to maintain the current number of EP-3 aircraft allocated under the Global Force Management Allocation Plan.  The Department is executing a Joint Requirements Oversight Council-approved Maritime ISR and Targeting Transition Plan, which would maintain the ISR capability resident in the legacy force (EP-3/SPA) and develop the future force (P-8 QRC/MQ-4C Triton/Triton Multi-INT) to provide Combatant Commands with a scalable, interoperable, and persistent ISR capability.  Military Construction Projects Funded Using In-Kind Payments:  The Administration strongly objects to section 2801, which would require that military construction projects funded by in-kind payments from partner nations be submitted for congressional authorization in the annual National Defense Authorization Act.  Construction projects provided pursuant to bilateral agreements with host countries or as in-kind payment of residual value are accomplished by 2  sovereign partner nations.  This proposed change in law would result in host nations awaiting actions by the U.S. Congress before they would spend their funds for projects to be constructed in their countries.  At the very least, our partner nations would regard this process unnecessarily burdensome and interfering in their domestic defense decisions.  This requirement could have a negative effect on our ability to secure significant cost-sharing support.  Realignment of Marines Corps Forces in Asia-Pacific Region:  The Administration strongly objects to the limitations imposed by section 2821 on the obligation of funds for the realignment of U.S. Marine Corps units from Okinawa to Guam and Hawaii, a goal to which successive Administrations have remained steadfastly committed since 2006.  A key aspect of the Asia-Pacific rebalance is to create a more operationally resilient Marine Corps presence in the Pacific and invest in Guam as a joint strategic hub.  By preventing the timely obligation of United States and Government of Japan funds to implement this realignment, section 2821 would unnecessarily restrict the ability and flexibility of the President to execute our foreign and defense policies in coordination with our ally, Japan, and undermines a key component of the broader U.S. strategy in the Asia-Pacific region.  Further, the Administration has serious concerns regarding the section 2821 restrictions on the development of public infrastructure on Guam, and the lack of authorization for a military construction project (aircraft hangar) that would directly support the realignment.  These actions would raise questions among regional states about the reliability of the United States security commitments to allies in the region.  Streamlining DOD Management Headquarters:  While the Administration recognizes that there are opportunities for streamlining and reducing duplication in headquarters staffs, we object to section 905 to develop a plan with particular budgetary or fiscal targets, which would preclude the Department from appropriately sizing its workforce to meet its mission workload.  The Secretary of Defense has already issued similar guidance and the Department is planning for a 20 percent reduction in headquarters, including restructuring and streamlining DOD headquarters in the Services, the Joint Staff, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  Limitation on the Availability of Funds for the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations (TFBSO):  The Administration objects to subsection (c) of section 1533, which requires the Government of Afghanistan to agree to use future oil and mineral royalties to reimburse the United States for TFBSO-funded economic assistance.  It is not the policy of the U.S. Government to seek reimbursement for economic assistance programs.  In addition to contradicting long-standing precedent, this provision could harm U.S.-led efforts to build a sustainable Afghan economy and secure a long-term revenue source for the Afghan central government.  Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrant Visas (SIV):  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of sections 1217 and 1218, relating to authority for SIVs for certain Iraqi and Afghan nationals.  The Administration supports extension of these programs, but notes its concern with the broadening of the class of aliens who would be eligible, and considers the periods of extension provided for under sections 1217 and 1218 insufficient to meet projected program demand for either Iraq or Afghanistan.  We look forward to working with the Congress on these and other appropriate modifications to sections 1217 and 1218 to ensure Iraqi and Afghan nationals who have aided U.S. efforts in these countries through their work, and who have experienced or are experiencing an ongoing serious threat as a result, are able to apply for these visas.  Training U.S. General Purpose Forces with Military and Other Security Forces of Friendly 3  Foreign Countries:  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for authorizing training of general purpose forces of the U.S. Armed Forces with military and limited other security forces of friendly foreign countries.  However, the Administration urges that section 1203 be revised to conform to the Administration's requested purposes and authorities, including concurrence of the Secretary of State, in order to ensure that the focus remains exclusively on the intended purpose to benefit U.S. forces and remains consistent with essential foreign policy considerations.  Personnel Security Clearances:  Given recent events, the Administration opposes section 931 as we are currently conducting a comprehensive 120-day interagency Suitability and Security Processes Review under the Performance Accountability Council, led by the Office of Management and Budget.  The Administration recognizes the need to further strengthen the Personnel Security Clearance Investigations (PSI) program, but given the scope of the Review, the Administration requests that the Senate defer action and not proceed with section 931,which could create a direct conflict with the existing governance structure of a single Security Executive Agent.  The Administration is committed to engaging with the Senate Armed Services Committee and other Congressional committees on the Review's findings and recommendations to improve the security clearance process.  Supervision of the Acquisition of Cloud Computing Capabilities for Intelligence Analysis:  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of section 943, which addresses the interoperability between a DOD intelligence analysis system and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's (ODNI) Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE).  The Administration interprets this provision as allowing DOD to pursue cloud computing capabilities for the Department and does not interpret this provision as intending to supersede the DNI's current efforts with respect to IC ITE.  As a matter of good governance, the ODNI and DOD will continue their efforts to appropriately align their respective IT systems to enable their related missions.  Trans Regional Web Initiative (TRWI):  The Administration opposes section 343 because prohibiting the Secretary of Defense from expending any funds to continue the TRWI and the associated websites would effectively remove an important Military Information Support Operations tool used by the Geographic Combatant Commanders in support of their missions as directed in the Unified Command Plan.  TRWI is the Department's only synchronized online influence effort able to challenge the spread of extremist ideology and propaganda on the Web.  Earlier this year, the Department, pursuant to congressional certification requirements in section 1535 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, addressed many of the concerns raised in the Committee report by demonstrating that the TRWI is the most cost-effective means for reaching audiences which affect achievement of Geographic Combatant Commanders Theater Campaign Plan objectives.  Limitation on Allowable Cost for Contractor Employee Compensation:  The Administration commends the Senate for including section 841, which would set the cap establishing the reimbursement limit on compensation for contractor employees at $487,000.  Eliminating the current statutory formula for setting the cap -- which has caused the limit to soar by more than 300 percent from $250,000 in the mid-1990s to close to $1 million in FY 2012 - and replacing it with a more reasonable baseline is an important step in restoring fiscal responsibility to federal contracting and giving relief to taxpayers who have been saddled with paying excessive compensation costs to contractors.  We urge the Senate to apply this reform government-wide, as proposed by the Administration, so that this change can be applied uniformly and consistently to 4  all contractor employees who do business with the Federal Government, both defense and civilian.  Land Withdrawals:  The Administration urges the inclusion of the renewals of withdrawals for the China Lake, Limestone Hills, and Chocolate Mountains ranges.  These withdrawals are critical to the continued readiness of the nation's armed forces.  Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Programs:  The Administration objects to the restoration of funding for the STARBASE program, which would perpetuate the Federal Government's fragmented approach to STEM education, whereby more than 220 programs are scattered across 13 agencies.  The Administration's proposed reorganization of STEM programs would improve STEM education quality and outcomes across the Federal Government.  Constitutional Concerns:  A number of the bill's provisions, such as section 1065 and 1236, raise additional constitutional concerns, including interference with the President's authority as Commander in Chief to direct deployment and use of the armed forces and exclusive authorities related to international negotiations.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.  * * * * * * *   5  ", "The Administration strongly opposes the House amendment to Senate-passed H.J.

The House of Representatives should pass the Senate-passed H.J. Res 59 rather than propose an amendment that advances a narrow ideological agenda and threatens the Nation\u2019s economy. By including extraneous measures that have no place in a government funding bill and that the President and Senate already made clear are unacceptable, House Republicans are pushing the Government toward shutdown.

The bill provides needed resources for the near term to the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Justice, and State to support the Administration's aggressive, unified, and coordinated Federal response to the urgent humanitarian situation along the Southwest border and makes longer-term progress in stemming the flow of Central American migrants.  The Administration encourages the Congress to move forward on long-lasting solutions provided by common-sense immigration reform.  Unlike the House Republican approach, this bill responsibly addresses the humanitarian situation without injecting partisan provisions that are unworkable and would increase costs without solving the problem.  Rather than holding necessary resources hostage to partisan provisions, the Administration encourages the Congress to move forward on long-lasting solutions provided by common-sense immigration reform.  The bill also provides the necessary resources for the Department of Agriculture to address imminent wildfire suppression and rehabilitation needs without resorting to damaging transfers from other critical forest health and fire preparedness priorities.  Further, it includes the bipartisan proposal for a discretionary cap adjustment to provide funding certainty in the future for programs in the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior that often have to transfer funds to wildfire suppression during active fire seasons.   The bill provides funding to the Department of Defense to support the Government of Israel's request for critical missile defense needs.  The funding will accelerate production of Iron Dome components in order to maintain adequate stockpiles.  The Administration urges the Congress to act swiftly to pass the bill to allow a timely and effective response to these pressing needs.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1845, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act.  This bipartisan legislation would restore emergency unemployment insurance benefits that expired for 1.3 million Americans looking for work at the end of 2013.  Extending these benefits would not only help these families pay their bills but it is also one of the most cost effective ways to strengthen the economy, according to independent economists.  Historically, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to make sure that unemployment insurance continues for job-seekers during times when there are still too many Americans out of work, and it is unprecedented for the Congress to allow emergency unemployment benefits to expire at a time when long-term unemployment is as high as it is today.  The Congress should act immediately to pass this bipartisan three-month extension, restoring a vital economic lifeline for hardworking American families while giving more time for consideration of further extension through 2014.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this and other measures to grow our economy and continue to create jobs, and to help Americans looking for work.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2775 because the goal of the bill is already being accomplished while the text of the bill would create delays that could cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve.  It is time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to get into the middle-class.  The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care and has already improved many aspects of the Nation's health care system.  Beginning in October 2013, millions of low- and middle-income Americans will be eligible to receive tax credits to help them purchase insurance and cost-sharing reductions to help with out-of-pocket expenses for coverage effective January 1, 2014.  Tens of millions of Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to a pre-existing medical condition will now be covered.  The nearly one in two Americans under the age of 65 with pre-existing medical conditions will have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they cannot be dropped from their health plan or denied coverage because of those conditions. House passage of H.R. 2775 would undermine this security by delaying tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that will otherwise be provided to millions of Americans.  H.R. 2775 is unnecessary because the Secretary of Health and Human Services has already put in place an effective and efficient system for verification of eligibility for premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions.  Moreover, it would create vague standards for the Inspector General, whose office has never performed this type of prospective review, to \u201csuccessfully and consistently\u201d verify eligibility.  As a result, this legislation\u2019s unnecessary pre-certification requirement would impede opening the Marketplaces on October 1, 2013, driving up out-of-pocket health care costs for millions of Americans and reducing timely access to much-needed and long-denied affordable coverage.

Workers should not fear being fired from their jobs, harassed at their workplaces, or otherwise denied the chance to earn a living for themselves and their families, simply because of sexual orientation or gender identity.  This legislation would, for the first time in this Nation's history, make explicit in Federal law such guarantees, which are consistent with America's core values of fairness and equality.

The bill requires State surface coal mining regulatory agencies to implement the 2008 Stream Buffer Zone Rule for a mandatory implementation period, which inadequately protects drinking water and watersheds from strip mining.  H.R. 2824 limits a State's ability to tailor stream safeguards or maintain currently adopted standards, creates needless regulatory and legal uncertainty, and requires States to waste significant taxpayer dollars adopting a rule that has been vacated by a Federal court.  The Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement is developing a proposed Stream Protection Rule that provides for responsible development while protecting our communities and environment.  Updates in the proposed rule will reflect the significant technological and scientific advances in mining practices that avoid, minimize, and mitigate environmental damage from coal mining.  H.R. 2824 does not adequately address the community, environmental, and health impacts of strip mining.  It further undermines efforts to better support public health and revenue generation along with jobs in the Nation's coal-producing regions.

The legislation would intrude on women's reproductive freedom and access to health care; increase the financial burden on many Americans; unnecessarily restrict the private insurance choices that consumers have today; and restrict the District of Columbia's use of local funds, which undermines home rule.  Longstanding Federal policy prohibits the use of Federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  This prohibition is maintained in the Affordable Care Act and reinforced through the President's Executive Order 13535.  H.R. 7 would go well beyond these safeguards by interfering with consumers' private health care choices.

It would increase the deficit and detract from the work the Congress needs to do to focus on the economy and create jobs.  Repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean that Health Insurance Marketplaces where Americans could compare private insurance plans and get tax credits to purchase them would not open.  Tax credits for small business owners who cover their employees would be eliminated.  States would lose substantial Federal assistance under Medicaid to provide coverage for the neediest Americans.  But repealing the health care law would have implications far beyond the estimated 30 million Americans without insurance who would lose the health coverage they were going to receive.  More than 250 million Americans with insurance \u2013 private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid \u2013 would lose the benefits and protections they receive under the health care law.  Insurance companies would be able to go back to some of their worst practices.  They would no longer have to cover as dependents the 6.6 million young adults who have been able to stay on or sign up on their parents' plans.  They would be able to impose lifetime limits and restrictive annual limits on coverage.  They could go back to denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions.  And, they would likely turn away the approximately 100,000 Americans who had gained insurance through the Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan program, which would have to shut down immediately.  Many insurance companies would no longer be held accountable for double-digit premium increases.  Strict rules that prevent insurance companies from spending too much on administrative costs or CEO bonuses would be erased.  Reforms that strengthen Medicare's long-term finances would also be repealed.  Seniors would lose the more generous prescription drug coverage provided under the health care law, as well as free preventive care.  And Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would become insolvent up to eight years earlier.   Last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the health care law would add more than $100 billion to the deficit over the next decade, and more than $1 trillion in the following decade.  The last thing the Congress should do is refight old political battles and take a massive step backward by repealing basic protections that provide security for the middle class.

This process should include reconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and national security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an orderly appropriations process.   The President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our national security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same time, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to deliver a government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.   The President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels\u2014including investments in research and development that will grow the economy and enable America to remain the world leader in innovation.  However, the levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation and are not sufficient\u2014either in FY 2015 or beyond\u2014to ensure the Nation is achieving its full potential. For that reason, the Budget also includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative\u2014evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities\u2014that presents additional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would support additional research and development at the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Standards and Technology, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other agencies across the government that would create the businesses and jobs of the future.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve these issues during the FY 2015 appropriations process.  Department of Commerce  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the National Weather Service and critical weather satellites.  However, the Administration strongly opposes the significant reductions below FY 2014 funding levels for high priority climate research, as well as the elimination of funding for the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor that is necessary to maintain a long-term climate data record.  NOAA's climate research will help the Nation better understand, monitor, and prepare for the impacts of climate change.  In addition, the Administration opposes the reduction to NOAA's fisheries management and coastal restoration programs, including regional coastal resilience grants. These programs contribute to the long-term economic and ecosystem health of the fishing industry and coastal communities throughout the United States.   International Trade Administration (ITA).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $497 million for ITA, which would fully fund SelectUSA and the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center.  Reduced funding levels for these two priorities would undermine efforts to increase foreign investment in the United States, create jobs, and ensure a level playing field for U.S. businesses overseas.  Periodic Censuses and Programs.  The Administration objects to the inadequate funding provided to the Census Bureau to produce robust economic and demographic data, or sufficiently prepare for the 2020 Decennial Census.  The Committee's proposed funding level would increase costs by billions of dollars over the next five years by preventing the Census Bureau from conducting the necessary research, testing, and early implementation activities that are needed to contain costs in conducting the 2020 Census.   Current Population Survey (CPS) Data Collection.  The Administration strongly objects to language in the bill included in the Bureau of the Census, salaries and expenses account requiring that the data collection for CPS use outdated health insurance questions included in previous years.  The revised questions will allow the Census Bureau to better measure the uninsured, while reverting back to the previous questions will create a gap in the data and severely limit its statistical value.   National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).  The Administration opposes the funding reduction from the FY 2014 enacted level and the FY 2015 Budget request for NTIA.  This reduction would prevent NTIA from standing-up the Internet Policy Center to bolster the Administration's Internet governance and policy efforts.    National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not provide the requested increases to the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program to support small manufacturing businesses, or those that will enhance benefits from the Manufacturing Institutes Initiative.  These initiatives will help advance the development and adoption of new manufacturing technologies.  2  Department of Justice (DOJ)  State and Local Assistance Programs. The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Justice Reinvestment Initiative and the Now is the Time Comprehensive School Safety Program.  However, the Administration strongly objects to the Committee's decision to reduce funding from the requested levels for juvenile justice and delinquency prevention programs and for Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS).  The reductions in COPS funding alone would result in almost 1,000 fewer officer hires.   Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) Gun Riders.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that severely inhibits ATF's ability to combat illegal gun trafficking and protect the public.  This includes the requirement that ATF authorize the importation of certain \"curio and relic\" firearms simply because of their age and regardless of the danger they may pose; the prohibition against ATF's current practice of collecting information on the sale of multiple long guns in the Southwest Border region; and the prohibition against ATF denying an application to import particular models or configurations of a shotgun that do not meet the statutory \"sporting purposes\" test.  In addition, the Administration urges the Congress to repeal a number of provisions made permanent in prior years, including a prohibition against requiring firearms dealers to conduct physical inventories and a prohibition on changing the definition of \"curio and relic\" firearms.   Working Capital Fund and Assets Forfeiture Fund Restrictions.  The Administration strongly opposes the limitations included in the bill for the Working Capital Fund and Assets Forfeiture Fund that would severely restrict DOJ's ability to fund essential requirements of its financial management system consolidation efforts, to pay for other vital unfunded capital equipment needs, and to cover the costs of unanticipated expenses.  The Department must regain its ability to use the Working Capital Fund and Assets Forfeiture Fund spending authorities in order to minimize the financial impact to programs critical to public safety and national security while improving financial reporting, accountability, and law enforcement capabilities.   Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT). The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for MLAT process reform, which is critical to investigating crimes, working with foreign partners, and prosecuting terrorists and other criminals.  This funding will provide for an updated, improved, and accelerated process to handle foreign governments' requests for evidence as well as enhance mutual relationships.   Guant\u00e1namo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 528 and 529, which would prohibit the use of funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States and for the construction, acquisition, or modification of any facility to house Guant\u00e1namo detainees in the United States.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation and has reiterated his call to Congress to lift the restrictions.  As the President said in his State of the Union Address, \"this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\"  Operating the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners and emboldening violent extremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guant\u00e1namo detainees based on the facts and 3  circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Section 528 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances.  Executive Office of the President  Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $56.2 million for USTR.  The funding reduction would limit USTR's ability to conduct major trade negotiations, enforce trade agreements, and pursue new and existing trade disputes.   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  Commercial Crew Program.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for NASA, but is disappointed the bill does not provide the full funding request for the Commercial Crew Program.  The lower funding level for the program jeopardizes the goal of sending astronauts to the International Space Station on American spacecraft by 2017 and will likely extend the period of time NASA needs to rely on Russia for transport to and from the Station. The Administration also encourages the Congress to support competition in the program, which is important to lowering risk and reducing prices in the long term.    Space Technology Program.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not fund the full request for the Space Technology program.  Space Technology is important to reducing the cost and increasing the capability of NASA, other Government, and commercial space activities.    National Science Foundation (NSF)  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for NSF.  NSF invests in important research and education and lays the foundation for economic growth.   Legal Services Corporation (LSC)  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided in the bill for LSC, which is $80 million below the FY 2015 Budget request.  At this funding level, tens of thousands of low-income Americans, including many military families and veterans, would be denied assistance with civil legal problems, impacting their ability to receive fair treatment in the courts.  The Administration also opposes the Committee's decision not to lift the prohibition against filing class action lawsuits or restrictions on the use of non-LSC funds by LSC grantees as requested in the Budget.   Constitutional Concerns  Other provisions in the bill, including sections 509, 519, and 527, would also raise constitutional concerns in certain applications by intruding upon the President's constitutional authority over international diplomacy.

H.R. 2374 prohibits Labor from issuing a rule to protect investors until the SEC engages in and completes further study of the effect of a rulemaking on retail investors.  The bill ignores the fact that significant work has already been conducted in both agencies and that the agencies have included and continue to include the public, industry, and numerous stakeholders in their rulemaking processes.  Moreover, the two agencies are already working closely to avoid conflicting requirements for the regulated community, and this legislation would hamper effective coordination between the two agencies.  The bill would hinder efforts to protect consumers from conflicts of interest among brokers, dealers, financial advisors, and others whose incentives may be misaligned with investors, potentially leading to deceptive and abusive practices.     The Administration is committed to ensuring that American workers and retirees are able to receive advice about how to invest their money in safe, secure, and transparent financial products that is free from harmful conflicts of interest.  These ongoing rulemakings are designed to protect trillions of dollars in retirement savings of millions of workers and retirees by ensuring that paid advisors and other entities do not place their own financial interests over those of their customers.  This legislation would place an unnecessary obstacle in the way of these efforts to prevent such harmful conflicts of interest, which hurt businesses, consumers, and retirees and their families.

Extending these benefits would not only help these families pay their bills but it is also one of the most cost effective ways to strengthen the economy, according to independent economists.   Historically, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to make sure that unemployment insurance continues for job-seekers during times when there are still too many Americans out of work.

Transitioning to actuarially sound rates will help ensure that the NFIP has adequate resources to pay policyholders\u2019 future claims without increasing the program\u2019s debt levels.    Title I of S. 1926 would delay implementation of provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 that require the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to move to full risk-based premium rates for certain properties.  Delaying implementation of these reforms would further erode the financial position of the NFIP, which is already $24 billion in debt.  This delay would also reduce FEMA's ability to pay future claims made by all policyholders.  FEMA is working diligently with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on insurance affordability for economically distressed policyholders pursuant to the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012.  The Administration recognizes that many policyholders may be challenged financially by the new rates and remains committed to working with the Congress to develop approaches that ensure economically distressed policyholders are not unduly burdened while maintaining the financial stability of the NFIP.   The Administration supports the policy goals of Title II of S. 1926, which would establish a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) as a mechanism for individuals and companies that sell insurance to be licensed to sell insurance in States other than their home State without having to be separately licensed in each State.    The Administration, however, is concerned that the bill provides a process for conducting criminal history records checks on individuals applying to become members of NARAB that is inconsistent with the normal process the FBI uses to conduct thousands of such background checks.  The Administration believes the bill can be made consistent with current law in order to assure the benefits of an efficient and effective established process.  In addition, the Administration has constitutional concerns with the requirement that the President reserve eight of the thirteen positions on the NARAB Board of Directors for State insurance commissioners, which appears to significantly constrict the pool of individuals from which the President would  be able to make those eight nominations.  This restriction appears to impermissibly limit the scope of the President's appointment power.  The Administration recommends that this requirement be amended to expand the size of the pool of potential appointees.    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2231.  The bill would undermine the targeted, science-based, and regionally-tailored offshore development strategy that the American people and the States have helped develop.  The Administration is committed to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas development as part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy to increase domestic production and reduce dependence on foreign oil.  Since the President took office, America's dependence on foreign oil has decreased every year, and domestic oil and natural gas production has risen every year.  In 2012, American oil production reached the highest level in two decades and natural gas production reached an all-time high.    The Administration's current five-year strategy for offshore oil and gas leasing makes all of the highest resource areas on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), including frontier areas in the Alaskan Arctic, available for exploration and development.  Together, these areas contain more than 75 percent of the estimated, technically recoverable oil and gas resources in our oceans.  This plan was developed following extensive input from the public, industry, States, Tribes, and others, and incorporates lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  H.R. 2231 would require the Department of the Interior to open a number of new areas on the OCS. This action would be directed without Secretarial discretion to determine whether those areas are appropriate for leasing through balanced consideration of factors such as resource potential, State and local views and concerns, and the maturity of infrastructure needed to support oil and gas development, including response capabilities in the event of an oil spill.  The bill would mandate OCS lease sales along the east and west coast and elsewhere with inadequate consideration of military use conflicts and without regard for significant issues, such as State and local concerns and impacts on important commercial and recreational fisheries.   The bill also would establish unworkable deadlines and substantive and procedural limitations on important environmental review, alternatives and mitigation considerations, and other analysis that is critical to complying with laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Clean Water Act.  Full compliance with these laws is important for the protection of citizens, communities, and the environment, and is necessary in order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation.  The Administration is committed to ensuring that American taxpayers receive a fair return from the sale of public resources.  As drafted, the revenue sharing provisions of H.R. 2231 would ultimately reduce the net return to taxpayers from development of the Federal resources directed to be leased under the bill.  Consistent with the President's Budget, the Administration looks forward to working  with the Congress to improve the return to taxpayers from Federal energy development through royalty reforms, incentives to diligent development of oil and gas leases, and improvements to revenue collection processes not found in H.R. 2231.    Finally, while the Administration supports the statutory codification of the Administration's reorganization of the former Minerals Management Service, the Administration does not support the structure, requirements or naming conventions proposed in H.R. 2231, which are duplicative, ineffective and result in undue expense.

H.R. 1105 represents a step backwards from the progress made to date, given that private equity fund advisers have been filing reports with the SEC for over a year.  The bill\u2019s passage would deny investors access to important information intended to increase transparency and accountability and to minimize conflicts of interest.  Moreover, H.R. 1105 would exempt private equity funds from the disclosure requirements that the Congress laid out in Wall Street Reform to allow regulators to assess potential systemic risks.  Private equity funds are already subject to less stringent reporting requirements compared to other types of private funds and to an annual, rather than quarterly, filing requirement.  In addition, private fund advisers with under $150 million in assets under management are exempted from registration and subject only to recordkeeping and reporting requirements.   If the President were presented with H.R. 1105, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.J. Res. 70, H.J. Res. 71, H.J. Res. 72, H.J. Res. 73, and H.R. 3230, making fiscal year 2014 appropriations for very limited activities.  Consideration of appropriations bills in a piecemeal fashion is not a serious or responsible way to run the United States Government.  Instead of opening up a few Government functions, the House of Representatives should re-open all of the Government.  The harmful impacts of a shutdown extend across Government, affecting services that are critical to small businesses, women, children, seniors, and others across the Nation.  The Senate acted in a responsible manner on a short-term funding measure to maintain Government functions and avoid a damaging Government shutdown.  The House of Representatives should allow a straight up or down vote on the Senate-passed H.J. Res. 59.  If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 70, H.J. Res. 71, H.J. Res. 72, H.J.

The President's Budget includes a number of proposals that would enhance and simplify charitable giving incentives for many individuals.  However, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4719, which would permanently extend three current provisions that offer enhanced tax breaks for certain donations and add another two similar provisions without offsetting the cost.  If this same, unprecedented approach of making certain traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits over the next ten years, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.  Just two months ago, House Republicans themselves passed a budget resolution that required offsetting any tax extenders that were made permanent with other revenue measures.    As with other similar proposals, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the deficit to continue and create tax breaks that primarily benefit higher-income individuals, while insisting on offsetting the proposed extension of emergency unemployment benefits and the discretionary funding increases for defense and non-defense priorities such as research and development in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.  House Republicans also are making clear their priorities by rushing to make these tax cuts permanent without offsets even as the House Republican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 26 million working families and students by letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and education tax credits expire.    The Administration wants to work with Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen America\u2019s social sector.  However, H.R. 4719 represents the wrong approach.

The Administration appreciates the bipartisan effort to include full-year appropriations legislation for most Government functions that allows for planning and provides certainty, while making progress toward appropriately investing in economic growth and opportunity, and adequately funding national security requirements.  The Administration also appreciates the authorities and funding provided to enhance the U.S. Government's response to the Ebola epidemic, and to implement the Administration's strategy to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, as well as investments for the President's early education agenda, Pell Grants, the bipartisan, Manufacturing Institutes initiative, and extension of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. However, the Administration objects to the inclusion of ideological and special interest riders in the House bill. In particular, the Administration is opposed to the inclusion of a rider that would amend the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and weaken a critical component of financial system reform aimed at reducing taxpayer risk.  Additionally, the Administration is opposed to inclusion of a rider that would amend the Federal Election Campaign Act to allow individual donors to contribute to national political party committee accounts for conventions, buildings and recounts in amounts that are dramatically higher than what the law currently permits. Furthermore, the Administration is disappointed that the bill would fund the Department of Homeland Security through February 27, 2015, at last year's levels.  Short-term continuing resolution funding measures are disruptive, create uncertainty, and impede efficient resource planning and execution. The Administration urges the Congress to enact comprehensive full-year appropriations legislation for all Government functions free of provisions that have no place in annual appropriations bills. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3223, the Federal Employee Retroactive Pay Fairness Act.

Federal workers keep the Nation safe and secure and provide vital services that support the economic security of American families.  The Administration appreciates that the Congress is acting promptly to move this bipartisan legislation and looks forward to the bill's swift passage.    This bill alone, however, will not address the serious consequences of the funding lapse, nor will a piecemeal approach to appropriations bills.  The House of Representatives should allow a straight up or down vote on Senate-passed H.J.

The bill drastically underfunds critical investments that: develop American energy sources to build a clean and secure energy future; develop and commercialize the emerging technologies that create high-quality jobs and enhance the Nation's economic competiveness; and improve resilience against current and ongoing climate impacts that threaten our economy, public health, and natural resources.  The bill would leave U.S. competitiveness at risk in new markets for clean energy industries such as advanced vehicles, advanced manufacturing, energy efficiency for homes and businesses, and domestic renewable energy such as wind, solar, and biomass.  Furthermore, the legislation would cut essential national security efforts required to implement the President's nuclear strategy and advance counter-proliferation objectives.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2609, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  In addition, enacting H.R. 2609, while adhering to the overall spending limits in the House Budget's topline discretionary level for fiscal year (FY) 2014, would hurt our economy and require draconian cuts to middle-class priorities.  These cuts could result in hundreds of thousands of low-income children losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of children with disabilities losing Federal funding for their special education teachers and aides, thousands of Federal agents who can't enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend fugitives, and thousands of scientists without medical grants, which would slow research that could lead to new treatments and cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, and hurt America's economic competitiveness.   Almost three months have passed since the deadline for action and the Congress has yet to appoint conferees and agree on a budget resolution.  Prior to consideration of appropriations bills the Congress should complete an appropriate framework for all the appropriations bills that supports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national security for our economy to compete in the future.  As such, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2609 and any other legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.       Department of Energy (DOE)  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided for EERE activities.  The Committee bill proposes $746 million for EERE, which is $2.0 billion, or 73 percent, below the FY 2014 Budget request and would be the lowest enacted level of funding in real terms for EERE in the history of the Department.  Funding reductions are disproportionately taken in EERE, dramatically cutting the current level of critical Federal investments in innovative clean energy research and development at a time of significant global competition and progress.  The Committee bill would significantly reduce renewable electricity programs, derailing domestic efforts to build on past U.S. success in doubling the renewable energy generated from wind and solar sources.  Reducing building efficiency funding by more than two-thirds would hinder development of cost-effective new technologies and appliance standards to save Americans money by increasing energy productivity.  Insufficient levels of weatherization assistance funding would not sustain the full network of State and local offices needed to assist the Nation's low-income households in reducing their energy bills.  The Committee bill also severely reduces the necessary activities to ensure proper oversight and stewardship of investments in hundreds of existing grants and contracts.   Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided for ARPA-E.  The Committee bill would reduce ARPA-E by 87 percent compared to the FY 2014 Budget request.  The funding reductions would severely impact the ability of ARPA-E to fund high impact, potentially transformative energy research that aims to entirely change the way the Nation generates, stores, and uses energy.   Office of Science.  The Administration strongly opposes funding reductions to the Office of Science, which would reduce funding to below FY 2009 levels.  The proposed reductions would eliminate all funding for new grants and likely lead to terminations of ongoing awards.  At this level, operations at all major scientific user facilities would be reduced or would cease, affecting some 25,000 researchers.  Ongoing construction activities aimed at new facilities will be delayed or slowed, increasing overall long-run costs.  These reductions could severely impact U.S. leadership in many areas of science, including x-ray light sources and foundational research that will benefit clean energy production and use.    Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE).  The Committee bill combines EERE and OE into a single account with significantly reduced funding.  The Administration opposes the level of funding provided for OE activities, which at $80 million is less than half the FY 2014 Budget request.  These reductions to investments in Smart Grid research and development, Clean Energy Transmission and Reliability, and other activities, in conjunction with the lack of funding for an Electricity Systems Energy Innovation Hub, would significantly slow efforts to modernize and secure the electricity delivery grid and understand and respond to energy emergencies.   Race to the Top for Energy Efficiency and Grid Modernization.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the funding requested in the FY 2014 Budget for Race to the Top for Energy Efficiency and Grid Modernization, which would support State governments that implement effective policies and regulatory changes to cut energy waste, increase energy efficiency, and modernize the grid.  This one-time funding would help achieve the goal of doubling American energy productivity by 2030.   2  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The Administration strongly objects to the reduction to Naval Reactors, which would limit the NNSA Administrator's ability to address current and emerging issues in the fleet, reduce the throughput to qualify nuclear operators by 21 percent, and risk meeting regulatory requirements.  The Committee bill delays the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project, potentially jeopardizing the operational availability of aircraft carriers and submarines while increasing the project's cost by $335 million.  Furthermore, the Administration objects to the $335 million reduction, including rescissions, to Weapons Activities.  This reduction would weaken facility operations, construction initiatives, and stockpile support activities, all of which directly support the President's nuclear strategy as expressed in the Nuclear Posture Review.  The reduction would significantly increase the risk of schedule delays for these key components of the Administration's nuclear strategy.  It would also undercut the ability to maintain the nuclear stockpile by delaying the modernization of the Nation's plutonium manufacturing capability.    Yucca Mountain.  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's direction to fund the Yucca Mountain geological repository project.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee has failed to embrace the practical solutions proposed in the President's Nuclear Waste Strategy that were based on the concepts put forward by the non-partisan Blue Ribbon Commission.  This priority in the FY 2014 Budget is comprised of important elements for a successful waste program, such as consent-based siting, interim storage of waste, and program funding reforms that are essential to the success of a Nuclear Waste Program.    Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program.  The Administration strongly opposes the $22 million administrative expenses funding level provided for Title XVII programs, which would severely undermine DOE's ability to monitor the existing portfolio and diminish the quality of due diligence on new projects.  Because the Committee bill fails to provide sufficient capacity to effectively originate and monitor direct loans and loan guarantees, the bill significantly increases the risk of failed loans and guarantees that will lead to future costs to the Federal Government in the form of permanent indefinite authority under the Federal Credit Reform Act.    Statutory by Reference Provision.  The Administration urges the Congress to remove section 301(d) of the bill, which incorporates the text as well as the specific funding directions of the Committee bill report into the statute by reference.  Enactment of this provision would limit flexibility of the Department to manage programs and projects efficiently.    Weatherization Assistance Program.  Section 307 of the bill seeks to permanently block existing Weatherization Assistance Program authorizations, reducing the efficiency of the program by lowering the maximum income level for retrofit assistance eligibility, the maximum financial assistance per weatherized home, and the maximum allocation allowed for Training and Technical Assistance from current levels.  Corps of Engineers (Corps) Overall Funding.  The Committee bill provides nearly $4.68 billion for the Corps civil works program, $50 million less than requested in the FY 2014 Budget.  Within this total, the Administration urges the Congress to allow the Corps to begin work on select new starts proposed in the Budget.  These include a proposed study to evaluate flood risks across the Nation and a programmatic effort to create a more robust civil works infrastructure in light of increased 3  risk of extreme weather, and to provide for the requested $7 million increase for the Corps regulatory program.   Inland Waterways.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued strong support of cost-sharing of inland waterways capital investments, and the inclusion of the language proposed in the Budget to increase the total authorized cost for the Olmsted Locks and Dam project.   Clean Water Act.  Sections 107 and 112 of the bill would prevent the use of funds to address known deficiencies and regulatory uncertainties related to Clean Water Act regulations in order to protect important aquatic resources while supporting economic development.    Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project  Overall Funding.  The Committee bill provides $911 million for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project, $85 million below the FY 2014 Budget request.  The Administration urges the Congress to increase funding for the Bureau of Reclamation to the level requested and to allocate funding to priority conservation, science, and technology programs.    Central Utah Project (CUP).  The Administration urges the Congress to consolidate CUP into the Bureau of Reclamation as requested in the FY 2014 Budget.  The consolidation would simplify many administrative, budgeting, and reporting tasks while not adversely affecting project performance.  San Joaquin River Restoration.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's elimination of funding for this program, which would undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts.    Civilian Pay Raise  The Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for Federal civilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  4  ", "The Administration appreciates the efforts by Members of the House to improve previous coal combustion residual management bills.  However, the Administration has concerns with H.R. 2218 that need to be addressed for the legislation to adequately protect public health and the environment.  To ensure that H.R. 2218 provides for the safe management and disposal of coal ash, important gaps should be filled, including:  (1) authority to address inactive or abandoned disposal sites and for areas where coal ash is used in large scale fill operations; (2) clear and appropriate authority for taking potential corrective action on unlined or leaking impoundments or units; (3) groundwater protection standards that address the constituents of coal combustion residuals identified in H.R. 2218; and (4) clear minimum standards for EPA to identify and remedy State program deficiencies.  Additionally, the Administration is concerned that overly broad preemption language in the bill may unintentionally block important protections under the Clean Water Act.  The 2008 failure of a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, which spilled more than five million cubic yards of coal ash and will require $1.2 billion for clean-up, was a stark reminder of the need for safe disposal and management of coal ash.     The Administration would like to work with Congress to address the important issues with H.R. 2218 to allow for development, implementation, and enforcement of appropriate standards for facilities managing coal combustion residuals, while encouraging the beneficial use of this economically important material.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration does not support specifying timber harvest levels in statute, which does not take into account public input, environmental analyses, multiple use management or ecosystem changes.  The bill would create a fiduciary responsibility to beneficiary counties to manage FRRAs to satisfy the annual volume requirement, which may create significant financial liability for the United States.  It would also impede National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance for projects within FRRA, which undermines the reasoned consideration of the environmental effects of Federal agency actions.  The bill also would establish significant barriers to the courts by imposing a requirement that plaintiffs post a bond for the Federal government\u2019s costs, expenses, and attorneys\u2019 fees.    Title II would give States the ability to determine management on Federal lands, including prioritized management treatments for hazardous fuel reductions and forest health projects without consultation with Federal land agencies, public involvement, or consideration of sound science and management options.  The title would also accelerate commercial grazing and timber harvests without appropriate environmental review and public involvement, and would impede compliance with NEPA and Endangered Species Act (ESA) requirements.  The Administration supports early public participation in Federal land management.  The bill would mandate processes that shortchange collaboration and would lead to more conflict and delay.  Further, this title\u2019s mandated use of limited budgetary resources would likely reduce funding for other critical projects.  Title III would transfer from Federal agencies to a State-appointed Trust, the rights and  responsibilities to manage most lands covered by the Oregon and California Railroad and Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant Lands Act (O&C) lands, and attempts to create exemptions from NEPA, ESA and other land management statutes.  This would undermine appropriate management and stewardship of these lands, which belong to all Americans, would compromises habitat for threatened and endangered species, and would create legal uncertainty over management of these lands as well as increase litigation risk.   Further, Title III also contains seriously objectionable limitations on the President\u2019s existing authority under the Antiquities Act to designate new National Monuments in this region.  Title IV would remove authority from the Secretary of Agriculture for management of National Forest lands designated as Community Forest Demonstration Areas, while requiring the Secretary to be responsible for a number of management actions including fire presuppression, suppression, and rehabilitation.  This title\u2019s proposed management strategies would create a patchwork of management schemes and difficulties for the agency to meet other statutory and regulatory requirements.  Federal environmental laws should apply on Federal lands; however, Title IV creates exceptions to, and potentially exemptions from the normal application of these laws, including the Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and the ESA.  If H.R. 1526 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2223, the Minimum Wage Fairness Act.  This legislation would gradually raise the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 per hour, and its effects would benefit more than 28 million hardworking Americans nationwide, the majority of whom are women.   No American who works full-time should live in poverty, yet a full-time worker making minimum wage only earns $14,500 a year.  Furthermore, the Federal minimum wage has not kept pace with the rising costs of basic necessities for working families and today is worth about 20 percent less than it was in the early 1980s.  In addition, because S. 2223 not only raises the Federal minimum wage but also indexes it to inflation and increases the tipped minimum wage, the legislation would ensure that minimum wage workers' pay keeps up with increased costs.  Increasing the minimum wage not only helps earners, but also results in many businesses benefitting from increased worker productivity and reduced turnover.  And a higher minimum wage can help boost the economy because studies show workers spend the extra dollars they earn at businesses in their communities.   Historically, Republicans and Democrats have worked together to raise the minimum wage.  The Congress should act immediately to pass this legislation to reward hard work.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this and other measures to continue to build real, lasting economic security for the middle class and create more opportunities for every hardworking American to get ahead.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration is firmly committed to strengthening the Nation\u2019s financial system through the implementation of key reforms to derivatives markets.  However, the Administration opposes passage of H.R. 1256, which would modify Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act puts in place a number of requirements that bring transparency to and enhance the stability of derivatives markets.  These reforms will collectively strengthen the weak and outdated regulatory regime that played a significant role in the crisis that caused devastating damage to the U.S. economy and the financial well-being of American families.  Regulators are making significant progress with a number of derivatives-related reforms.  As part of these efforts, regulators are already coordinating to address the issues raised in H.R. 1256, while taking into account the characteristics of the particular markets they regulate.  Given these ongoing coordination efforts, passage of this bill would be premature and disruptive to the current and ongoing implementation of the reforms.  The Administration believes regulators should be given the time necessary to complete their work.  The Administration consequently opposes passage of H.R. 1256, which would preempt ongoing work and slow the implementation of these vital reforms.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3826, which would undermine the public health protections of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and stop U.S. progress in cutting dangerous carbon pollution from power plants.  In 2009, EPA determined that Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pollution threatens Americans' health and welfare by leading to long-lasting climate changes that are already having a range of negative effects on human health and the environment.  Power plants account for roughly one-third of all domestic GHG emissions.  While the United States limits emissions of arsenic, mercury, and lead pollution from power plants, there are no national limits on power plant carbon pollution. As part of his Climate Action Plan, the President directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to work with States, utilities, and other stakeholders to develop standards to end the limitless dumping of carbon pollution from power plants.  H.R. 3826 would block those important efforts, threatening the health and safety of Americans.  H.R. 3826 would nullify proposed carbon pollution standards for future power plants, and arbitrarily restrict the available technologies that could be considered for any new standards.  This requirement would stifle progress in reducing carbon pollution by discouraging the adoption of currently available and effective technology, and would limit further development of cutting-edge clean energy technologies.  Finally, the bill could delay indefinitely reductions in carbon pollution from existing power plants by prohibiting forthcoming rules from taking effect until Congress passes legislation setting the effective date of the rules.  This would undermine regulatory certainty and prevent timely action on standards for the power sector -- the largest source of carbon pollution in the country.    Since it was enacted in 1970, and amended in 1977 and 1990, each time with strong bipartisan support, the CAA has improved the Nation's air quality and protected public health.  Over that same period of time, the economy has grown over 200 percent while emissions of key pollutants have decreased by more than 70 percent.  Forty years of clean air regulation has shown that a strong economy and strong environmental and public health protection go hand-in-hand.    The Administration stands ready to work with Congress to enact comprehensive legislation to achieve meaningful reductions in carbon pollution.  However, the President has made it clear that if Congress fails to act to protect future generations from the threat of climate change, his Administration will.    Because H.R. 3826 threatens the health and economic welfare of future generations by blocking important standards to reduce carbon pollution from the power sector, if the President is presented with H.R. 3826, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3865, which would prohibit the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from clarifying the standards that organizations must satisfy to qualify for tax-exempt status.  Under current law, organizations qualify as tax-exempt organizations \u201coperated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare\u201d if they are primarily engaged in promoting in some way the common good and general welfare of the people.  The relevant Treasury and IRS rules have been in place since 1959 and are broadly recognized as unclear.  The proposed legislation would prevent any revisions or clarifications to those rules.  Thus, it could prevent the IRS from administering the tax code more effectively and from providing greater clarity to organizations seeking tax-exempt status.  H.R. 3865 would prevent Treasury and the IRS from issuing, for one year from the date of enactment, any generally applicable guidance relating to the standards for tax-exemption under section 501(c)(4) as a social welfare organization.  In addition, H.R. 3865 would require the IRS to continue to use the standard and definitions in effect on January 1, 2010, to determine whether an organization qualifies for tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(4).  The lack of clarity of these standards has resulted in confusion and difficulty administering the Code, as well as delays in the processing of applications for tax-exempt status.  The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration and the National Taxpayer Advocate, among others, have recommended clarifying the current rules.  Consistent with these recommendations, Treasury and the IRS recently issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that provides guidance on the definition of candidate-related political activity for purposes of determining the \u201cprimary activity\u201d of a social welfare organization and solicits public comment on a number of related issues.  This NPRM is the first step in a standard rulemaking process intended to clarify the rules and to provide greater certainty for organizations seeking tax-exempt status.  The notice and comment process allows for all concerned parties to provide input and comments before any changes to the rules are effected.  Treasury and the IRS will carefully consider any and all such comments before issuing any further guidance, and they will follow standard agency rulemaking procedures.  For the reasons described above, the Administration strongly opposes the proposed legislation.

The Administration greatly appreciates the Senate's bipartisan efforts to enact a food, farm and jobs bill.  With authorization for farm and food related programs set to expire this year, it is critical that the Congress pass legislation that provides certainty for rural America and includes needed reforms and savings.  The new farm bill should promote rural development, preserve a farm safety net, maintain strong nutrition programs, encourage the development of local and regional markets, enhance conservation, honor our international trade commitments, including under the World Trade Organization, and advance agricultural research.  In light of the Nation's long-term fiscal challenge, the legislation should also contribute significantly to deficit reduction.  The President's Budget provides a strong safety net for farmers that protect agriculture from losses, while instituting needed risk-based reforms to reduce spending for some agricultural programs.  The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 makes meaningful progress toward supporting the Administration's goals.  Notable reforms include eliminating the direct payment system and tightening payment and eligibility requirements.  The Administration supports the Senate's efforts to consolidate and streamline conservation assistance, which will reduce administrative burdens on farmers and ranchers and improve environmental outcomes, and believes that crop insurance payments should be tied to the Nation's soil conservation and wetland protection goals.  The bill's funding for bioenergy programs will enhance our energy security while supporting innovation and growth in rural economies.    Consistent with the President's Budget, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve crop insurance and commodity program savings that are not contained in S. 954, while at the same time strengthening the farm safety net in times of need and supporting the next generation of farmers.  The Administration also strongly supports the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a cornerstone of our Nation's food assistance safety net, which is why it was not subject to cuts in the President's Budget.  SNAP helps families put food on the table, while also benefitting farm and rural economies.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3361, the USA FREEDOM Act.  The President called on Congress to enact important changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

The bill ensures our intelligence and law enforcement professionals have the authorities they need to protect the Nation, while further ensuring that individuals\u2019 privacy is appropriately protected when these authorities are employed.  Among other provisions, the bill prohibits bulk collection through the use of Section 215, FISA pen registers, and National Security Letters.  The President has called for a transition to end bulk collection under Section 215, and the Administration strongly supports this prohibition.  Overall, the bill\u2019s significant reforms would provide the public greater confidence in our programs and the checks and balances in the system.

Further, the bill would require the Secretary of the Army to issue project-related permits pursuant to the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and prohibit the EPA Administrator from restricting or disallowing any activities or uses of areas authorized by the bill.  H.R. 3 conflicts with longstanding Executive branch procedures regarding the authority of the President, the Secretaries of State, the Interior, and the Army, and the EPA Administrator.  In addition, the bill is unnecessary because the Department of State is working diligently to complete the permit decision process for the Keystone XL pipeline.  The bill prevents the thorough consideration of complex issues that could have serious security, safety, environmental, and other ramifications.    Because H.R. 3 seeks to circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether cross-border pipelines are in the national interest by removing the Presidential Permitting requirement for the Keystone XL pipeline project, if presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5078, which would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (COE) from finalizing specified draft regulations and guidance needed to clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act (CWA).  The agencies\u2019 rulemaking, grounded in science, is essential to ensure clean water for future generations and reduce regulatory uncertainty, and is responsive to calls for rulemaking from Congress, industry, and community stakeholders as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Clean water is vital for the success of the Nation\u2019s businesses, agriculture, energy development, and the health of our communities.  More than 115 million Americans get their drinking water from rivers, lakes, and reservoirs that are at risk of pollution from upstream sources.  The protection of wetlands is vital for hunting and fishing.  When Congress passed the CWA in 1972, to restore the Nation\u2019s waters, it recognized that to have healthy communities downstream, we need to protect the smaller streams and wetlands upstream.  Clarifying the scope of the CWA helps to protect clean water, safeguard public health, and strengthen the economy.  H.R. 5078 would derail current efforts to clarify the scope of the CWA, hamstring future regulatory efforts, and create significant ambiguity regarding existing regulations and guidance.  It would deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water.  In addition to vitiating the specified draft regulations and already withdrawn guidance, the bill would call into question \u201cany successor document\u201d or \u201csubstantially similar\u201d proposed rule or guidance, even if all stakeholders reached consensus.  If enacted, H.R. 5078 could also incite further litigation that would only magnify confusion and uncertainty among affected stakeholders.   Furthermore, H.R. 5078 would further delay any action to clarify the scope of the CWA for up to two years by requiring State and local governments to engage in further consultations even though they were engaged and consulted during the development of the proposed rule and they continue to be consulted as the agencies proceed with rulemaking.     In the end, H.R. 5078 would sow more confusion and invite more conflict at a time when our communities and businesses need clarity and certainty around clean water regulation.  Simply put, this bill is not an act of good government; rather, it would hinder the ongoing rulemaking process and the agencies\u2019 ability to respond to the public as well as two Supreme Court rulings.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5078, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2667 and H.R. 2668 because the bills, taken together, would cost millions of hard-working middle class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve.  Rather than attempting once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which the House has tried nearly 40 times, it's time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to get into the middle class.  The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care and has already improved many aspects of the Nation's health care system.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, tens of millions of Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to a pre-existing medical condition will now be covered.  The nearly one in two Americans under the age of 65 with            pre-existing medical conditions will have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they can't be dropped from their health plan or denied coverage because of those conditions. House passage of H.R. 2667 and H.R. 2668 will undermine this security for tens of millions of Americans with        pre-existing conditions.  H.R. 2667 is unnecessary, and H.R. 2668 would raise health insurance premiums and increase the number of uninsured Americans.  Enacting this legislation would undermine key elements of the health law, facilitating further efforts to repeal a law that is already helping millions of Americans stay on their parents' plans until age 26, millions more who are getting free preventive care that catches illness early on, and thousands of children with pre-existing conditions who are now covered.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2667 and H.R. 2668, he would veto them.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports the Senate substitute amendment, the High Technology Jobs Preservation Act, to H.R. 527, the Responsible Helium Administration and Stewardship Act.  The substitute amendment would prevent the October 7, 2013, termination of the Federal program for crude helium sale, storage, and delivery.  The impending abrupt shutdown of this program would cause a spike in helium prices that would harm many U.S. industries and disrupt national security programs.  Instead, the substitute amendment would provide for an orderly transition of the Federal Government out of the helium market.   The Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) operates the Federal Helium Program as a strategic natural resource.  This program supplies about 42 percent of U.S. crude helium and about 35 percent of the world\u2019s demand.  Helium is an essential resource for the aerospace industry, computer chip and optical fiber manufacturing, for medical uses including MRI magnet cooling, lung tissue visualization, heart catheterization methods, and medical lasers, and aluminum helium arc welding.  Helium is also used in national defense applications such as rocket engine testing and purging, surveillance devices, air-to-air missiles and scientific balloons.  Under current law, the Federal Helium Program is scheduled to end on October 7, 2013, absent a new Congressional authorization.  This legislation would provide the BLM with the authority necessary to continue this critical program.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration believes Americans\u2019 personally-identifiable information should be protected wherever it resides, and that all Americans deserve to know if that information has been improperly exposed. Accordingly, the Federal Government adheres to extensive requirements for safeguarding against and responding to the breach of personally-identifiable information.  Additionally, the Administration called upon the Congress in May 2011 to pass national data breach legislation reflecting a real solution to this complex issue.  The Federal Government has already put in place an effective and efficient system for securing personally-identifiable information in the Health Insurance Marketplaces and providing consumers notification if their personally-identifiable information has been compromised. When consumers fill out their online Marketplace applications, they can trust that the information that they are providing is protected by stringent security standards.   The components of the HealthCare.gov website that are now operational comply with Federal security standards.  Security testing is conducted on an ongoing basis using industry best practices designed to appropriately safeguard consumers\u2019 personal information.   The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3811 because it would create unrealistic and costly paperwork requirements that do not improve the safety or security of personally-identifiable information in the Health Insurance Marketplaces.  For example, the indiscriminate reporting requirement in H.R. 3811 may seriously impede the law enforcement investigation of a breach.  Unlike existing requirements, H.R. 3811 requires expensive and unnecessary notification for the compromise of publicly-available information, even if there is no reasonable risk that information could be used to cause harm.   The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care and has already improved many aspects of the Nation's health care system.  Beginning this year, millions of low- and middle-income Americans will be eligible to receive tax credits to help them purchase insurance and cost-sharing reductions to help with out-of-pocket expenses for coverage.  Tens of millions of Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions will now be covered.  The nearly one in two Americans under the age of 65 with pre-existing medical conditions will have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they cannot be dropped from their health plan or denied coverage because of those conditions.  The Affordable Care Act is also bringing down the cost of health care for millions of families and businesses and will also reduce the Federal budget deficit.   H.R. 3811 would impose an administratively burdensome reporting requirement that is less effective than existing industry standards and those already in place for Federal Agencies that possess such information.  As such, the Administration opposes its passage.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5, the Student Success Act.  The Administration believes that the Congress must act to reform the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), to support State efforts to adopt and implement State-developed standards that ensure every student graduates from high school prepared for college and a career; create a fairer, flexible, and focused accountability system; support effective teachers and leaders; and promote innovation in our public education system.  These principles are reflected in the flexibility that the Administration has offered to States with respect to the Federally-mandated, one-size-fits-all standards of NCLB.  States' overwhelming participation in ESEA flexibility indicates that they already are committed to moving toward this vision of comprehensive reform.    Instead, H.R. 5 would represent a significant step backwards in the effort to help our Nation's children and their families prepare for their futures.  Among other things, the bill would not support State efforts to hold students to standards that will prepare them for college and careers; would not support our international economic competitiveness; would virtually eliminate accountability for the growth and achievement of historically underserved populations; would fail to support meaningful improvement and reforms at the Nation's lowest-performing schools; would eliminate maintenance-of-effort requirements, which could reduce overall investment in public education; and would not reauthorize key Administration priorities, including effective initiatives like Race to the Top, Investing in Innovation, and Promise Neighborhoods.   It is important that ESEA reauthorization ensures that all students have access to a high-quality education.  The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress to strengthen our Nation's schools through a bipartisan reauthorization of ESEA.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2279 because it would make a number of problematic changes to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which could delay remediation of national priority cleanup projects with the most urgent human health and safety risks.  CERCLA's existing Federal/State partnership provisions have been the cornerstone in developing strategies to address the releases of hazardous substances and to remediate contaminated sites across the country.   H.R. 2279 would unnecessarily increase the potential for litigation between the Federal government and the States, negatively impacting the timeliness and number of cleanups.  Specifically, the bill would expand the waiver of sovereign immunity to all current or former Federal facilities as well as those listed on the National Priorities List, and would require Federal agencies to comply with State-imposed remediation requirements irrespective of land use plans, site ownership, or national funding prioritizations.  It also would allow a State to seek injunctive relief, civil penalties, and the imposition of sanctions for \"enforcement of any injunctive relief\" against the United States.  The Administration already works closely with the States to ensure that remedial goals for the protection of public health are met and that the States' preferences and requirements are taken into account.  Federal agencies often face significant challenges in attempting to carry out response actions due to lack of funding.  Thus, agencies have developed prioritization approaches to identify the highest risk sites for immediate action in a \"worst first\" approach to cleanup.  H.R. 2279 may impact this prioritization if Federal agencies face litigation and the imposition of civil penalties on lower risk sites, ultimately reducing the funds available for on-going and future remediation efforts.   In the context of CERCLA cleanups, the bill would allow States to impose restrictions on federally-owned lands that could interfere with current and future uses of those properties.  This would effectively allow States to control the land use of Federal sites, including Department of Defense installations, Department of Energy laboratories, and Federal land management agency properties, significantly impairing the use of those facilities for mission-specific functions and potentially disrupting land transfer negotiations.    The bill would disrupt on-going reform efforts being undertaken by Federal regulators to ensure the sufficiency of appropriate financial assurance requirements needed to cover the cleanup of hazardous substance releases.  The bill's requirements could result in significant site cleanup delays, endangering public health and the environment.  For the reasons stated above, the President's senior advisors would recommend he veto this bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 2655, which would limit the discretion of courts by requiring monetary sanctions for violations of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Rule 11 requires attorneys to certify that pleadings are not presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.  H.R. 2655 would change Rule 11 by requiring monetary sanctions (including court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees) for a Rule 11 violation and by eliminating the safe harbor that now allows attorneys to correct or withdraw a filing before Rule 11 proceedings commence.  The bill would circumvent the usual procedure for amending the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  While H.R. 2655 is intended to curb a perceived increase in frivolous litigation, the bill would actually increase litigation.  By creating an automatic financial incentive, and by removing the safe-harbor period, the proposed changes to Rule 11 could dramatically increase the number of sanctions motions, including those filed against Federal government attorneys, and correspondingly increase the risk of financial exposure for any conduct that might be considered a Rule 11 violation.  In short, H.R. 2655 would raise the amount and cost of civil litigation and provide more opportunity for unnecessary delay and harassment.  The Administration is particularly concerned that the new requirements could be used to target consumer and civil rights plaintiffs.  Consumer abuse and civil rights cases rely heavily on the discovery process to prove the merits of their claims.  In addition, civil rights cases often seek to challenge the law or to extend existing precedents.  The threat of mandatory sanctions for failure to withstand a Rule 11 challenge could chill meritorious claims by deterring worthy plaintiffs from challenging existing laws or seeking novel interpretations of them.  The bill is opposed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the principal policymaking body for the Judicial Branch charged with proposing amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure under the careful, deliberate process outlined in the Rules Enabling Act.  Congress has tasked the Judicial Conference to serve as the principal policymaking body for the Judicial Branch.  Congress has thus empowered the Federal judiciary to make its own procedural rules, retaining the right to review those rules and to accept, modify, or reject them.  H.R. 2655 is an attempt to amend the rules directly, over the objections of the Judicial Conference.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s continued support of our national defense and supports a number of the provisions in H.R. 4435, the Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015.  In particular, the Administration appreciates the support of the Committee for authorities that assist the warfighter in operating in unconventional and irregular warfare and countering unconventional threats, support capacity-building efforts with foreign military forces, and support on-going operations, as well as the Committee\u2019s support for programs that would improve the health and well-being of the force.    While there are a number of areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration has serious concerns with provisions that would constrain the ability of the Department of Defense (DOD) to align military capabilities and force structure with the President\u2019s defense strategy and to reduce unneeded costs.  As we face this time of uncertainty in both the fiscal and security environments, we must ensure that scarce resources are directed to the highest priorities that our military requires to keep the Nation safe and prepare for future threats.   In the Administration's view, the risk to the Nation will grow significantly should Congress not accept reforms proposed in the FY 2015 Budget.  The bill does not include meaningful compensation reforms and other cost saving measures, rejects many of the Department\u2019s proposed force structure changes, and restricts DOD\u2019s ability to manage its weapon systems and infrastructure.  In aggregate, the Committee\u2019s changes to the President\u2019s proposed defense program would eliminate more than $50 billion in savings over the next five years and force DOD to alter its recommended balance among capability, capacity, and readiness in order to retain unnecessary overhead and force structure.  The Committee\u2019s changes increase the risk to the Department\u2019s ability to implement the President\u2019s defense strategy, contributing to a military that will be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.  In addition, the bill\u2019s continuation of unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees held at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, undermines our national security.    If the bill presented to the President impedes the ability of the Administration to properly direct scarce resources for our military, or continues unwarranted restrictions regarding detainees, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend to the President that he veto the bill.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks  forward to reviewing a classified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns on classified programs.    Guantanamo Detainee Restrictions:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1032 and 1033, which would prohibit the use of funds for the construction or modification of any facility to house Guantanamo detainees in the United States and for the transfer of detainees to the United States.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior legislation and has reiterated his call to Congress to lift the restrictions.  As the President said in his State of the Union Address, \u201cthis needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\u201d  Operating the detention facility at Guantanamo weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners and emboldening violent extremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Section 1033 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances.    Compensation Reform:  To achieve a proper balance between DOD\u2019s obligation to provide competitive pay and benefits to service members and its responsibility to provide troops the finest training and equipment possible, it is imperative to slow the growth of basic pay and housing allowances, modernize military healthcare, and reform how commissaries operate.  The Administration strongly encourages members of Congress to support these reforms, which would save $2 billion in FY 2015 and $31 billion through FY 2019.  While the Administration looks forward to the recommendations of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission on long-term compensation, modernization, and retirement issues, delaying DOD's holistic package of proposed initial changes will only result in increased costs and risks to the force.    Restricting Army National Guard and Active Army Force Structure Changes:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1050, which would limit Army National Guard and Active Army force structure changes.  As DOD transitions out of a decade of war, military end strength and force structure changes are necessary to shape a force that is more agile and technologically superior and ready to respond to requirements.  These changes are necessary to allow DOD to make necessary investments in readiness, modernization, and training.  Limitations on Retirement of Weapon Systems:  The Administration strongly objects to provisions that would restrict the Department\u2019s ability to retire weapon systems and aircraft platforms in accordance with current strategic and operational plans.  These divestitures are critical and would free up funding for higher priority programs.  Specifically, the Administration strongly objects to sections 131, 132, and 1026, which are inconsistent with DOD\u2019s fiscal constraints and current priorities.  Section 132 would restrict DOD from obligating or expending funds to retire A-10 aircraft.  Divesting the A-10 will save over $4.2 billion through FY 2019.  The joint force will retain several multi-mission aircraft capable of performing the close air support mission.  The Administration also objects to the Committee authorizing Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for the continued operation of the A-10 fleet.  Longstanding criteria for OCO eligibility clearly exclude such uses.  2  Likewise, section 1026, which would restrict DOD from obligating or expending any FY 2015 funds for the retirement, preparation for retirement, inactivation, or storage of a cruiser or dock landing ship, is unaffordable over the long term.  Further, this language would limit the Navy\u2019s ability to implement a phased modernization program that would provide eleven modernized cruisers and three dock landing ships through the 2030\u2019s.  This provision also directs modernization of two cruisers in FY 2015, which does not provide the Navy sufficient time to appropriately plan and purchase the required long lead-time materials.  Finally, section 131 would prohibit the cancellation or modification of the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  DOD plans to replace the C-130 AMP with a less expensive, fully capable alternative that has been validated by independent study to ensure that the fleet continues to meet future requirements.  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC):  The Administration strongly objects to section 2711, which would preclude any funds being authorized for use toward an additional BRAC round. This impairs the ability of the Executive Branch to plan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which would allow DOD to rightsize its infrastructure while providing important assistance to affected communities.  Without authorization for a new round of BRAC, DOD may not properly align the military\u2019s infrastructure with the needs of our evolving force structure, which is critical to ensuring that limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security.    National Guard Civil and Defense Support:  The Administration strongly objects to section 513, which would authorize Governors and Adjutants General of the various States to expend DOD funds to employ the National Guard of their States to perform support operations, missions, or activities in support of a civil authority of a State or Federal agency.  This unwarranted intrusion on the authorities of the President and the Secretary of Defense would impose significant fiscal burdens on an already shrinking Defense budget in order to fund non-Defense missions, would expose DOD to legal and fiscal risks for missions not under its control, and would circumvent the national response system.   Limitation on Use of Funds with Respect to Certification of Certain Flights by the Russian Federation under the Treaty on Open Skies:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1222, which would place limitations on the use of funds for the United States to exercise its rights under the treaty to authorize or permit a certification of new Russian aircraft or sensors used for Open Skies Treaty observation missions.  This limitation would infringe on the ability of the United States to implement its rights and obligations under the Treaty.  A prohibition on U.S. participation in certification procedures would prevent the United States from reviewing, examining, or raising concerns regarding a proposed Russian aircraft or sensor, but would have no bearing on the right of other States Parties to certify a Russian aircraft and its sensors, which would be permitted to fly in observation missions over the territories of all States Parties, including the United States.     Retention of Missile Silos:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1634, which would require the Secretary of Defense to preserve each intercontinental ballistic missile silo that contains a deployed missile as of the date of the enactment of this Act in at least a warm status.  This section would impinge on the President\u2019s authority to determine the appropriate force structure to meet nuclear deterrence requirements, to determine the number of strategic delivery 3  vehicles needed to meet national security requirements, and to implement changes in those forces.  While it is the President\u2019s determination that 50 of the current 450 Minuteman III silos will remain in a non-deployed\u2014warm\u2014status, this provision would tie the hands of all presidents with respect to force structure through February 5, 2021.  Moreover, as the Department currently plans to perform routine testing and maintenance on some silos, which would temporarily isolate them from the interconnected and redundant command and control system of the missile field during overhaul, the provision as drafted could prevent the Department from conducting this necessary testing and maintenance.   Missile Defense of Allies and Missile Defense Cooperation:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1641, which would require deployment of the Aegis Ashore site in Poland no later than 2016 and of short-range air and missile defense capability to Poland no later than December 2014.  Accelerating the deployment of the Aegis Ashore site by two years would impose large costs on, and risk to, other Navy programs and likely would not change Russia\u2019s security calculation in Europe.  Similarly, deploying short-range air and missile defense capability to Poland would limit the ability of the United States to meet its worldwide operational missile defense requirements.  The Administration also objects to sections 1223 and 1224, which would infringe on the President\u2019s ability to conduct foreign policy.  East Coast Missile Site Planning and Design:  The Administration strongly objects to the authorization in section 4601 of $20 million in FY 2015 for planning and design of an east coast missile field.  The authorization is premature and potentially wasteful.  Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) and Security Cooperation with Russia:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1303, which would prohibit the obligation or expenditure of FY 2015 funds for CTR activities in the Russian Federation until the Secretary of Defense makes certain certifications, and strongly objects to sections 3120 and 3121, which would place restrictions on the use of funds by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) for any contact, cooperation, or transfer of technology between the United States and the Russian Federation and on defense nuclear nonproliferation cooperation activities at certain Russian defense sites.  Nuclear security cooperation with the Russian Federation is in the U.S. national interest.  Cooperation with Russia remains an essential element to the global effort to address the threat posed by nuclear terrorism.  Critical bilateral nuclear nonproliferation activities are continuing in a number of key areas, and nuclear security is of paramount importance.  The blanket restriction on the use of funds for \u201ccontact\u201d or \u201ccooperation\u201d between the United States and the Russian Federation unconstitutionally interferes with the President\u2019s constitutional authority to conduct diplomacy.  The Administration similarly objects to section 1221, which would limit the use of funds for military contact and cooperation between the United States and Russian Federation unless Russia fully complies with its obligations under the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty, and withdraws its forces from Ukraine, or certain certifications are made.  In addition, section 1225, among other things, purports to make a definitive finding that the Russian Federation is in material breach of its obligations under the INF Treaty and requires the President to report to Congress on whether the United States should remain a party to the INF Treaty and other international agreements.  These provisions would hamper the President\u2019s ability to execute foreign policy.   Iran Nuclear Negotiations:  The Administration has concerns with the Sense of Congress language on Iran in section 1264 or similar provisions purporting to set conditions on 4  negotiations.  Preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon has been a top priority for the Administration toward which it has worked diligently with Congress and our international partners.  The Administration appreciates Congress\u2019 important contributions to strengthening sanctions, which assisted in our ability to conclude a Joint Plan of Action and to pursue negotiations on a comprehensive solution.  The International Atomic Energy Agency has assessed that under the Joint Plan of Action, Iran has taken specific and verifiable actions that have halted the progress of Iran\u2019s nuclear program and rolled it back in key respects.  The ongoing P5+1 negotiations are the best opportunity to peacefully achieve the goal of preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.  By spelling out conditions for a final resolution before the conclusion of the negotiations, the bill undermines that vital effort.  The Administration is fully committed to continuing to brief and consult closely with Congress so that the U.S. Government speaks with one voice and does not undermine our negotiators\u2019 efforts to achieve a strong deal that will protect our interests, our partners, and the international community.    Alternative Fuels:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 314, 315, 316, and 317, which would impede DOD\u2019s use of alternative fuels.  Sections 316 and 317 would inhibit development of a diverse, cost-competitive energy supply that enhances American energy security.  A diverse approach to energy security -- one that includes both conventional and new sources -- will provide an enduring benefit for our economy and military capabilities.  Section 315 would be burdensome and impractical to implement.  DOD has made and will continue to make alternative fuels a regular and ongoing part of its logistics and operations. As refined products, alternative fuels are indistinguishable from conventional fuels.  Section 314, which would exempt DOD from section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, undercuts a law passed with strong bipartisan support that provides an environmentally sound framework for the development of future alternative fuels.   DOD Management:  The Administration objects to section 903, which would establish the position of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment (ASD(I&E)).  While this section would eliminate the discretionary position of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment (DUSD(I&E)), as required by law, it would increase the number of statutorily prescribed ASDs when DOD is working to streamline headquarters structure and reduce spending.  The Administration also believes that its proposal to merge DUSD(I&E) and ASD(Operational Energy Plans and Program), and re-designate the office as the ASD for Installations, Energy, and Environment, would build synergies between installations, environment, and energy functions and activities.  The Administration also objects to section 907, which would reverse the Secretary of Defense\u2019s November 2013 decision to reorganize the Office of Net Assessment.    Resubmission of 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR):  The Administration objects to section 1078, which would require DOD to resubmit a report on the QDR that was released to Congress in March 2014.  Given the broad scope of the 2014 QDR, resubmitting a report absent greater certainty about the future fiscal and security environment would yield a similar result and would not be a prudent use of DOD resources.   Operation and Maintenance Reductions:  The Administration objects to the $1.4 billion reduction of unobligated balances and the $817.5 million reduction for contract services.  The unobligated balances and contract services reductions will be applied to the same readiness programs that the Congress is increasing.  Contract services fund critical readiness and depot maintenance 5  programs, but also provide support for congressional special interest items, such as tuition assistance, facilities maintenance, audit readiness, ROTC and military family programs, as well as sexual assault and suicide prevention.  Assessment and Limitation on Availability of Funds for Intelligence Activities and Programs of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and Special Operations Forces (SOF):  The Administration objects to section 1611, which would limit the availability of 50 percent of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for FY 2015 of USSOCOM Major Force Program-11 procurement, defense-wide, and research, development, testing, and evaluation, defense-wide, until the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress an assessment of the intelligence activities and programs of the SOF and USSOCOM.  DOD does not object to conducting such an assessment, but the hold on funding would disrupt investment in critical future counterterrorism capabilities.  This restriction would require delaying or canceling procurement and development of critical counterterrorism capabilities designed to support SOF operators in the field in a timely manner.  Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH) of the U.S.S. George Washington (CVN 73):  The Administration has concerns with the authorization to begin the RCOH of CVN 73 and section 1024, which limits the obligation and expenditure of funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, until funds are obligated for the planning of the RCOH of CVN 73.  Without assurance that sequestration will be addressed and that future budget levels will be sufficient to ensure that CVN 73 can be adequately operated, maintained, crewed, and sustained in a balanced force structure that includes 11 carriers and 10 air wings, it would be unwise to fund efforts to conduct the RCOH in FY 2015, only to be forced to cancel it and inactivate CVN 73 in FY 2016 due to ongoing budget restrictions.    Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike System (UCLASS):  The Administration objects to section 213, which would restrict all funding for the UCLASS Program pending an additional requirements review, and to an authorization reduction in the bill of $203 million.  These reductions would increase total program cost and jeopardize the program\u2019s continued viability.   Littoral Combat Ship (LCS):  The Administration objects to funding reductions for the LCS.  The cuts leave the program with insufficient funds to procure three LCS in FY 2015, delaying the delivery of much needed capability to the Fleet.  Deferring additional ships into FY 2016 would compound the already significant challenges the Navy faces in funding the shipbuilding account in a fiscally constrained environment while increasing overall costs to the Navy and increasing risk to the industrial base, including sub-tier suppliers.  Prohibition on Implementing Military Health System Modernization Study:  The Administration objects to section 714.  The timelines imposed by the reporting requirements, along with the mandatory 120-day waiting period, would significantly delay the implementation of improvements identified in the Military Health System Modernization Study.  This delay would adversely affect medical readiness and clinical proficiency to the detriment of our military members and their families.  Directors and Deputy Directors of the Army and Air National Guard:  The Administration objects to section 512, which would alter the selection process for leadership of the Army and 6  Air National Guards by allowing the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to recommend General Officers to serve in those positions.  Although these recommendations would have to be made in consultation with the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force, these National Guard positions are charged with representing their respective services and are critical to the ability of the Service Secretaries concerned to execute their statutory responsibilities.  Additionally, to ensure the appropriate civilian control of the military, the Service Secretaries should retain the current authority to recommend officers for appointment to these positions.  Military Land Withdrawals:  The Administration has concerns with various provisions relating to military land withdrawals and transfers with respect to various military installations.  While the current system of periodic legislative re-withdrawals is not particularly efficient and does not provide for the optimum land management regime, the Administration is not prepared to support transfers of such lands without careful consideration of the supporting legislative provisions.  The Administration stands ready to consider measures and approaches to make the use of public lands for military needs more efficient.  Reducing the Force Structure at Lajes Air Force Base:  The Administration objects to section 1048, which would prohibit the Secretary of the Air Force from reducing the force structure at Lajes Air Force Base.  It is duplicative of section 341 of the FY 2014 National Defense Authorization Act.  Because DOD is nearing completion of the section 341 requirements for Lajes, duplicating and amplifying these requirements is unnecessarily onerous.  While the provision overall is objectionable, the Administration notes that the Comptroller General language impermissibly vests in an agent of Congress the power to exercise policy-making control over the post-enactment decisions of executive officials.    Disposition of Weapons-Usable Plutonium:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3117, which would require the Secretary of Energy to continue construction of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility.  The Administration\u2019s plan to move the facility into cold stand-by in FY 2015 while it continues to explore more cost effective alternatives will save taxpayers billions of dollars while still maintaining the U.S. Government\u2019s commitment to disposing of unneeded plutonium.   Second Line of Defense (SLD) Funding Reduction:  The Administration strongly objects to the significant reduction of funds for SLD.  The Global Nuclear Detection Architecture integrates efforts across the U.S. Government to detect the movement of nuclear and radiological materials and the SLD program is a vital component of that architecture.  Abruptly removing SLD capabilities would result in gaps in our defenses that cannot be filled by any other program.  In addition, SLD implements key parts of the President's nuclear security agenda and is reflected in the Nuclear Security Summit process.  Recent information from the IAEA also demonstrates that the demand for the expertise and programs in which SLD is the global leader is increasing as more countries finalize their plans for developing peaceful nuclear technology. Plutonium Pit Production Capacity:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3114, which would require the Secretary of Energy to accelerate pit production rates ahead of requirements. The Administration is committed to meeting military requirements for plutonium pit production capacity as set by the Nuclear Weapons Council.  This directed increase is inconsistent with planned funding levels and would unnecessarily increase risk by requiring further trade-offs with other nuclear weapons programs.  The Administration believes the plan put forward in the FY 7  2015 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan represents the best balance of programs to maintain the deterrent and provide for a responsive infrastructure.  Prototypes of Nuclear Weapons for Intelligence Purposes:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3111, which would direct the national security laboratory directors to develop a multiyear plan and would require the Secretary of Energy to submit it to Congress without changes.  The Secretary of Energy should review and approve the multiyear plan.  Approval and publication of such a plan should be done by the government.  Production of Nuclear Warhead for Long-Range Standoff Weapon:  The Administration objects to section 3116, which would require accelerating the Long Range Stand Off program to achieve a first production unit by 2025.  Such an adjustment must be made through a deliberative process that takes into account the full set of military requirements.  Accelerating the program would require increased funding through FY 2019 and significant cuts in other programs.    Authorized NNSA Personnel Levels:  The Administration objects to section 3112, which would impose unduly restrictive limits on NNSA\u2019s ability to recruit, hire, retain, and reshape its workforce to meet its diverse missions by capping the staff at 1,650 full time employees.  The FY 2015 request funds an appropriate level of staffing and reflects significant efficiencies.  NNSA has achieved in federal staffing and support, including a staff reduction of 9.3 percent relative to FY 2012.  Defense Environmental Cleanup:  The Administration objects to section 3102, which would eliminate the authorization of appropriations for the contribution to the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund.  This funding is critical to the Administration\u2019s proposal to reauthorize the Fund to address the significant shortfall in resources allocated for cleanup of shutdown uranium enrichment plants that supported nuclear weapons production and commercial power generation.  DOE Nuclear Facilities Safety:  The Administration objects to section 3203, which would reduce the authorized personnel strength of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board from 150 to 120 full-time employees.  This provision would severely hamper the ability of the Board to provide external, independent oversight of DOE's defense nuclear facilities and compromise its core mission to protect workers and the public.  A number of the bill's provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, including with respect to the President\u2019s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.  * * * * * * *  8  ", "The Administration supports measures that enhance non-profits, philanthropic organizations, and faith-based and other community organizations in their many roles, including as a safety net for those most in need, an economic engine for job creation, a tool for environmental conservation that encourages land protections for current and future generations, and an incubator of innovation to foster solutions to some of the Nation\u2019s toughest challenges.  The President's Budget includes a number of proposals that would enhance and simplify charitable giving incentives for many individuals. However, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5806, which would permanently extend three current provisions that offer enhanced tax breaks for certain donations.  As the Administration stated when strongly opposing similar legislation this past July, if this same, unprecedented approach of making certain traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits over the next ten years, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.  Earlier this year, House Republicans themselves passed a budget resolution that required offsetting any tax extenders that were made permanent with other revenue measures. As with other similar proposals, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the deficit to continue tax breaks, while insisting on offsetting the proposed extension of emergency unemployment benefits and the discretionary funding increases for defense and non-defense priorities such as research and development in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.  House Republicans also are making clear their priorities by rushing to make these tax cuts permanent without offsets even as the House Republican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 26 million working families and students by letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and education tax credits expire. The Administration wants to work with the Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen America\u2019s charitable sector.  However, H.R. 5806 represents the wrong approach. If the President were presented with H.R. 5806, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 803, the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills (SKILLS) Act, as ordered reported by the House Education and the Workforce Committee.   This Nation should be doing everything it can to help people find a job or build their skills to advance in their careers or to seek a new one.  Additionally, it is imperative that employers have the skilled workforce they need.  The Administration is exploring opportunities to revisit how the Federal Government funds job training and employment services, including the possibility of reorganizing some existing programs that serve overlapping populations.  The Administration already has advanced proposals in this area through its Budgets, including a universal displaced worker program to provide those who lose their jobs with a single set of core services.   However, any effort to streamline the current system must allow for sufficient funding to meet the needs of workers and job-seekers, as well as adhere to certain core principles.  It must improve services; provide easy one-stop access to those services, including for vulnerable populations; reflect employer and regional economic needs; enhance accountability and transparency; and promote continuous innovation and improvement.   While H.R. 803 takes some positive steps, the bill does not adhere to the Administration's key principles for reform.  The bill would eliminate, or allow the consolidation of, many targeted programs, without providing the critical assistance needed by vulnerable populations such as veterans, low-income adults, youth, adults with literacy and English language needs, people with disabilities, ex-offenders, and others with significant barriers to employment.  H.R. 803 would freeze funding for the next seven years and would fail to support efforts to innovate and replicate effective approaches.    It is important to make sure that policies improve, rather than hinder, job access.  The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress on bipartisan legislation to improve the Nation's workforce investment system.    * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1947, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013.  The bill would reduce access to food assistance for struggling  families and their children, does not contain sufficient commodity and crop insurance reforms, and does not provide funding for  renewable energy, which is an important source of jobs and economic  growth in rural communities across the country.   The Administration strongly opposes the harmful cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program (SNAP), a cornerstone of our Nation's food assistance safety net.  The bill makes unacceptable deep cuts in SNAP, which could increase hunger among millions of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet, including families with children and senior citizens.  The  Administration believes that Congress should achieve significant budgetary savings to help reduce the deficit without creating hardship for vulnerable families \u2013  for example, by  reducing  crop insurance subsidies.  Rather than reducing crop insurance subsidies by  $11.7 billion over 10 years, as proposed in the  President\u2019s Budget, H.R. 1947 would increase reference prices for  farmers by  roughly 45 percent and increase already  generous crop insurance subsidies at a cost of nearly $9 billion  over 10 years  to the  Nation\u2019s taxpayers.   The Administration supports enactment of a multi-year Farm Bill that includes a long-term extension of disaster programs and promotes rural development, preserves a farm safety net, maintains strong nutrition  programs, encourages the development of local and regional markets, enhances conservation, supports environmental stewardship, complies with our World Trade  Organization commitments, advances agricultural research, and provides funding for  renewable energy.  In addition, the Administration believes that crop insurance payments should be tied to the Nation's soil conservation and wetland protection goals.  The legislation should also contribute significantly to deficit reduction, with savings from reforms proposed in the  President's Budget.   Consistent with the President's Budget, the Administration looks forward to working  with the  Congress to achieve  crop insurance  and commodity  program savings not contained in H.R. 1947, while at the same time strengthening the farm safety net in times of need and supporting the next generation of  farmers.  The Administration also looks forward to working  with the Congress to structure reporting  requirements to maximize and facilitate agricultural research without  creating  undue burdens.  The Administration believes that provisions that would create unneeded barriers for agencies with regulatory  responsibilities in executing their missions should not be included in a final bill.   Finally, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reform the P.L. 480 Title  II  food aid program in order to provide food aid to starving people faster and feed millions of additional people per year at current funding levels.    If the President were presented with H.R. 1947, his senior advisors would recommend that he  veto the bill.   * * * * * * *      2   ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 2775, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes.  The legislation represents a bipartisan agreement to reopen the Government and remove the threat of default that would harm middle-class families, American businesses, and the Nation's economic standing in the world.  The Administration urges the Congress to act swiftly to pass the bill in order to protect the full faith and credit of the United States and end the Government shutdown.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on fiscal year 2014 appropriations legislation for the full year.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 1243, making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other purposes.   The Senate passed a budget which provides a concrete plan to grow our economy, create good middle class jobs and shrink our deficits in a balanced way, consistent with the President's belief that our economy grows best from the middle-out, not the top-down, while reducing the debt as a share of the economy.  The Senate budget enables critical investments in education, infrastructure, innovation, and national security that support America's continued economic recovery and best positions Americans and our economy to compete in the future.          S. 1243 is consistent with the budget framework that passed the Senate and the President's Budget for FY 2014.  The bill makes important investments in transportation infrastructure that will help to fix America's crumbling roads and bridges and upgrade and modernize the infrastructure that is so vital to the Nation's economic security and long-term growth.  The bill also recognizes how important housing is to a sense of security for the American people.  This bill continues to provide critical housing assistance to America's families, supports economic development in local communities, and contributes to the Nation's ongoing housing recovery. The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.    Department of Transportation (DOT)   Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.  The Administration strongly supports the $550 million provided for TIGER Grants.  This competitive grant program is critical in helping communities around the country leverage their own resources to complete critical transportation projects.   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Operations.  The Administration supports the Committee's efforts to prioritize FAA Operations funding and provide funds at the requested level of $9.7 billion.  This funding level will allow the agency to hire to keep pace with attrition in its aviation safety and controller workforce.  FAA Facilities, Equipment, and NextGen.  The Administration strongly supports the Committee's commitment to maintain legacy facilities and equipment while also investing in modernization of the Nation's air traffic control system through NextGen.  The Senate Committee bill provides robust funding for the NextGen initiative.    National Railroad Passenger Corporations (Amtrak).  The Administration supports the Committee's commitment to provide funding for grants to passenger rail.  The Committee bill combines Amtrak operating and capital accounts into a single Amtrak grant program, allowing for increased flexibility to address emergent needs.  Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Capital Investment (New Starts) Grants.  The Administration supports the Committee's commitment to investment in new public transit in cities across the Nation.  By providing the requested level for Transit New Starts, the bill will enable FTA to fund all existing New Starts grant agreements for projects currently under construction as well as support for the new projects recommended in the Budget, including a Core Capacity program grant as authorized in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).  Pipeline Safety.  The Administration strongly supports the funding provided for the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration, which will allow for more pipeline safety inspectors and State grants to monitor and regulate the Nation's 2.6 million miles of privately owned and operated pipelines.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Core Rental Assistance.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for HUD's core rental assistance programs, which provide affordable rental housing for millions of low-income families.  The Administration urges the Congress to enact the full $20 billion request for the Housing Choice Voucher program in order to maximize assistance to families seeking decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private rental market.  Choice Neighborhoods.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for Choice Neighborhoods, and urges the Congress to provide the full $400 million request for this program.  Choice Neighborhoods provides critical support to revitalize distressed HUD-assisted housing and build ladders of opportunity for low-income families by improving economic development, creating jobs, and helping residents access educational opportunities in surrounding communities.   Homeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the President's request for Homeless Assistance Grants, which funds a variety of intervention programs that serve homeless and at-risk individuals and families, and urges Congress to provide the full $2.26 billion for these grants.  At this level, HUD would be able to serve at least 26,000 additional persons who are homeless and at-risk of homelessness.  Community Development Block Grants (CDBG).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for CDBG, including $75 million for Integrated Planning and Investment Grants.  This funding provides critical State and local resources for public improvements, infrastructure, affordable housing, and public services for low- to moderate-income families, and supports planning efforts to help localities strategically invest those resources to achieve the greatest benefit for citizens.  The Administration urges the Congress to also support the proposed Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative to provide targeted assistance to neighborhoods still feeling the effects of the foreclosure crisis.  HOME Investment Partnerships Program.  The Administration supports the level of funding provided for the HOME Program, which provides grants to State and local governments to increase the supply of affordable housing.  2  Housing Counseling.  The Administration strongly supports the Committee's full funding of counseling programs in HUD and the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation that assist families in challenging housing situations.  Civilian Pay Raise  The Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for Federal civilian employees.

Republicans have had more than a year to comprehensively fix the Nation's broken immigration system, but instead of working toward a real, lasting solution, Republicans released patchwork legislation that will only put more arbitrary and unrealistic demands on an already broken system.  H.R. 5230 could make the situation worse, not better.  By setting arbitrary timelines for the processing of cases, this bill could create backlogs that could ultimately shift resources away from priority public safety goals, like deporting known criminals.  This bill will undercut due process for vulnerable children which could result in their removal to life threatening situations in foreign countries.  In addition, the limited resources provided in H.R. 5230 are not designated as emergency, but rather come at the expense of other Government functions.  H.R. 5230 also fails to provide the necessary resources for the Department of Agriculture to address imminent wildfire suppression and rehabilitation needs without resorting to damaging transfers from other critical forest health and fire preparedness priorities.  It also does not include the bipartisan proposal for a discretionary cap adjustment to provide funding certainty in the future for these needs.    H.R. 5230 does not include funding for the Department of Defense to support the Government of Israel's request for critical missile defense needs.  H.R. 5230 also waives important environmental protections for National Parks, National Monuments, and other public lands within 100 miles of the border for Customs and Border Protection activities.

The Administration urges the Congress to pass sensible and responsible legislation to address these pressing needs.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports regulatory transparency, but strongly opposes H.R. 4012.  The bill would impose arbitrary, unnecessary, and expensive requirements that would seriously impede the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s) ability to use science to protect public health and the environment, as required under an array of environmental laws, while increasing uncertainty for businesses and States.     H.R. 4012 could be used to prevent EPA from finalizing regulations until legal challenges about the legitimate withholding of certain scientific and technical information are resolved.  The bill also could prevent EPA from making crucial decisions, including those concerning the cleanup of contaminated sites, if the data supporting those decisions cannot, for legitimate reasons, be made publicly available.  For example, some scientifically-important data is not made broadly available in order to protect the privacy of test subjects or Confidential Business Information, and H.R. 4012 could prevent EPA from taking actions based on protected data.  In short, the bill would undermine EPA\u2019s ability to protect the health of Americans, would impose expensive new mandates on EPA, and could impose substantial litigation costs on the Federal government.  It also could impede EPA\u2019s reliance on the best available science.   Instead of an overly broad bill that would tie EPA\u2019s hands, the Administration urges Congress to support the Administration\u2019s efforts to make scientific and technical information more accessible and regulations more transparent.  A bill consistent with the principles expressed in the Administration\u2019s Executive Order 13563 \u201cImproving Regulation and Regulatory Review\u201d and the December 2010 Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Memorandum on Scientific Integrity, as well as implementation of the Administration\u2019s recent open data and public access initiatives (e.g., OSTP\u2019s February 2013 policy memorandum on Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research) would greatly benefit the American people.

Implementation of the Agreement would establish a framework for the cooperative exploration and development of oil and gas reservoirs that cross the international maritime boundary between the two countries in the Gulf of Mexico and would make nearly 1.5 million acres of the Outer Continental Shelf, currently subject to a moratorium under the Western Gap Treaty, immediately available for leasing.    However, the Administration cannot support H.R. 1613, as reported by the House Committee on Natural Resources, because of other unnecessary, extraneous provisions that seriously detract from the bill.  Most significantly, the Administration strongly objects to exempting actions taken by public companies in accordance with transboundary hydrocarbon agreements from requirements under section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission's Natural Resource Extraction Disclosure Rule.  As a practical matter, this provision would waive the requirement for the disclosure of any payments made by resource extraction companies to the United States or foreign governments in accordance with a transboundary hydrocarbon agreement.  The provision directly and negatively impacts U.S. efforts to increase transparency and accountability, particularly in the oil, gas, and minerals sectors.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact implementing legislation that would focus on the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Agreement, without the inclusion of extraneous and unnecessary provisions.  The Department of the Interior estimates that the transboundary area subject to the Western Gap Treaty moratorium contains as much as 172 million barrels of oil and 304 billion cubic feet of natural gas.

After 2017, H.R. 4935 would effectively eliminate the Child Tax Credit for 5 million families, while cutting it for 6 million more.  A single parent with two children working full-time at minimum wage would lose her entire tax credit of $1,725.  Meanwhile, a couple with two children with income of $150,000 would receive a Child Tax Credit $2,200 larger than today.  In addition, H.R. 4935 would immediately eliminate the Child Tax Credit for millions of American children whose parents immigrated to this country, including U.S. citizen children and \u201cDreamers,\u201d and would push many of these children into or deeper into poverty.  The Administration strongly supports tax relief for working and middle-class families.  H.R. 4935, however, would raise taxes for millions of struggling working families while enacting expensive new tax cuts without offsetting their costs, reflecting fundamentally misplaced priorities.  If Republicans want to show they are serious about helping working families through the Child Tax Credit, they should start by extending current provisions past 2017.

H.R. 4315 would require several changes detrimental to the implementation of the ESA, which provides a critical safety net for America\u2019s native fish, wildlife, and plants and which has produced remarkable successes.  The ESA is implemented in a transparent, accessible, science-based, and flexible manner that encourages landowners and communities to work cooperatively to benefit endangered species and the public. Key ESA decisions are required to be based on the best available scientific and commercial data. H.R. 4315 would deem all data from a State, tribal, or county government to be \"best available\" without regard to the quality or merit of the data.  This would compromise the scientific basis for ESA decisions by requiring Federal agencies to consider information based on its source rather than its substance.  The bill would also require Federal agencies to publish on the internet all data used in ESA listing determinations.  Such a requirement would limit the amount and quality of information supporting ESA decisions by discouraging data sharing by scientists, State and local governments, and particularly private landowners, who do not want their information disclosed online.  This provision could also expose vulnerable wildlife and rare plants to increased poaching or vandalism.    In addition, H.R. 4315 would add yet another administratively burdensome reporting requirement to an already long list of reporting requirements, diverting limited agency resources away from species recovery efforts toward more paperwork.

Since 2008, growth in private health insurance spending stayed between three and four percent \u2013 significantly lower than earlier this decade when growth reached almost 12 percent.  With health care costs rising at such low rates, this bill would be a major step back.    H.R. 3350 rolls back the progress made by allowing insurers to continue to sell new plans that deploy practices such as not offering coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, charging women more than men, and continuing yearly caps on the amount of care that enrollees receive.  The Administration supports policies that allow people to keep the health plans that they have.  But, policies that reverse the progress made to extend quality, affordable coverage to millions of uninsured, hardworking, middle class families are not the solution.

However, H.R. 1062 would add onerous procedures that would threaten the implementation of key reforms related to financial stability and investor protection.  H.R. 1062 would direct the SEC to conduct time- and resource-intensive assessments after it adopts or amends major regulations before the impacts of the regulations may have occurred or be known.  The bill would add analytical requirements that could result in unnecessary delays in the rulemaking process, thereby undermining the ability of the SEC to effectively execute its statutory mandates.     The Administration is committed to a regulatory system that is informed by science, cost-justified, and consistent with economic growth.  Through efforts including Executive Order 13579, \"Regulation and Independent Regulatory Agencies,\" the Administration is taking important steps to encourage independent agencies to follow cost-saving and burden-reducing principles in their reviews of new regulations, and to examine their existing rules to identify those that should be modified, streamlined, or repealed.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1406. This legislation undermines the existing right to hard-earned overtime pay, on which many working families rely to make ends meet, while misrepresenting itself as a workplace flexibility measure that gives power to employees over their own schedules.  If the President were presented with this legislation in its current form, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  H.R. 1406 would not prevent employers from cutting the overtime hours and reducing the take-home pay of employees who currently have the right to overtime compensation.  The legislation does not provide sufficient protections for employees who may not want to receive compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay.   The proposed legislation also does not guarantee that workers will be able to use the time they have earned when they choose.  Instead, H.R. 1406 could be read to provide employers broad discretion to deny requests to use compensatory time off if it would unduly disrupt their operations.  Additionally, the bill fails to specify what remedy would be available to those employees who are denied their requests.    Finally, the bill does not fully protect a worker's right to receive monetary compensation for compensatory time they may have accrued but not used.  The bill allows workers to accrue as many as 160 hours \u2013 20 full days \u2013 but does not protect that accrued time if employers go out of business or declare bankruptcy.  The Administration continues to support and promote fair and flexible workplace policies that enhance worker productivity and simultaneously benefit employees and employers alike.  We look forward to working with the Congress on proposals that will truly enhance worker-controlled flexibility and that ensure our American workplaces meet the needs of working families and a 21st Century workforce.  This includes support in the President's Budget for state paid leave programs that do not force workers to choose between taking time off for family needs and receiving income, or even risk losing their jobs. The President\u2019s minimum wage proposal would also support working families by making sure that all workers receive enough hourly to make ends meet.  * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration supports enhancing, simplifying, and making permanent the Research and Experimentation Credit (\"R&D credit\"), and offsetting the cost by closing tax loopholes.  Making this credit permanent will increase its effectiveness, since it will allow businesses to make investments and create jobs today confident that they will continue to benefit from the credit in the future.  Moreover, four-fifths of the R&D credit is attributable to salaries of U.S. workers performing U.S.-based research\u2014meaning that the credit helps create high-skilled jobs, as well as encouraging new innovations and future productivity.  However, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4438, which would permanently extend and expand the R&D credit without offsetting the cost, adding to long-run deficits.    By making the R&D credit permanent without offsets, H.R. 4438 would add $156 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years.  Moreover, if this same, unprecedented approach of making major traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.  Last month, House Republicans themselves passed a budget resolution that required offsetting any tax extenders that were made permanent with other revenue measures.  The deficit increase in H.R. 4438 is more than fifteen times the cost of the proposed extension of emergency unemployment benefits, which Republicans are insisting be offset, and more than double the discretionary funding increases for defense and non-defense priorities such as research and development in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which were offset.  House Republicans also are making clear their priorities by rushing to make business tax cuts permanent without offsets even as the House Republican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 25 million working families and students by letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and education tax credits expire.    The Administration wants to work with Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen the economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax reform.

Once the Congress agrees to pay the Government\u2019s bills and end this Government shutdown, the President looks forward to working with the Congress to create jobs and build on the progress the Nation has made to cut the deficit in half since 2009.  But the Nation's economy cannot afford the threat of default and shutdown month after month just so a few Members of Congress can try to force passage of an extreme, failed legislative agenda.  Funding the Government and paying its bills is the Congress's job.  Without an increase in the debt limit, the United States will default on its bills and not have the resources necessary to honor all of its financial commitments, triggering an economic shutdown which could cause irrevocable damage to the Nation\u2019s economy and financial markets.  Swift passage of this bill would put an end to the reckless and irresponsible threat to the Nation's economy and the credit rating of the United States posed by the failure of the Congress to act.

H.R. 1965 would reverse Administration oil and gas leasing reforms that have established orderly, open, efficient, and environmentally sound processes for energy development on public lands.  Specifically, this bill would favor an arbitrary standard for leasing in open areas over leasing on the basis of greatest resource potential; limit the public's opportunity to engage in decisions about the use of public lands; raise the potential for costly litigation, protests, and delays; strip the ability of the Department of the Interior to issue permits to drill based on important environmental reviews, clearances and tribal consultation; and curtail the use of public lands for other uses like hunting, fishing, and recreation.  The legislation would also remove the environmental safeguards that ensure sound Federal leasing decision-making by eliminating appropriate reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, and undermine public resource planning efforts that have established a balanced approach to responsible oil and gas development while providing protection to valuable surface and subsistence resources in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.  H.R.1965 runs contrary to the Administration's commitment to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas development as part of an energy strategy that reduces the Nation\u2019s dependence on foreign oil by increasing domestic production and increasing the fuel economy of the country\u2019s cars and trucks.  Under the Administration\u2019s strategy, the United States now produces more oil at home than the Nation buys from other countries for the first time in nearly two decades.

That process dates back through many Administrations and has effectively addressed cross-border permitting decisions in a manner that serves the national interest.    H.R. 3301 would impose an unreasonable deadline that would curtail the thorough consideration of the issues involved, which could result in serious security, safety, foreign policy, environmental, economic, and other ramifications.  By preventing the opportunity for the necessary assessment of all factors relevant to the national interest, the bill would create significant policy risks and create legal uncertainty for permitting applicants.  Additionally, the bill would prevent assessment of whether modifications to border-crossing pipelines or electric transmission facilities are in the national interest, which is provided for through the current process.   H.R. 3301 would also raise serious trade implications by eliminating the current statutory requirement that the Department of Energy authorize orders for exports and imports of natural gas to and from Canada and Mexico.

Rather than attempting once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which the House has tried to do approximately 50 times, it is time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to get into the middle class.  The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care.  Every day, thousands of Americans are signing up for insurance, and four million have signed up so far.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to a pre-existing medical condition now have access to coverage.  Additionally, the law helps millions of Americans stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26, and provides access to free preventive care like cancer screenings that catch illness early on.    H.R. 4118 would repeal the provision in the coming year that applies only to those Americans who can afford to purchase health insurance but decide not to do so.  In fact, the Affordable Care Act already includes affordability and special-circumstances exceptions for Americans who cannot afford insurance.  And the individual shared responsibility provision is essential to ensuring that the 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can get coverage without being charged more or losing coverage when they get sick. Repealing this part of the law would also result in higher premiums for those who remain insured, fewer premium tax credits for middle-income families, and increased cost-shifting of uncompensated care to health care providers, workers, and businesses.

The SAB, along with other functions, reviews the quality and adequacy of certain scientific and technical information used by EPA or proposed as the basis for EPA regulations.  Therefore, it is imperative that the SAB be composed of the most knowledgeable scientific and technical experts available.  The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which governs Federal advisory committees such as the SAB, provides for balanced panels and subcommittees that include experts with diverse backgrounds who represent wide-ranging perspectives.   H.R. 1422 would negatively affect the appointment of experts and would weaken the scientific independence and integrity of the SAB.  For example, the bill would impose a hiring quota for SAB members based on employment by a State, local, or tribal government as opposed to scientific expertise.

H.R. 1422 also would add burdensome requirements on the SAB with respect to solicitation of and response to public comments, above and beyond those imposed by FACA.  These new requirements would saddle the SAB with workload that would impair its ability to carry out its mandate.  Further, H.R. 1422 would add an unnecessary, burdensome, and costly layer of requirements for hazard and risk assessments without defining the scope of these requirements and absent recognition that many high profile assessments already are reviewed by the SAB.

This is why the Affordable Care Act banned most insurance companies from charging more or excluding coverage based on an individual's pre-existing condition starting in 2014.  It is also why the health care law adopted a temporary high-risk pool plan, called the Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP), to provide a bridge to the new system starting in 2014.  PCIP has provided coverage to Americans who are uninsured and would otherwise be denied health coverage because of their health condition.  Because of the high cost of care for the over 100,000 people enrolled in PCIP, HHS made a number of adjustments to the program, like negotiating lower provider payment rates, to ensure responsible management of the $5 billion provided by the Congress.  To ensure sufficient funding through the year for current enrollees, HHS suspended new enrollment in PCIP starting in February and March, 2013.    While the Administration would like to extend coverage to as many Americans as possible, rather than finding common ground on a funding source, this legislation effectively would repeal part of the Affordable Care Act.  The Affordable Care gives hard-working, middle-class families the security they deserve.  The Affordable Care Act forces most insurance companies to play by the rules, prohibiting them from dropping your coverage if you get sick, billing you into bankruptcy through annual or lifetime limits, and, soon, discriminating against anyone with a pre-existing condition.  The Affordable Care Act created the Prevention and Public Health Fund to help prevent disease, detect it early, and manage conditions before they become severe.  The Fund supports critical investments such as tobacco use reduction, and programs to reduce health-care-associated infections and the national burden of chronic disease, as well as helping to ensure Americans have access to affordable coverage for preventive benefits.  By concentrating on the causes of chronic disease, the Fund helps more Americans stay healthy.   The Fund has maintained high-priority activities to improve health outcomes.  This legislation effectively would eliminate the Prevention Fund for the next three years, forcing an end to key prevention programs it supports.

While the Administration is pleased to see that H.R. 933 is consistent with the mutually agreed upon budget framework in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), the bill raises concerns about the Government's ability to protect consumers, avoid deep cuts in critical services that families depend on, and implement critical domestic priorities such as access to quality and affordable health care.  Furthermore, while the legislation includes the Department of Defense and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies fiscal year 2013 bills, the remainder of Federal agencies are left to operate at last year's level, which will impede their ability to provide services to Americans and efficiently allocate funding to key programs including those in infrastructure, clean energy, education, and research and development.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to refine the legislation to address these concerns.  As the Congress considers this bill, the Administration will continue to press the Congress to eliminate the automatic and arbitrary cuts to current funding levels imposed by the Joint Committee sequestration, which will harm middle class and working Americans while costing the Nation's economy hundreds of thousands of jobs.  The President continues to work to replace sequestration with a larger, balanced deficit reduction agreement that strengthens the middle class by accelerating job creation and growth while coupling serious entitlement reform that strengthens these critical programs with tax reform that raises revenue by closing tax loopholes for the wealthiest Americans.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee's continued support of our national defense and supports a number of the provisions in H.R. 1960, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.  In particular, the Administration appreciates the support of the Committee for authorities that assist the warfighter in operating in unconventional and irregular warfare and countering unconventional threats, support capacity building efforts with foreign military forces, support contingency or stability operations, remove restrictions on the use of U.S. and Japanese funding for the activities related to the realignment of Marines to the Asia-Pacific region, as well its support for programs that would improve the health and well-being of the force.  The Administration appreciates the support of the Congress in working to eliminate the threat that sexual assault in the military presents to our Service members and our national security.  The Administration will continue to work with Congress to identify actions that can be taken to address this urgent priority that is essential to the health and readiness of our Armed Forces.   While there are a number of areas of agreement with the Committee, the Administration has serious concerns with certain provisions.  Several provisions would constrain the ability of the Armed Forces to align military capabilities and force structure with the President's strategy, impede the ability of the Secretary of Defense to reduce overhead and make programs more efficient, and constrain efforts to implement the U.S. strategy for Afghanistan.  In this time of fiscal pressure, we must ensure that scarce resources are directed to the highest priorities for national security.  Moreover, H.R. 1960 assumes adoption of the House Budget Resolution framework, which would hurt our economy and require draconian cuts to middle-class priorities.  These cuts could result in hundreds of thousands of low-income children losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of children with disabilities losing Federal funding for their special education teachers and aides, thousands of Federal agents who can't enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend fugitives, and thousands of scientists without medical grants, which would slow research that could lead to new treatments and cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, and hurt America's economic competitiveness.  As the Administration indicated previously, the President's senior advisors would recommend vetoing any appropriations legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing a classified annex and working with the Congress to address any concerns on classified programs.  However, if the bill is presented to the President for approval in its current form, the President's senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.  Detainee Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1032, 1033, 1034, and 1035, which unwisely and inappropriately interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to manage  detainees in a time of armed conflict.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these and similar provisions in prior versions of this law and has reiterated his call on Congress to lift the restrictions, most recently in his address to the Nation at the National Defense University. Sections 1032, 1033, and 1034 are substantially similar to provisions found in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 and to provisions found in previous years' defense appropriations bill and other legislation.  They would continue unwise funding restrictions that would prohibit the construction or modification of a detention facility in the United States to house Guantanamo detainees, and would constrain our ability to transfer Guantanamo detainees, including those who have already been designated for transfer to other countries.  Operating the facility at Guantanamo weakens our national security by wasting resources, damaging our relationships with key allies, and reinforcing propaganda used by al-Qaeda to attack the United States and our values.  Prohibiting the transfer of detainees to the United States and restricting the transfer of detainees to the custody or effective control of foreign countries or entities in the context of an ongoing armed conflict may interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and to make important foreign policy and national security determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers should occur.  In addition, the restrictions in sections 1033 and 1034 would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  They are also completely unnecessary.  Even in the absence of these restrictions, the Administration has worked \u2013 and in the future would work \u2013 to ensure that any country receiving a detainee would take appropriate security and treatment measures if any detainee is transferred. Section 1035 purports to require the Secretary of Defense to publicly release unclassified summaries containing information about detainees at Parwan determined to represent an enduring security threat to the United States no later than 120 days after the bill's enactment.  This provision would intrude on the President's constitutional authority to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive national security information.  The Administration urges that the provision be deleted or revised to make clear that public disclosure of this information is encouraged, but not mandatory. New START Treaty Implementation Reductions and Nuclear Employment Strategy:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 1052 and 1054(a)(2) and (b), section 1053's requirement that U.S. aircraft basing reductions be contingent on similar Russian reductions, and the reduction in authorization of funds associated with New START Treaty activities in sections 4101 and 4301.  All of these provisions would impinge on the President's ability to implement the New START Treaty and to set U.S. nuclear weapons policy.  In particular, section 1054(a)(2) would purport to restrict the President's constitutional authority to negotiate international agreements, including sole executive agreements for arms reduction, and section 1054(b) would impinge on the President's authority to determine the number of strategic delivery vehicles needed to meet national security requirements and implement changes in those forces as appropriate.  Sections 1052 and 1053 would limit the President's authority to determine appropriate force structure to meet nuclear deterrence requirements and to set nuclear employment policy \u2013 authority exercised by every president in the nuclear age.    Missile Defense:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 232 and 233.  Section 232, which would require the Missile Defense Agency to construct and make operational an additional homeland defense site, ignores possible alternatives, ignores fiscal constraints, presumes a validated military requirement for a third U.S.-based missile defense site when none exists, and is at odds with Congressional direction to complete the evaluation and environmental impact assessment required by section 227 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.  Section 2  233, which would limit the President's authority to determine military requirements in East Asia and around the globe and to deploy U.S. forces accordingly, precludes the best military advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ignores the high-demand/low-density nature of our inventory of missile defense assets, especially given the current budget environment and resulting force levels, and undermines the ability to utilize flexible, adaptable, and relocatable capabilities that can be surged to defend U.S. interests and allies in other regions in times of crisis or conflict.    The Administration also strongly objects to sections 238 and 1253.  Section 238 would require the President to use the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Military Common-Funded Resource process to seek to fund the U.S. national contribution to NATO missile defense, which is contrary to NATO Alliance processes, contrary to longstanding NATO Alliance principles, and contrary to bilateral U.S. missile defense agreements with the Governments of Turkey, Romania, and Poland.  Section 1253 would prohibit funds made available for FY 2014 or thereafter from being used to implement any executive agreement relating to the missile defense capabilities of the United States with a country unless the United States and that country have a treaty of alliance, a security guarantee, or a specific treaty or legislation for such activities.  This restriction would impinge on the President's authority to conduct foreign policy and implement agreements that do not otherwise limit U.S. missile defense capabilities.    Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO):  The Administration strongly objects to the provision of over $5 billion in unrequested OCO funding in the bill.  The President's Budget for FY 2014 fully funds OCO requirements.  TRICARE Fees and Co-Payments:  The Administration believes that military retirees deserve an excellent, sustainable health care benefit.  For this reason, the Administration strongly supports its requested TRICARE fee initiative that seeks to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense (DOD) while keeping retired beneficiaries' share of these costs well below the levels experienced when the TRICARE program was implemented in the mid-1990s.  The projected FY 2014 TRICARE savings of $902 million and $9.3 billion through FY 2018 are essential for DOD to successfully address rising personnel costs.  DOD needs these savings to balance and maintain investments for key defense priorities, especially amidst significant fiscal challenges posed by statutory spending caps.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to support the proposed TRICARE fee initiative.  Military Pay:  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to include the Administration's proposal to slow the military pay raise growth to 1 percent in FY 2014.  Consistent with the views of the uniformed military leadership, the Budget requests a 1.0 percent increase to basic pay, a 4.2 percent increase in the Basic Allowance for Housing, and a 3.4 percent increase in Basic Allowance for Subsistence.  This total compensation level recognizes the sacrifices made by the men and women in our Armed Forces, while adhering to the current budget constraints faced by DOD.  The higher pay raise provided by this bill would cost an additional $0.6 billion in FY 2014 and $3.5 billion from FY 2014 to FY 2018.  As these costs are not offset, deeper reductions to troop levels as well as readiness and modernization accounts would be needed at a time when statutory spending caps require defense reductions.  Permanent Active Duty Minimum End Strength Level for the Army:  The Administration strongly recommends deletion of section 402, which would establish a new minimum active duty Army end strength of 520,000 as of September 30, 2014.  This new minimum level restricts the Army from adjusting end strength to maintain a deliberate and synchronized drawdown plan that maintains 3  operational readiness and accounts for the impact of sequestration across all programs, not just military personnel.  Expansion and Implementation of Protection of Rights of Conscience of Members of the Armed Forces and Chaplains of Such Members:  The Administration strongly objects to section 530, which would require the Armed Forces to accommodate, except in cases of military necessity, \"actions and speech\" reflecting the \"conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs of the member.\"  By limiting the discretion of commanders to address potentially problematic speech and actions within their units, this provision would have a significant adverse effect on good order, discipline, morale, and mission accomplishment.  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC):  The Administration strongly objects to section 2711, which would prohibit DOD from spending any funds to \"propose, plan for, or execute\" an additional BRAC round.  This impinges on Executive Branch prerogatives to plan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the BRAC authorization as requested, which would allow DOD to rightsize its infrastructure as required to meet the fiscal limitation of statutory spending caps, while providing important assistance to affected communities.  Without authorization for a new round of BRAC, DOD may not properly align the military's infrastructure with the needs of our evolving force structure, which is critical to ensuring that limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security.  Limitation on Availability of Funds for Certain Authorities for Afghanistan:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1224, which would prohibit the use of the majority of security and civilian assistance funds for Afghanistan until the Secretary of Defense certifies that a bilateral security agreement with Afghanistan has been signed and meets conditions stipulated in section 1224.  This provision would hamper the President's ability to enter into an executive agreement with a foreign country, by decreasing U.S. negotiating leverage with the Afghan Government, and sends a counter-productive message to our allies and the Afghan people. Limitations on Retirement of Weapon Systems:  The Administration objects to section 132, which would prohibit the cancellation or modification of the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP), and to the authorization of $47 million for Low Rate Initial Production kit procurement for the C-130 AMP.  Retaining AMP would cost $1.6 billion within the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) and an additional $1.1 billion after the FYDP to complete.  DOD plans to cancel the C-130 AMP in part because there is a less expensive solution.  DOD is conducting an independent cost benefit analysis, pursuant to section 143 of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2013, and it would be premature to reinstate AMP before the study is complete.  Also, the Administration objects to section 1022, which restricts DoD from obligating or expending any FY 2014 funds for the retirement, preparation of retirement, inactivation, or storage of a cruiser or dock landing ship.  Although the Congress has provided some near-term funding to operate and modernize these ships, such a restriction is unaffordable over the long term.  Weapon Systems Development:  The Administration strongly objects to section 218, which would require the Secretary of the Air Force to develop a follow-on air-launched cruise missile to the AGM-86 that achieves initial operating capability for both conventional and nuclear missions by 2030.  There is currently no requirement or funding in the Long Range Standoff Weapon program, to develop and field a conventional variant.  The Administration also strongly objects to section 3121, which would require the evaluation of three separate life extension program (LEP) options 4  during the W78/88-1 Phase 6.2/2A Feasibility and Cost Study.  The current study scope will inform a cost/risk/benefit decision on a warhead with an interoperable nuclear explosive package that can be used on multiple platforms.  Changing the study scope to include separate, full scope LEP options for both the W78 and W88 would significantly delay completion of the feasibility study and increase LEP costs.  Modifications to Annual Reports Regarding the Condition of the Nuclear Weapons Stockpile:  The Administration strongly objects to section 3132(b), which would direct \"appropriate officials\" (e.g., national lab directors or the Commander, U.S. Strategic Command) to submit annual assessment letters regarding the condition of the nuclear weapons stockpile directly to the defense committees if the Administration does not submit the assessments by the deadline established by statute.  The Administration strongly believes that the subordinate officials should not submit the assessment letters directly to the Congress.  Alternative Fuels:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 316, 318, and 319, which would impede DOD's use of alternative fuels.  Sections 318 and 319 would inhibit development of a diverse, cost-competitive energy supply that enhances American energy security.  A diverse approach to energy security\u2014one that includes both conventional and new sources\u2014will provide an enduring benefit for our economy and military capabilities.  Section 316, which would exempt DOD from section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, undercuts a law passed with strong bipartisan support that provides an environmentally sound framework for the development of future alternative fuels.  Nuclear Treaty Matters:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1254, which would prohibit the obligation or expenditure of FY 2014 funds for Threat Reduction Engagement activities until the President certifies to the Congress that no state party to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty has undertaken nuclear weapons test activities in FY 2013 that are inconsistent with the United States interpretations regarding obligations under such Treaty.  The Administration also objects to section 1055, which would require the President to consult with the Congress and submit a plan for engaging foreign countries that are found to be not in compliance with their treaty obligations.  Both provisions would hamper the President's ability to execute foreign policy.  Extension of Authority for Task Force for Business and Stability Operations in Afghanistan:  The Administration requests that the House include the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations (TFBSO) in Afghanistan proposal, which would reauthorize the continuation of key projects in Afghanistan that bolster its economic stability.  Because many of these projects are conducted in direct coordination and partnership with Afghan ministries, the abrupt cessation of TFBSO would erode trust the U.S. Government has built with the Government of Afghanistan.  Office of Security Cooperation in Iraq (OSC-I):  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support for the OSC-I.  However, section 1214 does not include the Administration's requested language to authorize the OSC-I to conduct non-operational training activities in support of the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) personnel.  This authority is needed to continue supporting the Government of Iraq's efforts to address Iraqi CTS capability gaps.  Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF):  The Administration objects to the elimination of funding request for JUONF.  This funding is critical to DOD's ability to quickly respond to urgent operational needs of Combatant Commanders.  Elimination of funding may delay fielding of important capabilities that help accomplish critical missions. 5   Building Capacity of Foreign Military Forces:  The Administration appreciates the continued support of the Congress in section 1201 for building partnership capacity in foreign military and security forces, but has concerns regarding provisions addressing theater security priorities and advanced project formulation.  Section 1201 could undermine the speed and flexibility of section 1206 authority.  We look forward to working with the Congress to integrate authorities with the implementation of the recent Presidential policy on security sector assistance.  Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrant Visas (SIV):  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of section 1216, relating to authority for SIVs for certain Iraqi and Afghan allies.  The Administration supports extension of these programs, but notes its concern that the periods of extension provided for under section 1216 are not sufficient to meet projected program demand for either Iraq or Afghanistan.  Further, the much reduced number of visas for the Afghan SIV program \u2013 just 435 per year \u2013 falls well short of expected demand, as evidenced by the volume of applications in FY 2013 to date.  We look forward to working with the Congress on these and other appropriate modifications to section 1216 to ensure Iraqi and Afghan allies who have aided U.S. efforts in these countries through their work, and who are experiencing an ongoing serious threat as a result, are able to apply for these visas.  Defense Clandestine Service (DCS):  The Administration strongly objects to section 923, which would restrict the implementation of the DCS.  The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress to resolve its need for additional information on DCS but should not be limited to defense priorities in the implementation of this important intelligence collection program.  National Intelligence Program Consolidation:  The Administration strongly objects to section 924 because the provision's prohibitions would impinge on the President's prerogatives to seek efficient budget structures and unduly constrain the President in future budget decisions.   Transportation of Supplies for the United States by Aircraft Operated by United States Air Carriers:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1082, which would require Federal agencies, except DOD, to ship 50 percent of air cargo using aircraft that are owned by U.S. carriers and registered in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).  This provision would not provide meaningful benefit for CRAF participants but would reduce operational flexibility and increase costs for Defense and non-Defense agencies.  The Fly America Act already requires agencies to show preference for U.S.-flag carriers when soliciting contracts and to use those carriers where appropriate.  The provision would increase costs to the taxpayer while decreasing the effectiveness and reach of U.S. programs worldwide.  Unrequested Funding:  In this fiscally constrained environment, the Administration objects to the addition of unnecessary funding, for example $168 million of unrequested increased authorization for the M-1 Abrams tank, and to the authorization of $135.1 million of unrequested funding to procure and to field additional Light Utility Helicopters.  The requirement for U.S. tanks will be fulfilled in December 2014, and the Army will not need to begin recapitalization of the Abrams tank fleet until the 2019 time frame.  Purple Hearts for Fort Hood and Little Rock Victims:  The Administration objects to section 585, which would require the award of the Purple Heart to the service members killed or wounded in the attacks that occurred at Fort Hood, Texas, on November 5, 2009, and Little Rock, Arkansas on June 1, 2009.  This provision is inconsistent with the award criteria for the Purple Heart. 6   Governance of Nuclear Security Enterprise:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 3122 and 3202.  These sections are premature with the ongoing work of the congressional governance advisory panel.  The provisions to further expand the Kansas City Plant pilot could result in the unacceptable reduction of protection to workers, the public and security interests.  The Administration is concerned that piece-meal exemptions for nuclear operations and possibly for other high-risk operations would serve to exacerbate inconsistencies and confusion, and add governance, management, and oversight uncertainty across the enterprise.  Section 3202 severely hampers the ability of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board to provide external, independent oversight of DOE's defense nuclear facilities.  The provision to respond to a Secretarial request to perform a cost-benefit analysis of a Board recommendation is inconsistent with the underlying precepts of adequate protection of public health and safety.  These provisions inappropriately diminish the Secretary's role as operator and regulator of DOE's defense nuclear facilities and compromise the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board's core mission to protect workers and the public.  Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic (STEM) programs:  The Administration objects to restoring funding for the STARBASE program and the National Defense Education PK-12 program in section 4201 and 4301.  This would perpetuate the Federal Government's fragmented approach to STEM education (more than 220 programs across 13 agencies) and is inconsistent with the Administration's proposed reorganization of STEM programs, which would improve STEM education quality and outcomes across the Federal Government.  Requirement to Withhold DOD Assistance to Afghanistan Equivalent to Taxes Assessed by Afghanistan:  While the Administration agrees there is a significant opportunity to improve tax collection in Afghanistan, section 1217 could be counterproductive.  This provision would also impose an unreasonable administrative burden on agencies and could inadvertently undermine capacity building efforts in Afghanistan.  Foreign Commercial Satellite Services:  The Administration objects to the language in section 1605 that would prevent DOD from entering into contracts for satellite services that involve certain covered foreign countries, except when the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, provides a waiver.  Such a constraint would limit DOD's flexibility to provide timely support to the warfighter, who frequently requires expeditious access to satellite communications in areas with austere to non-existent communications infrastructure.  Government-wide Limitation on Allowable Cost for Contractor Compensation:  The Administration appreciates the intent of section 813 to reform the cap establishing the reimbursement limit on compensation for contractor employees.  However, the Administration urges adoption of its proposal that would tie the cap to the President's salary; this approach is more cost-effective and would achieve a better result for taxpayers than the proposed approach of retaining a high cap based on a flawed formula for most employees while allowing no reimbursement for the contractor's highest paid executives.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on adoption of a fiscally responsible cap that ends excessive contractor payments in a fair and effective manner.  Constitutional Concerns:  A number of the bill's provisions raise additional constitutional concerns, including encroachment on the President's exclusive authorities related to international negotiations.  7  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns.  * * * * * * *   8  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2610, making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other purposes.  The bill severely undermines critical investments in economic and community development programs that drive local innovation, while also significantly reducing resources for public improvements, air traffic control infrastructure, affordable housing, as well as public services for low- to moderate-income families.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2610, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   In addition, enacting H.R. 2610, while adhering to the overall spending limits in the House Budget's topline discretionary level for fiscal year (FY) 2014, would hurt our economy and require draconian cuts to middle-class priorities.  These cuts could result in hundreds of thousands of low-income children losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of children with disabilities losing Federal funding for their special education teachers and aides, thousands of Federal agents who can't enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend fugitives, and thousands of scientists without medical grants, which would slow research that could lead to new treatments and cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, and hurt America's economic competitiveness.   More than three months have passed since the deadline for action and the Congress has yet to appoint conferees and agree on a budget resolution.  Prior to consideration of appropriations bills the Congress should complete an appropriate framework for all the appropriations bills that supports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national security for our economy to compete in the future.  As such, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2610 and any other legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.    Department of Transportation (DOT)  Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.  The Administration strongly opposes the elimination of funding for TIGER Grants.  This competitive grant program is critical in helping communities around the country leverage their own resources to complete critical transportation projects.  This program has been oversubscribed since its inception because TIGER Grants fund multimodal projects that are meritorious but can be difficult to fund within the current stove-piped financing structures.  Further, the $237 million rescission of FY 2013 funding included  in the Committee bill would dramatically disrupt DOT's execution of the ongoing TIGER grant-making process, and could necessitate the withdrawal of awards to current grantees.  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Operations.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's efforts to prioritize FAA Operations funding.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to fund FAA Operations at the level of the request of $9.7 billion, which allows the agency to hire in order to keep pace with attrition in its aviation safety and controller workforce.  FAA Facilities, Equipment, and NextGen.  The Administration strongly opposes the $623 million reduction below the FY 2014 Budget request for the facilities and equipment account in the Committee bill.  The funding level in the bill is roughly equal to the FY 2000 appropriated level.  This reduction would significantly slow, if not terminate, several aspects of FAA's maintenance of current facilities, equipment, and the modernization of the Nation's air traffic control system through NextGen.  The Committee bill specifically identifies reductions to critical infrastructure programs, such as back-up electrical power systems, which are essential for maintaining reliable and safe control of airspace during commercial power outages like those experienced as a result of Hurricane Sandy, and would require a nearly $400 million reduction to NextGen from the $1 billion requested in the FY 2014 Budget.  National Railroad Passenger Corporations (Amtrak).  The Administration strongly opposes the funding level included in the Committee bill for Amtrak.  The $350 million provided for Amtrak operations and $600 million for Amtrak Capital and Debt service do not sufficiently fund these important activities.  These reductions to Amtrak funding, which has long been underfunded, will cause significant delays in much needed capital investments and will result in deteriorated performance, especially in the Northeast Corridor, where ridership is at an all-time high.  High Speed Rail.  The Administration objects to the prohibition on funding for the California High Speed Rail project.  The California High Speed Rail project, which was approved by California voters as well as the California State Legislature, will spur job creation, decrease California's footprint distance, reduce the amount of energy used per person, and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Capital Investment (New Starts) Grants.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $1.98 billion proposed in the FY 2014 Budget and to allow FTA to retain the $151 million in unallocated and unobligated funds for New Starts.  While the level in the Committee bill would provide funds for all existing grant agreements, it only provides funding for the new Small Starts projects recommended in the Budget, halting the pipeline for any new construction on larger New Starts or Core Capacity projects.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Core Rental Assistance.  The Administration strongly opposes the $3.0 billion reduction to HUD's core rental assistance programs:  Housing Choice Vouchers; Project-Based Rental Assistance; and Public Housing.  The bill provides $33.8 billion, which is 8 percent below the FY 2014 Budget request.  The Committee bill would support approximately 125,000 fewer housing vouchers for very low-income families, and would again require HUD to short-fund contracts with private housing owners and reduce payments to public housing authorities.  Homeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the FY 2014 Budget request for Homeless Assistance Grants, which funds a variety of intervention programs that 2  serve homeless and at-risk individuals and families.  The Administration opposes the funding level provided for Homeless Assistance Grants, which is $293 million, or 12 percent, below the FY 2014 Budget request.  At this level, HUD would not be able to renew all existing grants that provide housing and shelter for the homeless, which would impact more than 86,000 homeless and formerly homeless households, including many veterans.  Choice Neighborhoods.  The Administration strongly objects to the $120 million rescission included in the bill for the Choice Neighborhoods program, and urges the Congress to provide the $400 million requested in the FY 2014 Budget.  Without this funding, public housing authorities and other local entities will have limited resources to support the revitalization of distressed HUD-assisted housing and to build ladders of opportunity for low-income families by improving economic development, creating jobs, and helping residents access educational opportunities in the surrounding neighborhoods.   Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and Related Programs.  The Administration strongly opposes the $1.7 billion funding level provided for the CDBG program, which would have significant impacts on State and local resources for public improvements, infrastructure, affordable housing, and public services for low to moderate income families. The Administration also strongly opposes the lack of funding for Integrated Planning and Investment Grants and the new Neighborhood Stabilization Initiative.  The Administration urges the Congress to support these programs at the requested levels to invest in regional and local planning efforts and to support neighborhoods still feeling the effects of the foreclosure crisis.  In addition, the Administration objects to the level of funding for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which is $250 million below the Budget request.  The Administration urges the Congress to support this program at the requested level in order to increase the supply of affordable housing.   Housing Counseling.  The Administration opposes the reductions included in the Committee bill for counseling programs in HUD and the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation of $39 million, or 30 percent, below the Administration's request.  While the housing market has improved, there are still many households facing the aftermath of the financial crisis and counseling is an important resource in helping households find affordable and stable housing.   Housing Opportunities for People Living with AIDS (HOPWA).  The Administration strongly opposes the $29 million reduction to HUD's program to provide housing for people living with HIV/AIDS.  The bill provides $303 million, which is 9 percent below the FY 2014 Budget request.  In the face of the ongoing domestic HIV epidemic, this cut would result in nearly 5,000 people losing housing services, severely affecting the health of homeless and marginally housed people living with HIV/AIDS and increasing treatment costs.  Civilian Pay Raise  The Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for Federal civilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  3  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are tailored to advance statutory goals in a manner that is efficient and cost-effective, and that minimizes uncertainty.  By layering on additional, burdensome judicial review and other unnecessary changes to the regulatory process, H.R. 899, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2013, would introduce needless uncertainty into agency decision-making and undermine the ability of agencies to provide critical public health and safety protections.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 899.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and well-understood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been guided by executive orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  The President's regulatory approach has been consistent throughout his Administration.  We don\u2019t have to choose between protecting the health, welfare, and safety of Americans and promoting economic growth, job creation, competitiveness, and innovation\u2014we can do both.  To this end, Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, increased public participation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, and flexible regulatory approaches.  Through executive orders and other presidential directives, agencies must ensure that they take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.  And, through Executive Orders 13579 and 13610, the Administration has also taken important steps to promote systematic retrospective review of regulations by all agencies, including encouraging independent agencies to conduct such a review.  Collectively, these requirements promote flexible, cost-effective regulation.  H.R. 899 would unnecessarily add to the already robust analytical and procedural requirements of the rulemaking process.  In particular, H.R. 899 would create needless grounds for judicial review, unduly slowing the regulatory process.  In addition, it would add layers of procedural steps that would interfere with agency priority setting and compliance with statutory mandates.  If H.R. 899 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  *  *  *  *  *  *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House joint passage of H.J.

The House should allow a straight up or down vote on Senate-passed H.J. Res. 59 to reopen the Government, bring all the Nation's dedicated civil servants back to work, and provide the services middle class Americans deserve.  In addition, the House should pass a clean debt ceiling bill without drama or delay so that the United States can continue to pay its bills and fulfill the Nation's obligations.  The President has been clear that he is open to discussing a broad range of measures to support the Nation's economy, create jobs and further reduce the deficit, once the Congress meets its responsibility to open the Government and pay its bills.  If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 89 and H.R. 3273, he would veto the legislation.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 3189, which would prohibit the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) from exerting some control over the exercise of water rights located on Federal lands.  The bill threatens the Federal government's longstanding authority to manage property and claim proprietary rights for the benefit of Indian tribes and reserved Federal lands, and the broader public that depends on the proper management of public lands and resources.  It adversely affects DOI's and USDA's ability to manage water resources to:  (1) protect ongoing public lands uses and the environment; (2) allow for maximum beneficial use of Federal water facilities; and (3) ensure adequate water is available for fisheries or threatened or endangered species.  H.R. 3189 is overly broad and could have numerous unintended consequences.  For example, the bill could impede private water rights holders from entering into voluntary agreements with Federal agencies, which benefit State, Federal, and private water rights holders' interests and improve water resource management.  The bill was introduced, in part, to address the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s ski area water rights clause proposal, which the Forest Service has changed in response to public feedback and will soon be publishing.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address any remaining concerns regarding the ski area water rights proposal after its publication and to developing legislation that maintains the Federal government's interest in protecting public lands and waters, allows for the continuance of voluntary agreements between the Federal government and other water rights holders, and ensures adequate protection of the environment.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4453, which would permanently extend two current provisions of law that offer tax breaks for S-corporations without offsetting the cost, adding to long-run deficits.    If this unprecedented approach of making certain traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits over the next ten years, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.  Just two months ago, House Republicans passed a budget resolution that required offsetting any tax extenders that were made permanent with other revenue measures.  This bill violates that standard.   With this legislation, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the deficit to fund tax breaks for businesses, while insisting on offsetting the cost of measures that help middle-class and working Americans, such as the proposed extension of emergency unemployment benefits.  House Republicans also are making clear their priorities by rushing to make business tax cuts permanent without offsets even as the House Republican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 25 million working families and students by letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and education tax credits expire.    The Administration wants to work with Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen the economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax reform.

The Administration appreciates that the House bill allows critical Government functions to operate without interruption and avoids a damaging Government shutdown.  While the Administration acknowledges that the bill reauthorizes the Export-Import Bank, the Administration encourages the Congress to pass a long-term extension to provide certainty to job-creators that export U.S.-made products and services.  The Administration appreciates efforts to address the Ebola epidemic and support prevention efforts.    The Administration urges the Congress to establish spending levels for FY 2015 in comprehensive full-year appropriations legislation that appropriately funds national security requirements, while also funding critical domestic priorities that promote economic growth, opportunity, and innovation.

Under the CAA, EPA periodically reviews National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants that are harmful to public health and the environment and updates the standards if necessary based on relevant science.  H.R. 4795 would prohibit the application of these science-based updates for permitting major sources of air pollution until additional guidance and regulations are issued.  This arbitrary and unnecessary requirement could delay important public health protections.   H.R. 4795 could force EPA to issue detailed guidance and regulations that would impact the pre-construction permitting process without the benefit of collaborative input from States and regulated entities.  This could result in the issuance of regulations and guidance for applying the updated NAAQS that are not tailored to the needs of the regulated entities, thus potentially creating confusion and uncertainty for both States and industry.  Further, requiring EPA to produce premature implementing guidance and regulations could increase legal vulnerabilities for States and the Federal Government, adding additional uncertainty and further delaying the important health protections provided by the NAAQS.    Finally, this legislation could potentially lead to an inconsistent application of an updated NAAQS, which could result in some major sources of pollution having to achieve additional emissions reductions to make up for sources that become partially exempted.  This additional unnecessary confusion and the potential resulting inequities for affected businesses and States is contrary to both the stated purpose of the bill and to the CAA.

Forty  years ago, the  Supreme Court affirmed a woman's constitutional right to privacy, including  the right to choose.  This bill is a direct challenge to Roe v.

As the Administration said when this legislation was considered previously, H.R. 2641 will increase litigation, regulatory delays, and potentially force agencies to approve a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed arbitrary deadlines.

Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., the same coverage that everyone else is offered without interference by their employers.  Preventive health services, when accessible and affordable, have the potential to prevent disease, manage chronic illness, and save lives as well as dollars.  That is why the Affordable Care Act ensures that Americans have coverage for preventive care like vaccines, cancer screenings, and contraception that medical experts have concluded are critical to the Nation's health.  According to a recent analysis by the Department of Health and Human Services, an estimated 76 million people have gained preventive services coverage since the law passed, and there are now an estimated 48.5 million women enrolled in private plans that are required to cover contraception without cost-sharing.  Contraception has significant health benefits, as documented by the independent Institute of Medicine, and coverage removes cost as a barrier to its use.  One study found that in 2013, the year the coverage requirement started, utilization increased and women saved $483 million.  However, the Supreme Court's rulings in Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Burwell, allow some employers to now withhold contraception coverage from their employees based on their own religious beliefs that their employees may not share.  The Administration believes that women should make personal health care decisions for themselves, rather than their employers deciding for them.  This legislation would restore that right.  It would prevent owners of for-profit companies from asserting their personal religious views to deny their employees Federally-required health benefits.  At the same time, it would preserve the regulatory exemption for religious organizations like houses of worship and an accommodation for eligible nonprofit religious organizations, like some charities, that have religious objections to contraception coverage.  This legislation is consistent with the congressional intent in enacting the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.  The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2578 and remains committed to working with the Congress to improve the affordability and accessibility of health care for all Americans.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports passage of S. 2432, which would provide Americans with student loans the opportunity to refinance their loans at the lower interest rates available to current students.  The legislation would benefit an estimated 25 million Americans and save a typical borrower $2,000 over the life of his or her loan.  It would strengthen the economy by offering relief to Americans who are working hard to pay back their student loans and launch careers, start families, or buy homes.   S. 2432 would offset the cost of its refinancing provisions by implementing the \u201cBuffett Rule,\u201d which would set a minimum tax rate for taxpayers with annual incomes over $1 million.  The Administration strongly supports this proposal to ensure that the Nation\u2019s wealthiest are not able to use tax preferences and shelters to reduce their tax rate below what many middle-class families pay.   The Administration is committed to working with Congress on ensuring that college remains affordable for American families by promoting innovation and competition within higher education, maintaining funding for critical Federal student aid like Pell Grants, and assuring borrowers that affordable repayment options will exist to help them meet their financial obligations after they leave school.   *******    ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4923, making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes.  The bill significantly underfunds critical investments that develop American energy sources to build a clean and secure energy future, support the emerging clean energy technologies that create high-quality jobs, and enhance the Nation's economic competiveness.  The legislation also excessively restricts nonproliferation contracts with Russia and prevents the development of lower cost technologies for disposal of excess plutonium.  Further, the bill includes objectionable environmental riders that would prevent the use of funds to address known deficiencies and regulatory uncertainties related to Clean Water Act regulations that protect important aquatic resources while supporting economic development.  If the President were presented with H.R. 4923, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations process that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding unnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include reconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and national security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an orderly appropriations process.   The President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our national security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same time, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to deliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.    The President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels.  However, the levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation and are not sufficient\u2014either in FY 2015 or beyond\u2014to ensure the Nation is achieving its full potential.  For that reason, the Budget also includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative\u2014evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities\u2014that presents additional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would support a number of investments, including additional applied research to accelerate the development and deployment of new energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies; a Race to the Top for Energy Efficiency and Grid  Modernization that would incentivize States to increase energy productivity and improve grid reliability and resilience; research into breakthrough technologies; and local planning assistance that would help communities better prepare for the effects of climate change.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to fund critical programs that promote advances in clean energy, improve energy security, and enhance preparedness and resilience to climate change.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve the issues raised below during the FY 2015 appropriations process.  Department of Energy (DOE)  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  The Administration strongly objects to the funding level of $1.8 billion provided in the bill for renewable energy, sustainable transportation, and energy efficiency programs, a $546 million reduction below the FY 2015 Budget request.  This reduced funding level will stifle Federal investment in innovative clean energy research and development (R&D) at a time of significant global competition and progress.  The Administration is also disappointed that the bill does not include transfer language to support joint efforts with the Navy and the Department of Agriculture to develop advanced drop-in biofuels for military applications, a provision included in the FY 2014 enacted bill.  The Administration appreciates the support for offshore wind technology demonstrations and for the Clean Energy Manufacturing Innovation Institutes.    Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2015 Budget request for ARPA-E at the level of $280 million.  The $45 million reduction from the FY 2015 Budget request would impact investments and delay improvements in technologies that reduce energy\u2013related emissions, increase energy efficiency across multiple economic sectors, and reduce energy imports.    Environmental Management.  The Administration appreciates support for cleanup activities funded at $5.6 billion.    Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund.  The Administration opposes the elimination of appropriations for the contribution to the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund.  The Administration's proposal to reauthorize the Fund relies on this funding to address the significant shortfall in resources allocated for cleanup of shutdown uranium enrichment plants that supported nuclear weapons production and commercial power generation.    Office of Science.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2015 Budget request for the Office of Science.  The $40 million reduction from the FY 2015 Budget request would reduce the number of grants to academic investigators and funding for staff at DOE laboratories working on fundamental discovery science and research that underpins advances in clean energy.  This reduction would also affect access to world class facilities used by researchers from all sectors to conduct R&D.  The bill funds the international fusion project ITER, at a level $75 million above the FY 2015 Budget request.  In light of schedule delays and management reforms underway, the Administration is concerned that the U.S. contributions would outpace the 2  readiness of the project.    National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the requested funding level for NNSA's Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and Weapons Activities programs.    Naval Reactors.  The Administration strongly objects to the $162 million reduction to the Naval Reactors program from the FY 2015 Budget request.  Together with the $151 million reduction in the FY 2014 enacted bill, this reduction would continue to put the U.S. Navy's nuclear powered fleet at risk and would jeopardize the program's ability to train nuclear-qualified sailors. The bill also continues to underfund the Spent Fuel Handling Facility Recapitalization Project in Idaho, risking the operational availability of aircraft carriers and submarines and increasing costs to the Department of Defense.    Nuclear Nonproliferation Cooperation with Russia.  The Administration strongly objects to the language in the bill that would prevent the use of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation appropriations for contracts with, or Federal assistance to, the Russian Federation.  Nonproliferation cooperation with the Russian Federation is in the U.S. national interest and remains an essential element of the global effort to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism.  Critical bilateral nuclear nonproliferation activities are continuing in a number of key areas, such as improving physical protection and reducing insider threats at vulnerable Russian facilities.      Disposition of Weapons-Usable Plutonium.  The Administration strongly objects to language that would require the Secretary of Energy to continue construction of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility.  The Administration plans to move the facility into cold stand-by in FY 2015 as it continues to explore the potential for more cost effective alternatives while maintaining the U.S. Government's commitment to disposing of unneeded plutonium.  Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  The Administration urges the Congress to strike the language in the bill that prohibits the use of funding to acquire any petroleum product other than crude oil.  This provision would hinder the future ability of the Executive Branch to respond effectively to changing circumstances in national and international markets.    Yucca Mountain.  The Administration objects to the DOE funding provided in the bill for Yucca Mountain and is disappointed with the Committee's rejection of the practical solutions proposed in the Administration's nuclear waste strategy.  As reflected in the FY 2015 Budget request, this strategy incorporates important and workable elements for a successful waste program, such as consent-based siting, interim storage of waste, and program funding reforms that are essential to the success of a Nuclear Waste Program.  Similarly, the Administration objects to funding provided in the bill for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to continue adjudication of the Yucca Mountain license application.   Statutory by Reference Provision.  The Administration urges the Congress to strike the language in the bill that incorporates the specific funding directions of the Committee bill report table into the statute by reference.  Enactment of this provision would unduly limit the flexibility of the Department to manage programs and projects efficiently.     3  Corps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works (Corps)  Overall Funding.  The bill provides $5.5 billion for the Corps civil works program, nearly $1 billion above the FY 2015 Budget request.  The FY 2015 Budget focuses on investments that would yield high economic and environmental returns or address a significant risk to public safety.  The Administration encourages the Congress to fund the civil works program at the requested level.  The funding increase for the civil works program is provided primarily by decreases in other core priorities, including clean energy.  The Administration also urges the Congress to permit the Corps to commence new starts in FY 2015.   Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.  The Administration opposes the Committee's provision of only $2 million for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, $3 million, or 60 percent below the FY 2014 enacted level and the FY 2015 Budget request.  Such a significant reduction would impede the ability of the Office of the Assistant Secretary to carry out its mission to oversee execution of the civil works program.  This work is critical to ensuring efficient use of taxpayer dollars and effective management of the civil works program in the development, management, and restoration of the Nation's water resources.   Clean Water Act (CWA).  The Administration strongly objects to sections 105 and 106 of the bill, which would prevent the use of funds to address deficiencies and regulatory uncertainties related to CWA regulations designed to protect important aquatic resources while supporting economic development.  Section 106 in particular would impact an important, ongoing Administration effort to provide regulatory clarity on which water bodies are covered by the CWA, which has been the subject of two Supreme Court cases in which the Court indicated the need for greater clarity regarding the statute's scope.    Firearms Policy.  The Administration opposes section 107 of the bill, which prohibits the Corps from enforcing its ban on firearms on Corps lands.  If enacted, this provision would prevent the Secretary of the Army from using the discretion now provided in law to enforce or revise the current Corps policy, based on consideration for public and employee safety, the security of critical infrastructure, and the manner in which the firearm is carried (e.g., open vs. concealed).  Corps rangers are not authorized to carry firearms and do not have Federal law enforcement authority.   Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and Central Utah Project  Overall Funding.  The bill provides $957 million for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project, $29 million below the FY 2015 Budget request.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the Bureau of Reclamation water resources program, including its support for water conservation funding that is even more critical during this period of extreme drought, the Administration urges the Congress to restore funding for the San Joaquin River Restoration and Policy and Administration.    San Joaquin River Restoration.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's elimination of funding for this program, which would undermine the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement's goals to restore and maintain fish populations and reduce or avoid water supply impacts.  This restoration program is a multi-year effort that is integral to the implementation of Federal legislation that settled 18 years of litigation.  The Congress has 4  provided funding each year since authorizing, and the Administration urges the Congress to provide FY 2015 funding for this Administration priority at the level requested.  Policy and Administration.  The Administration objects to the $5.7 million, or 10 percent, reduction in funding from the FY 2015 Budget request for Reclamation's Policy and Administration account.  The FY 2015 Budget already proposed a reduction of $500,000 in recognition of budget constraints.  The Committee's additional reduction would significantly impair Reclamation's ability to conduct oversight, manage the agency effectively, and be responsive to the Congress and the American public.   Central Utah Project (CUP).  The Administration urges the Congress to consolidate the CUP into the Bureau of Reclamation as requested in the FY 2015 Budget.  The consolidation would simplify many administrative, budgeting, and reporting tasks while not adversely affecting project performance.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  5  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1582.  The bill would require the Department of Energy to undertake duplicative, costly, and time consuming reviews of energy-related EPA rules, thereby delaying or permanently preventing EPA from fulfilling its legal obligations to protect public health and the environment.  Existing law already requires agencies to submit cost-benefit analysis to the Congress of any rule costing over $100 million annually.  H.R. 1582 would require agencies to waste limited analytical resources on a duplicative analysis.  Further, by indefinitely delaying the implementation of existing public health and environmental laws, the bill would harm communities affected by pollution.  This delay would also create uncertainty for regulated businesses, inhibiting their decision-making and planning efforts.  Finally, H.R. 1582 would likely result in unnecessary litigation, since it would prevent EPA from meeting its statutory obligations to finalize rules within specified timeframes.  If H.R. 1582 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.    * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports passage of H.R. 3136, Advancing Competency-Based Education Demonstration Project Act of 2014, which promotes innovative higher education approaches that would help Americans obtain the education and skills that are needed in today's economy.  This legislation would build on the work announced by the President last August to promote better innovation and competition in our higher education system, and help ensure that more Americans have access to high-quality, flexible higher education opportunities that meet their needs, particularly for adult learners who may be struggling to manage work and family responsibilities along with their educational pursuits.    While the bill provides a modest step forward to help students access new higher education models, it does not provide any additional financial resources.  The Administration urges the Congress to do more to ensure that college is affordable for American families.  This is particularly important today, when a college education is critical to ensuring that our workforce has the skills needed to meet the demands of the Nation's growing economy.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to improve the legislation.  * * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration is firmly committed to strengthening the Nation's financial system through the implementation of key reforms to safeguard derivatives markets and ensure a stronger and fairer financial system for investors and consumers.  The full benefit to the Nation's citizens and the economy cannot be realized unless the entities charged with establishing and enforcing the rules of the road have the resources to do so.    The Administration strongly opposes the passage of H.R. 4413 because it undermines the efficient functioning of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by imposing a number of organizational and procedural changes and offers no solution to address the persistent inadequacy of the agency's funding.  The CFTC is one of only two Federal financial regulators funded through annual discretionary appropriations, and the funding the Congress has provided for it over the past four years has failed to keep pace with the increasing complexity of the Nation's financial markets.  The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act resulted in significant expansion of the CFTC's responsibilities.  The proposed changes would hinder the CFTC's progress in successfully implementing these critical responsibilities and would unnecessarily disrupt the effective management and operation of the agency, without providing the more robust and reliable funding that the agency needs.  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes the substitute amendment to H.R. 5759 that seeks to restrict the President\u2019s immigration accountability actions.  H.R. 5759 would make the broken immigration system worse, not better.  By attempting to restrict the Administration\u2019s ability to conduct national security and criminal background checks on undocumented immigrants, H.R. 5759 would make the Nation\u2019s communities less safe.  By attempting to make it more difficult for undocumented workers to register and pay taxes, the bill would hurt the Nation\u2019s economy as well.   The President\u2019s recently announced immigration accountability executive actions will help secure the border, hold potentially more than 4 million undocumented immigrants accountable, and ensure that everyone plays by the same rules.  In particular, these actions will allow undocumented immigrants who have resided in the United States for five or more years, are not priorities for removal, and are parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents to seek temporary immigration relief, on a case-by-case basis, by registering, passing background checks, and paying their fair share of taxes.  These actions also give additional DREAMers the opportunity to request immigration relief under the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy.   The bill\u2019s objective is clearly to nullify and block implementation of these executive actions, which would have devastating consequences.  It would lead to the separation of families and prevent additional DREAMers from fully contributing to American life.  It would also make it more difficult for immigration officials to conduct background checks, for undocumented workers to help the economy by paying taxes, and for the Federal government to focus on removing serious criminals, recent border crossers, and other threats.  The President\u2019s actions will increase accountability in the Nation\u2019s broken immigration system while he continues to urge the Congress to finish the job and pass commonsense immigrationreform that offers meaningful solutions to the broken system.

H.R. 2 is a reiteration of various bills that previously have been voted on by the House during this Congress, including several for which the Administration has issued Statements of Administration Policy strongly opposing the bills and stating that, if presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto them.    Specifically, H.R. 2 would roll back policies that support the continued growth of safe and responsible energy production in the United States.  It also would discourage environmental analysis and civic engagement in Federal decision-making.  Furthermore, the bill would impose a system for automatic approval of natural gas pipeline projects that could lead to confusion, increased litigation, delay, and potential denial of the projects that the bill intends to expedite.  It also would circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether cross-border pipelines and electric transmission facilities are in the national interest by removing the presidential permitting requirement.   H.R. 2 would endanger public health and the environment by halting U.S. progress in cutting dangerous carbon pollution from power plants, prohibiting the Federal Government from ensuring that hydraulic fracturing activities taking place on Federal and Indian lands are managed in a safe and responsible manner, and requiring the implementation of a court-vacated rule that would not adequately protect drinking water and watersheds from strip mining.  The bill also would delay or potentially prevent the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from fulfilling its legal obligation to protect public health and the environment by requiring the Department of Energy to undertake duplicate, costly, and time consuming reviews of energy-related EPA rules.   H.R. 2 runs contrary to the Administration's commitment to promoting safe and responsible domestic oil and gas development as part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy to increase domestic production and reduce dependence on foreign oil, while protecting the environment and human health.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration recognizes and appreciates the service and sacrifice made by servicemembers and veterans on behalf of the American people, and is committed to ensuring that we care for and honor our servicemembers, veterans, and their families.  S. 2450 would make a number of changes to authorities related to, among other things, improving access to care, training and hiring of health care staff, health care related to military sexual trauma, and veterans' education benefits.  The bill reinforces a number of the Administration's efforts to address the challenges facing today's servicemembers, veterans, and their families.  S. 2450 supports efforts to continue improving veterans' access to healthcare, including for victims of military sexual trauma, and expanded access to education benefits for veterans.    Our number one priority is getting veterans the care they\u2019ve earned.  To do that, we need to make sure that the problems identified at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities get fixed.  This is why the President immediately directed VA to investigate these issues.  VA is taking a number of immediate actions to enhance timely access to care across the country, and will continue to do so.  The Administration strongly supports S. 2450 and looks forward to working with the Congress, and our veteran stakeholder community, to continue to promote the efficient use of taxpayer dollars while properly defining and implementing timely solutions to ensure that our veterans receive the care they\u2019ve earned.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2575, the Save American Workers Act, because it would significantly increase the deficit and reduce the number of Americans with employer-based health insurance coverage.  Rather than attempting once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which the House has tried to do over 50 times, it is time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to get into the middle class.  This legislation would weaken a provision of the Affordable Care Act that keeps employers from dropping health insurance coverage and shifting the costs to taxpayers.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, it would increase the budget deficit by $73.7 billion over the 2015 to 2024 period.  Moreover, the proposed change would reduce the number of people receiving employer-based coverage by about one million, while increasing the number of uninsured.    The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care.  Since October 1, over seven million have signed up for insurance in the Health Insurance Marketplaces.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to a pre-existing medical condition now have access to coverage.  Additionally, the law helps millions of Americans stay on their parents' plans until age 26, and provides access to free preventive care like cancer screenings that catch illness early on.  While the Administration welcomes ideas to improve the law, H.R. 2575 would undermine it by shifting costs to taxpayers and causing employers either to drop or to not expand health insurance coverage.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2575, he would veto it.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration believes that carefully updating laws to facilitate cybersecurity information sharing is one of several legislative changes essential to protect individuals' privacy and improve the Nation's cybersecurity.  While there is bipartisan consensus on the need for such legislation, it should adhere to the following priorities:  (1) carefully safeguard privacy and civil liberties; (2) preserve the long-standing, respective roles and missions of civilian and intelligence agencies; and (3) provide for appropriate sharing with targeted liability protections.   The Administration recognizes and appreciates that the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) adopted several amendments to H.R. 624 in an effort to incorporate the Administration's important substantive concerns.  However, the Administration still seeks additional improvements and if the bill, as currently crafted, were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration seeks to build upon the continuing dialogue with the HPSCI and stands ready to work with members of Congress to incorporate our core priorities to produce cybersecurity information sharing legislation that addresses these critical issues.      H.R. 624 appropriately requires the Federal Government to protect privacy when handling cybersecurity information.  Importantly, the Committee removed the broad national security exemption, which significantly weakened the restrictions on how this information could be used by the government.  The Administration, however, remains concerned that the bill does not require private entities to take reasonable steps to remove irrelevant personal information when sending cybersecurity data to the government or other private sector entities.  Citizens have a right to know that corporations will be held accountable \u2013 and not granted immunity \u2013 for failing to safeguard personal information adequately.  The Administration is committed to working with all stakeholders to find a workable solution to this challenge.  Moreover, the Administration is confident that such measures can be crafted in a way that is not overly onerous or cost prohibitive on the businesses sending the information.  Further, the legislation should also explicitly ensure that cyber crime victims continue to report such crimes directly to Federal law enforcement agencies, and continue to receive the same protections that they do today.   The Administration supports the longstanding tradition to treat the Internet and cyberspace as civilian spheres, while recognizing that the Nation's cybersecurity requires shared responsibility from individual users, private sector network owners and operators, and the appropriate collaboration of civilian, law enforcement, and national security entities in government.  H.R. 624 appropriately seeks to make clear that existing public-private relationships \u2013 whether  voluntary, contractual, or regulatory \u2013 should be preserved and uninterrupted by this newly authorized information sharing.  However, newly authorized information sharing for cybersecurity purposes from the private sector to the government should enter the government through a civilian agency, the Department of Homeland Security.      Recognizing that the government will continue to receive cybersecurity information through a range of civilian, law enforcement, and national security agencies, legislation must promote appropriate sharing within the government.  As stated above, this sharing must be consistent with cybersecurity use restrictions, the cybersecurity responsibilities of the agencies involved, as well as privacy and civil liberties protections and transparent oversight.  Such intra-governmental sharing and use should not be subject to undue restrictions by the private sector companies that originally share the information. To be successful in addressing the range of cyber threats the Nation faces, it is vital that intra-governmental sharing be accomplished in as near real-time as possible.    The Administration agrees with the need to clarify the application of existing laws to remove legal barriers to the private sector sharing appropriate, well-defined, cybersecurity information.  Further, the Administration supports incentivizing industry to share appropriate cybersecurity information by providing the private sector with targeted liability protections.  However, the Administration is concerned about the broad scope of liability limitations in H.R. 624.  Specifically, even if there is no clear intent to do harm, the law should not immunize a failure to take reasonable measures, such as the sharing of information, to prevent harm when and if the entity knows that such inaction will cause damage or otherwise injure or endanger other entities or individuals.    Information sharing is one piece of a larger set of legislative requirements to provide the private sector, the Federal Government, and law enforcement with the necessary tools to combat the current and emerging cyber threats facing the Nation.  In addition to updating information sharing statutes, the Congress should incorporate privacy and civil liberties safeguards into all aspects of cybersecurity and enact legislation that:  (1) strengthens the Nation's critical infrastructure's cybersecurity by promoting the establishment and adoption of standards for critical infrastructure; (2) updates laws guiding Federal agency network security; (3) gives law enforcement the tools to fight crime in the digital age; and (4) creates a National Data Breach Reporting requirement.  * * * * * * *     2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4015, the SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act of 2014 because it includes an offset that would increase health insurance premiums, decrease tax credits, increase the number of uninsured, and shift costs to businesses, workers, and health care providers.  Rather than attempting once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which the House has tried to do over 50 times, it is time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to get into the middle class.  Medicare payments to physicians are determined under a formula, commonly referred to as the \"sustainable growth rate\" (SGR).  This formula has called for reductions in physician payment rates since 2002, which the Congress has consistently overridden for over 10 years.  Under the SGR, Medicare physician payment rates would be reduced by about 24 percent in April 2014.  The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to continue progress towards reforming Medicare physician payments to provide predictable payments that incentivize quality and efficiency in a fiscally-responsible way, and applauds the bipartisan, bicameral effort that led to the introduction of H.R. 4015 and S. 2000.  However, paying for these Medicare payment changes by reducing coverage and increasing costs for millions would reverse progress being made in making health care affordable and secure for all Americans.  The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care.  Every day, thousands of Americans are signing up for insurance, and over 4.2 million have signed up so far.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to a pre-existing medical condition now have access to coverage.  Additionally, the law helps millions of Americans stay on their parents' plans until age 26, and provides access to free preventive care like cancer screenings that catch illness early on.  H.R. 4015 would delay the individual shared responsibility provision which is essential to ensuring that the 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can get coverage without being charged more or losing coverage when they get sick.  This legislation would result in higher numbers of uninsured Americans, higher premiums for those who remain insured, and fewer premium tax credits for middle-income families, and would increase cost-shifting of uncompensated care to health care providers, workers, and businesses.

Notwithstanding the title and the stated purpose of the legislation, H.R. 761, as reported by the House Natural Resources Committee, is drafted in such a manner as to cover virtually all hardrock mining on Federal lands.  Protection of the public through sound Federal decision-making would be circumvented by the bill's provisions, which include the elimination of appropriate reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, the circumvention of public involvement in any mining proposals, and the bypassing of the formulation of alternatives to proposals, among other deleterious stipulations.  The Administration strongly supports the development of rare earth elements and other critical minerals, but rejects the notion that their development is incompatible with environmental protection and public involvement in agency decision-making.   The legislation also undermines existing law safeguarding the multiple uses of public lands by placing mining interests above all other uses.  This change has the potential to threaten hunting, fishing, recreation, and other activities that create jobs and sustain local economies across the country.  Furthermore, the Administration opposes the legislation's severe restrictions on judicial review.  Although the legislation purports to limit litigation, its extremely short statute of limitations and vague constraints on the scope of prospective relief that a court may issue are likely to have the opposite effect.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, and tailored to further statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 367, the Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2013, which would impose an unprecedented requirement that a joint resolution of approval be enacted by the Congress before any major rule of Executive Branch agencies could have force or effect.  This radical departure from the longstanding separation of powers between the Executive and Legislative branches would delay and, in many cases, thwart implementation of statutory mandates and execution of duly-enacted laws, create business uncertainty, undermine much-needed protections of the American public, and cause unnecessary confusion.  There is no justification for such an unprecedented requirement.  When a Federal agency promulgates a major rule, it must already adhere to the particular requirements of the statute that it is implementing and to the constraints imposed by other Federal statutes and the Constitution.  Indeed, in many cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the particular rule.  The agency must also comply with the rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551, et seq.).  When an agency issues a major rule, it must perform analyses of benefits and costs, analyses that are typically required by one or more statutes (such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act) as well as by Executive Orders 12866 and 13563.  In addition, this Administration has already taken numerous steps to reduce regulatory costs and to ensure that all major regulations are designed to maximize net benefits to society.  Executive Order 13563 requires careful cost-benefit analysis, public participation, harmonization of rulemaking across agencies, flexible regulatory approaches, and a regulatory retrospective review.  In addition, Executive Order 13610 further institutionalizes retrospective review by requiring agencies to report regularly on the ways they are identifying and reducing the burden of existing regulations.  Finally, agency rules are subject to the jurisdiction of Federal courts.  Moreover, for the past 17 years, the Congress itself has had the opportunity, under the Congressional Review Act of 1996, to review on an individual basis the rules \u2013 both major and non-major \u2013 that Federal agencies have issued.  By replacing this well-established framework with a blanket requirement of Congressional approval, H.R. 367 would throw all major regulations into a months-long limbo, fostering uncertainty and impeding business investment that is vital to economic growth.  Maintaining an appropriate allocation of responsibility between the two branches is essential to ensuring that the Nation's regulatory system effectively protects public health, welfare, safety, and our  environment, while also promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.  If the President were presented H.R. 367, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *  2  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3964, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act, because it would not alleviate the effects of California's current drought and would disrupt decades of work that supports building consensus, solutions, and settlements that equitably address some of California's most complex water challenges.  California is experiencing severe drought conditions and low reservoir storage.  The urgency and seriousness of the situation requires a balanced approach that promotes water reliability and ecosystem restoration.    Specifically, H.R. 3964 would undermine years of collaboration between local, State, and Federal stakeholders to develop a sound water quality control plan for the Bay-Delta.  And, contrary to current and past Federal reclamation law that defers to State water law, the bill would preempt California water law.  Moreover, much of what the bill purports to do could be accomplished through flexibilities in existing law.  The bill also would reject the long-standing principle that beneficiaries should pay both the cost of developing water supplies and of mitigating resulting development impacts, and would exacerbate current water shortages by repealing water pricing reforms that provide incentives for contractors to conserve water supplies.  Finally, H.R. 3964 would repeal the San Joaquin River Settlement Agreement, which the Congress enacted to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation.  Full repeal of the settlement agreement would likely result in the resumption of costly litigation, creating an uncertain future for river restoration and water delivery operations for water users on the San Joaquin River.  Californians are facing significant drought-related challenges.  This is why the President has directed the Federal agencies to work together to help California and other impacted States prepare for and lessen the impact of the drought.  Further, it is why the Administration strongly supports efforts to provide a more reliable water supply for California and to protect, restore, and enhance the overall quality of the Bay-Delta environment.  The Administration has taken great strides toward achieving these goals through a coordinated Federal Action Plan, which has strengthened collaboration between Federal agencies and the State of California while achieving results.  Unfortunately, H.R. 3964 would undermine these efforts and the progress that has been made.    The Administration looks forward to working with Congress on legislation to address the drought in California and supports efforts that provide water supplies consistent with existing law in the most expeditious manner to address the conditions.  These efforts would include reauthorization of the CALFED Bay-Delta Act, the Secure Water Act, and Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act.   For these reasons, if the President were presented with H.R. 3964, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * * 2  ", " ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1911, the Smarter Solutions for Students Act, which is an important step toward making college more affordable for all Americans, and commends the bipartisan effort that led to the consideration of this legislation.  It would reduce interest rates for nearly 11 million borrowers taking out new loans this school year, including those who borrowed since the rates rose on July 1st.  Also, it would cut rates on all types of borrowers this year, including those for undergraduates taking out unsubsidized Stafford loans, graduate students, and parent borrowers.  The Senate amendment does not contain the flaws that were in some of the previous legislative efforts to address this issue.  In particular, the amendment rejects a variable interest rate that resets every year, which would put students at risk of paying more over time.  Instead, it would give borrowers the certainty of a fixed interest rate on each loan to eliminate the risk of being burdened with additional costs, and would provide firm caps on how high interest rates on new student loans can rise in the future.  The amendment also rejects unfair and unwise approaches that would raise student loan interest rates to pay for deficit reduction.   There is much more to do to ensure that college tuition and student loans are affordable for the middle class and those striving to join it.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress over the upcoming year to make additional progress on these challenges, including through the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965.   * * * * * * *      ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2569, a bill that would encourage companies to invest in the United States and bring jobs back while preventing companies from receiving tax breaks for shipping jobs overseas. The Nation's tax code does too little to encourage job creation and investment in the United States while allowing firms to benefit from incentives to locate production and jobs overseas.  This bill can help attract and keep jobs in the United States by providing a 20 percent general business tax credit for eligible expenditures associated with bringing jobs back, which is paid for by preventing firms from receiving tax breaks for deducting expenses associated with outsourcing.  Senate passage of this bill is consistent with the Administration's commitment to support economic growth, job creation, and business investment in the United States, and serves to discourage outsourcing in all sectors of the economy, but particularly in the Nation's manufacturing sector.  Following a decade in which the United States lost over five million manufacturing jobs, the Nation has begun to make progress.  Since February 2010, the U.S. manufacturing sector has added more than 650,000 new jobs, the fastest pace of manufacturing job growth since the mid-1990s.  Instead of rewarding firms for shifting production and jobs overseas, the tax code should strengthen the domestic manufacturing sector, support job growth and innovation, and encourage companies from all sectors of the economy to invest in the United States.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to encourage companies to invest in America and bring jobs home.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of Senate Amendment 1974 to H.J. Res. 59, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year (FY) 2014, and for other purposes.  The Amendment allows critical Government functions to operate without interruption, providing a short-term bridge to give the Congress time to pass a budget for the remainder of the fiscal year.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on FY 2014 appropriations legislation for the full year that replaces sequestration and preserves funding for critical national priorities, protects national security, and makes investments to spur economic growth and job creation for years to come.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.    Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.  The Administration appreciates the support of the Committee in working to eliminate the threat that sexual assault in the military presents to our Service members and our national security.  Detainee Matters.  The Administration strongly objects to the provisions of sections 8107 and 8108 that limit the use of funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee transfers, which, in certain circumstances, would violate constitutional separation of powers principles.  Section 8107 undermines national security and this unnecessarily constrains the Nation's counterterrorism efforts, particularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013  option for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have leveraged the flexibility and strength of this country's Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous terrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The continued prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an essential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available option.  Additionally, the restrictions in section 8108 on the transfer of detainees to the United States and to the custody or effective control of foreign countries or entities in the context of an ongoing armed conflict may interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and to make important foreign policy and national security determinations regarding whether and under what circumstances such transfers should occur.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes section 8109, which would prohibit the use of funds to construct, acquire, or modify a detention facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This would constrain the flexibility that the Nation's Armed Forces and counterterrorism professionals need to deal with evolving threats, intruding upon the Executive Branch's ability to carry out its mission.   Topline Funding Levels.  The Administration strongly objects to unrequested Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding in the bill and the reduction of base budget funding relative to the President's request.  The FY 2014 Budget carefully aligns program priorities and resources based on the President's strategic guidance, and it fully funds OCO requirements.   Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization and funding as requested so that the Department of Defense (DOD) can right-size its infrastructure while providing appropriate transition assistance to affected communities.  Without a new round of BRAC, DOD cannot properly align the military's infrastructure with the needs of its evolving force structure, a critical tool for ensuring that limited resources are available to the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security.    TRICARE Fees and Co-Payments.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to support its proposed TRICARE fee increases, because military retirees deserve an excellent, sustainable health care benefit.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee has consistently failed to support requested TRICARE fee initiatives that seek to control DOD's spiraling health care costs while keeping retired beneficiaries' share of these costs well below the levels experienced when the TRICARE program was implemented in the mid-1990s.  While the bill restores the projected FY 2014 TRICARE savings associated with the initiatives, the Department will be forced to make deeper reductions to troop levels, readiness and modernization accounts in order to offset higher health care costs of over $8 billion through FY 2018.    Military Pay.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to include the proposal to set the military pay raise growth at 1.0 percent in FY 2014.  Consistent with the views of the uniformed military leadership, the President's Budget requests a 1.0 percent increase to basic pay, a 4.2 percent increase in the Basic Allowance for Housing, and a 3.4 percent increase in Basic Allowance for Subsistence.  This total compensation level recognizes the sacrifices made by the men and women in our Armed Forces, while adhering to the current budget constraints faced by DOD.  The bill provides $580 million in additional appropriations to fund the pay raise in FY 2014, but it would increase costs by a total of $3.5 billion from FY 2014 through FY 2018.  After FY 2014, these future costs would need to be offset by deeper reductions to troop levels, readiness and modernization accounts at a time when statutory spending caps require defense reductions.  2   Building Partner Capacity.  The Administration strongly objects to reductions in funds for programs to build partner capacity, which would limit the Department's ability to address current and emerging threats to our national security.  The bill provides $83 million less than the $358 million requested for the Global Train and Equip program and does not fund the request for $75 million for the Global Security Contingency Fund.    National Intelligence Program Consolidation.  The Administration strongly objects to section 8105 because the provision's prohibitions would impinge on the President's prerogatives to seek efficient budget structures and unduly constrain the President in future budget decisions.   Unrequested Funding.  The Administration is concerned about the billions of dollars provided for items DOD did not request and does not need, such as Light Utility Helicopters, National Guard High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWV), additional medical research, and the modernization of seven cruisers and two amphibious ships.  The Administration is also concerned that the bill makes spending on these and other unnecessary items statutorily required, diverting scarce resources from more important defense programs and limiting the Secretary's flexibility to manage the Department efficiently.   C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (C-130 AMP).  The Administration objects to the $47 million in unrequested funding provided for the C-130 AMP, which would start initial production of C-130 AMP kits for the modernization of earlier generation C-130 airlift aircraft.  The President's FY 2013 Budget canceled the C-130 AMP because of its high total program cost of $2.7 billion, and because the aircraft would still be able to perform their missions with less expensive upgrades.  In addition, as required by the FY 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, DOD is conducting an independent cost-benefit analysis of the C-130 AMP, and it would be premature to reinstate the program before that study is complete.   Advanced Innovative Technologies.  The Administration objects to the $115 million cut for Advanced Innovative Technologies, an 88 percent reduction from the President's request, which funds on-going research and development efforts that support the new Defense Strategy and the rebalance to the Asia Pacific.  Specifically, this program supports initiatives that would provide cost-effective and cost-imposing capabilities that are critical for meeting the Combatant Commander's objectives in the region.  This capability is needed to address real world threats and full funding is required to research, develop and test performance of the Electromagnetic Railgun system.  Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund (JUONF).  The Administration objects to the elimination of funding requested for the JUONF.  This funding is critical to DOD's ability to quickly respond to urgent operational needs of Combatant Commanders.  Elimination of funding may delay fielding of important capabilities that help accomplish critical missions.    Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Programs.  The Administration objects to the restoration of funding for the STARBASE program, which would perpetuate the Federal Government's fragmented approach to STEM education, whereby more than 220 programs are scattered across 13 agencies.  The Administration's proposed reorganization of STEM programs would improve STEM education quality and outcomes across the Federal Government.     3  Defense Acquisition Workforce Development Fund (DAWDF).  The Administration opposes the reduction of $205 million from the FY 2014 Budget request for the DAWDF.  Failure to provide the full request would require DOD to collect the shortfall between the appropriation and the statutory minimum for DAWDF from other budget accounts.  In addition, the Administration opposes appropriations language that would not allow use of prior year expired funds for the   FY 2014 DAWDF collection.  Components should be allowed to use these funds per the authority provided in current law.    Civilian Pay Raise.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for Federal civilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.    Missile Defense.  The Administration appreciates the support for DOD's air and missile defense programs, as well as support for the government of Israel's Iron Dome rocket system.    Afghanistan Security Forces Fund.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued strong support for U.S. efforts to build and develop the security forces of Afghanistan.  However, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to make $2.6 billion of the $7.7 billion request contingent upon pending policy decisions and the progress made by the Afghan National Security Forces during FY 2014, as requested in the President's Budget.  Limitation on Funds Available to Procure Equipment.  The Administration appreciates the support of the Committee for a responsive and flexible program to train and equip the security forces of Afghanistan.  However, the Administration is concerned that some of the limitations proposed in section 8119 will prevent the Department from meeting critical equipment requirements and delivery timelines for the Afghan National Security Forces and will unnecessarily increase costs for the U.S. taxpayer.  The Administration urges the Congress to work with the Department to develop an alternative approach.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *   4  ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 2244, which amends the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program through December 31, 2021, while making reforms to further reduce taxpayer exposure, increase private sector contributions, and better position the Program for future transition to the private sector.   Established in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Program provides a Federal backstop that promotes the capacity of the private insurance market to insure losses resulting from acts of terror.  Terrorism insurance is necessary for a broad range of economic activities in areas across the country, and would be prohibitively expensive or unavailable in the absence of the Program.  Since it was first established in 2003, the Program has effectively kept terrorism insurance available and affordable so that American businesses can secure necessary coverage, thereby promoting economic growth and employment opportunities for American workers. Reauthorizing the Program will ensure that the American economy remains resilient against the threat of terrorism.  The Administration supports swift passage of this legislation and looks forward to working with Congress on this reauthorization and reform process.    * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4, which incorporates several bills that have previously been passed by the House during this Congress, including a number of bills for which the Administration issued Statements of Administration Policy strongly opposing passage and indicating that, if presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto them.     The Administration wants to work with Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen the economy and help middle class families, including pro-growth business tax reform.  The Administration continues to support tax proposals that would benefit the Nation\u2019s economy and small businesses, such as making permanent the research and experimentation tax credit and increased expensing for small businesses.  However, making traditional tax extenders and costly business tax cuts permanent without offsets, while at the same time allowing taxes to increase on 26 million working families, represents the wrong approach.  In addition, the Administration welcomes ideas to improve the Affordable Care Act.  However, H.R. 4 would undermine that Act by shifting costs to taxpayers and causing fewer Americans to have employer-sponsored health insurance coverage.   Also, the Administration is committed to ensuring that the benefits of regulation justify their costs and that they are tailored to advance statutory goals in a manner that is efficient, is cost-effective, and minimizes uncertainty.  However, H.R. 4 would throw all major regulations into a months-long limbo, marking a significant departure from the longstanding separation of powers between the Executive and Legislative branches and, fostering uncertainty and impeding business investment that is vital to economic growth.  Furthermore, the bill would impose other unnecessary requirements on agencies that would seriously undermine their ability to execute their statutory mandates.  Finally, the Administration is committed to sound long-term management of Federal lands for continued productivity and economic benefit, as well as for the long-term health of the wildlife and ecological values sustained by these holdings.  However, H.R. 4 includes numerous harmful provisions that would impair responsible management of Federally-owned lands and undermine many important existing public land and environmental laws, rules, and processes.  If the President were presented with H.R. 4, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports making permanent expanded expensing for small businesses and offsetting the cost by closing tax loopholes.  Enhanced small business expensing supports small businesses in making investments and creating jobs.  Small businesses employ half of the Nation\u2019s workforce and create nearly two out of every three jobs.    However, as with other similar proposals, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4457, which would permanently extend and expand the current expensing provisions for small businesses without offsetting the cost, adding to long-run deficits.    By making expanded expensing for small business permanent without offsets, H.R. 4457 would add $73 billion to the deficit over the next ten years.  Moreover, if this unprecedented approach of making major traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets were followed for the other traditional tax extenders, it would add $500 billion or more to deficits, wiping out most of the deficit reduction achieved through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2013.  Just two months ago, House Republicans passed a budget resolution that required offsets for any tax extenders that were made permanent with other revenue measures.    With this legislation, Republicans are imposing a double standard by adding to the deficit to fund tax breaks for businesses, while insisting on offsetting the cost of measures that help middle-class and working Americans.  The cost of H.R. 4457 is many times the cost of the proposed extension of emergency unemployment benefits, which House Republicans insist be offset, and more than the discretionary funding increases for defense and non-defense priorities such as research and development in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which were offset.  House Republicans also are making clear their priorities by rushing to make business tax cuts permanent without offsets even as the House Republican budget resolution calls for raising taxes on 25 million working families and students by letting important improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and education tax credits expire.    The Administration wants to work with Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen the economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax reform.

It unwinds some of the damaging cuts caused by sequestration, ensures the continuation of critical services that the American people depend on, and invests in essential areas such as education, infrastructure, manufacturing, and scientific research, which contribute to growing the economy, creating jobs, and strengthening the middle class.  Further, H.R. 3547 is a positive step forward that helps return the budget process to regular order.

VAWA transformed the Nation's response to violence against women and brought critically needed resources to States and local communities to address these crimes.   The Administration is pleased that S. 47 continues that bipartisan progress and targets resources to address today\u02c8s most pressing issues.  Sexual assault remains one of the most underreported violent crimes in the country.  The bill provides funding through State grants to improve the criminal justice response to sexual assault and to better connect victims with services.  Further, the bill seeks to reduce domestic violence homicides and address the high rates of violence experienced by teens and young adults.  Reaching young people through early intervention can break the cycle of violence.  The Administration strongly supports measures in S. 47 that will bring justice to Native American victims.  Rates of domestic violence against Native American women are now among the highest in the United States.  The bill builds on the Tribal Law and Order Act \u2013 which President Obama signed on July 29, 2010 \u2013 to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of tribal justice systems and also recognizes tribal authorities with respect to domestic violence in Indian country.  The Administration is pleased that S. 47 recognizes the need to provide protection and services to all victims of abuse and includes proposals to strengthen existing policies that were supported by both Democrats and Republicans last year. * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports S. 743, which will level the playing field for local small business retailers that are in competition every day with large out-of-state online companies.  Although States presently have the authority to tax the sale of goods or services sold from out-of-state vendors, they are prevented under current law from requiring the collection of such duly-enacted taxes.  As a consequence, while local small business retailers follow the law and collect sales taxes from customers who make purchases in their stores, many big business online and catalog retailers do not collect the same taxes.  Because these out-of-state companies are able to play by a different set of rules, this disparity undermines the ability of cities and States to invest in K-12 education, police and fire protection, access to affordable health care, and funding for roads and bridges.  This bill would eliminate the unfair advantage currently enjoyed by big out-of-state online companies over local neighborhood-based small businesses.  In recent years, collection technologies have improved and States have made significant strides to cut red tape and simplify their tax systems.  At the same time, Internet-facilitated sales continue to grow as a share of total transactions, contributing to ongoing State budget pressures.  In recognition of these developments, a broad and growing group of bipartisan State and Federal leaders \u2014 including governors, mayors, business and labor groups, and members of Congress from both parties \u2014 has called for commonsense Federal legislation to make the system more fair.    The Administration strongly supports provisions in S. 743 that would directly address those concerns by granting only those States and localities that have simplified their sales tax systems the option to require all retailers, including those located out-of-state, to collect sales and use taxes already owed under law.  The Administration also is pleased that S. 743 provides an exception for small online businesses and requires States to make available, at no cost to retailers, software that helps calculate the State sales tax on remote transactions, as well as administrative services.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this bipartisan legislation to support State and local priorities and promote a level playing field for local retailers.    * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3362 because it would require unfunded, unprecedented, and unnecessary reporting requirements of Health Insurance Marketplaces that exceed those of other public and private programs.  The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care and has already improved many aspects of the Nation's health care system.  Beginning this year, millions of low- and middle-income Americans will be eligible to receive tax credits to help them purchase insurance and cost-sharing reductions to help with out-of-pocket expenses for coverage.  Tens of millions of Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions will now be covered.  The nearly one in two Americans under the age of 65 with pre-existing medical conditions will have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they cannot be dropped from their health plan or denied coverage because of those conditions.  H.R. 3362 would add extraneous, costly, and unprecedented reporting requirements on States and the Federal Government.  It would require the reporting of data on a weekly basis that is generally being provided on a monthly basis.  Few major indicators \u2013 from job growth to Medicare Advantage enrollment to private shareholder reports \u2013 are provided more frequently than monthly; this bill would hold the Marketplaces and State Medicaid programs to unprecedented standards.  To implement this new reporting system, contracts may need to be modified and new staff would need to be hired on an expedited basis, adding millions of dollars in costs to States and the Federal Government, without additional funding from the Congress, for information that is already largely being provided on a monthly basis, consistent with other publicly-funded health care programs.  As such, the Administration opposes its passage.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4800, making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes.  The bill undermines key investments in financial oversight, injects political decision-making into science-based nutrition standards, and includes objectionable language riders.  If the President were presented with H.R. 4800, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations process that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding unnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include reconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and national security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an orderly appropriations process.   The President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our national security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same time, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to deliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.  The President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels\u2014increasing rental assistance for rural families, supporting critical nutrition programs for mothers and young children, and providing resources to implement the critical financial protections established in the Wall Street Reform Act.  However, the levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation and are not sufficient\u2014either in FY 2015 or beyond\u2014to ensure the Nation is achieving its full potential.  For that reason, the Budget also includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative\u2014evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities\u2014that presents additional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would support over $270 million in priority research in areas such as advanced genetics, earth science, and climate change resilience.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve these issues during the FY 2015 appropriations process.  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  Child Nutrition.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that would require the Secretary to establish a waiver process to eliminate current nutrition requirements for school breakfasts and lunches during the 2014-2015 school year for any school or district that demonstrates a net operating loss on school meals for at least six months beginning in July 2013.    This would be a major step backwards for the health of American children by undermining the effort to provide kids with more nutritious food.  More generally, the Administration strongly opposes the inclusion of any language in the bill that would override science-based standards that improve child nutrition.   Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).  The Administration is strongly opposed to language in the bill that would require the inclusion of white potatoes in the WIC food package, while taking the unprecedented step of overriding the science-based review process used to determine which foods should be included in the WIC food package.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides sufficient funding to serve all projected WIC participants for FY 2015, but urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2015 Budget request for $150 million in contingency funds to ensure that the program has sufficient resources to meet unexpected changes in participation.   Child Nutrition School Equipment Grants.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support for school meals equipment grants, but urges the Congress to fully fund the FY 2015 Budget request of $35 million to help school districts purchase the equipment needed to serve healthier meals, improve food safety, expand access to meals, and improve energy efficiency.    Healthy Food Financing Initiative (HFFI).  The Administration is concerned that the Committee did not provide the requested $13 million for the newly authorized HFFI program in the most recent Farm Bill.  This program would be used to support increased access to healthy foods in underserved areas, create and preserve quality jobs, and revitalize low income communities.   Food Aid Reform.  The Administration is concerned that the bill excludes food aid reforms proposed in the President's Budget that would support two million more people in crises without additional resources. The bill also eliminates some flexible food purchase authority provided in the FY 2014 appropriations process.  Further, by raising the non-emergency food aid floor to $375 million from the level in the most recent Farm Bill, the bill reduces the amount that would otherwise be available for emergency food aid.  At a time when major food crises are increasing, including those in South Sudan and Syria, these reforms are critically needed.   National Institute of Food and Agriculture.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee included no funding to support the three research innovation institutes, as requested in the FY 2015 Budget, and recommended by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.  These institutes would provide competitive grants to support public-private cooperation for pollinator health research, advanced manufacturing, and anti-microbial resistance, all important issues facing the Nation.    Rental Assistance Grant Program.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funds Rental Assistance Grants at $1.1 billion.  The Administration encourages the Congress to    2  adopt all of the funding flexibilities proposed in the FY 2015 Budget in order to improve the management and efficiency of the program.    Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) Demonstration.  The Administration appreciates the Committee providing $27 million to support summer EBT pilots, consistent with the President's policy.  These pilots are proving successful in reducing childhood hunger and improving nutrition in the months when school meals are unavailable.    Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  FDA Rulemaking Rider.  The Administration strongly opposes provisions that unduly interfere with FDA's rulemaking process.  The bill includes a general provision that withholds $20 million from FDA's Salaries and Expenses account until FDA issues final guidance on abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids.  FDA is committed to publishing final guidance in a timely manner once comments received on the draft guidance have been considered.  Withholding funds until the final guidance is published would limit FDA's ability to dedicate staff and resources appropriately and could have far-reaching negative impacts on FDA's public health mission.    User Fees.  The Administration continues to support new proposed user fees that would provide vital resources to enhance FDA's capacity to support a prevention-based food safety system and urges the Congress to enact these user fees as proposed in the FY 2015 Budget request.    Other Agencies  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The Administration strongly opposes the $62 million reduction in funding from the FY 2015 Budget request for CFTC.  The further reduction to the amount available for salaries and other general expenses would reduce the number of CFTC staff and significantly impede the Commission's ability to perform its market oversight functions and fully implement enacted financial reforms to protect investors.    Civilian Pay Raise  The Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for Federal civilian employees to help the Government remain competitive in attracting and retaining our Federal workforce.  A 1.0 percent civilian pay increase reflects the tight budget constraints that we continue to face, while also recognizing the critical role civilian employees play for the Nation\u2014doing everything from assuring the safety of our food and airways, to securing our borders, to searching for cures to diseases.  It also recognizes the sacrifices they have already made through prior pay freezes and last year's furloughs due to sequestration.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  3  ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3309, as reported with a strong, bipartisan vote by the House Judiciary Committee.  The bill builds on the important patent reforms contained in the America Invents Act (P.L. 112-29) and successfully implemented by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  The bill would improve incentives for future innovation while protecting the overall integrity of the patent system.    On June 4, 2013, the Administration recommended seven legislative measures to the Congress designed to protect innovators from frivolous litigation and ensure the highest-quality patents.  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of many of these measures in H.R. 3309 and supports the bill\u2019s provisions to require disclosures in patent infringement cases, streamline actions involving end-users, and provide educational resources for small businesses.  By reducing unnecessary costs of patent litigation, it also represents significant progress on the efforts to level the playing field for small innovators.  The Administration supports the effort to discourage abusive court filings, but hopes that, as final legislation is crafted, appropriate recognition is given to the importance of judicial discretion in balancing competing interests.  Finally, the Administration continues to have concerns about the bill\u2019s provisions on post-issuance review proceedings, including those pertaining to patent claim construction.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to advance this important bipartisan legislation and to include additional provisions that the Administration recommended to help protect innovators, including transparency of demand letters and pre-litigation patent ownership.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 4138 because it violates the separation of powers by purporting to permit the Congress to challenge in court the exercise by the President of one of his core constitutional functions \u2013 taking care that Federal laws are faithfully executed.     Congress ordinarily has the power to define the bounds of the Executive Branch's enforcement authority under particular statutes, and persons who claim to be harmed by the Executive Branch's actions may challenge them as inconsistent with the governing statute.  But the power the bill purports to assign to Congress to sue the President over whether he has properly discharged his constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed exceeds constitutional limitations.  Congress may not assign such power to itself, nor may it assign to the courts the task of resolving such generalized political disputes.         If the President were presented with H.R. 4138, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports investing in the Nation's water resources to build the foundation for long-term economic growth, to address significant risks to public safety, and to protect and restore our environment.  The Administration's key policies and principles will help meet our Nation's water resources challenges in a fiscally responsible way.  The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3080 as it would advance some of these policies and principles, but it should be improved with additional reforms and modifications of problematic provisions.  Currently, the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) has a $60 billion construction backlog and increasing operation and maintenance costs of existing infrastructure.  The Administration supports provisions in the bill to de-authorize projects that no longer meet the Nation's needs or have become too costly.  The bill, however, would authorize the Corps to construct several new projects that the Administration has not recommended for authorization due to their marginal return on investment or other concerns.  The Administration would like to work with Congress on authorizations of projects and studies that provide high economic and environmental returns to the Nation, or address a significant risk to public safety, within the Corps' three main missions: flood and storm damage reduction; commercial navigation; and aquatic ecosystem restoration.  Creating and maintaining our Nation's water resources infrastructure is a shared responsibility between federal and non-federal beneficiaries and requires that the management, use, protection, and restoration of our water resources continue to evolve to meet the Nation's future needs.  H.R. 3080 would enable non-federal parties to move forward with certain water resources projects on their own more easily.  However, it would also weaken key reforms enacted by the Congress in the landmark Water Resources Development Act of 1986.  For example, the bill would shift significant costs to the taxpayer that are now the responsibility of barge operators on inland waterways, and would expand the Federal role in the maintenance of coastal ports to areas that have historically been a non-federal responsibility.  The Administration is concerned that the project permitting and delivery provisions in H.R. 3080 may slow project approval and do not adequately protect communities, taxpayers, or the environment.  The Administration appreciates the omission of financial penalty provisions for agencies; however, the bill includes provisions that could constrain science-based decision making, increase litigation risk, and undermine the integrity of several foundational environmental laws, including the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act.  The Administration is making significant progress to improve the efficiency of Federal permitting and reviews in a manner that encourages early collaboration, stakeholder engagement and better environmental outcomes while not jeopardizing bedrock environmental laws.  The Administration urges the House to reaffirm the  current foundational environmental review framework for all water resources projects that fosters transparency, informed decision-making, and strong environmental outcomes, and to encourage the Corps to continue efforts to evaluate the full range of reasonable alternatives, including the use of natural infrastructure where appropriate, and to promote better environmental stewardship.  The Administration supports efforts to enhance resilience in light of future risks of substantial storm and flood damage, including from a changing climate.  Federal policies and investments should encourage and incentivize improved management of water and related land resources at the local level to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance the resiliency and natural functions of floodplains and coastal areas and the communities in them, advance public safety, and promote efforts to preserve and restore aquatic ecosystems.  The Administration also urges reform of the laws governing the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, which a proposal in the President\u2019s FY 2014 Budget would accomplish.  The proposal would establish an annual per vessel fee to raise $1.1 billion in additional revenue over 10 years from the commercial users of the inland waterways.  It would support economic growth, and reflect actual costs incurred by the Corps on their behalf.  * * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of S. 2199, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would significantly strengthen the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and give women additional tools to fight pay discrimination.  Today, women represent almost half of the workforce and, in many cases, are either the sole or primary source of income for their family.  Despite their increased presence in the workforce and increasingly important role as family breadwinner, women continue to earn substantially less than their male counterparts, and the pay discrepancy is even more dire for women of color.  The gender wage gap not only hurts working families, it also undermines the Administration's commitment to expand opportunity for all Americans.   The Paycheck Fairness Act represents a significant step forward to address pay disparities and other obstacles that continue to harm the advancement of women in our economy.  For example, the legislation would enhance the enforcement of equal pay laws by prohibiting retaliation against employees who ask about or discuss wage information, and by providing more effective remedies for women subjected to discriminatory pay practices.  S. 2199 would strengthen the Equal Pay Act by closing judicially-created loopholes for employer defenses and by bringing its class action rules into conformity with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  S. 2199 would also strengthen the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's enforcement of laws prohibiting pay discrimination, and facilitate voluntary employer compliance, by requiring the collection of pay data.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3102, the Nutrition Reform and Work Opportunity Act of 2013. The bill would result in millions of Americans losing access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is one of our nation\u2019s strongest defenses against hunger and poverty.  These cuts would affect a broad array of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet, including working families with children, senior citizens, veterans, and adults who are still looking for work.  Slashing SNAP also weakens our nation\u2019s farm and rural economies. Congress should approach the reauthorization of the Farm Bill in a comprehensive manner. The Administration has called for the enactment of a multi-year Farm Bill that supports rural America while achieving significant deficit reduction.  The President\u2019s Budget proposes specific balanced reforms that would accomplish this goal without creating hardship for vulnerable Americans. The Administration urges Congress to follow that path and reject the harmful cuts contained in H.R. 3102.

Rather than attempting once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which the House has tried nearly 40 times, it's time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to get into the middle class.  The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care and has already improved many aspects of the Nation's health care system.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, tens of millions of Americans who have previously been denied coverage due to a pre-existing medical condition will now be covered.  The nearly one in two Americans under the age of 65 with            pre-existing medical conditions will have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they can't be dropped from their health plan or denied coverage because of those conditions. House passage of H.R. 2667 and H.R. 2668 will undermine this security for tens of millions of Americans with        pre-existing conditions.  H.R. 2667 is unnecessary, and H.R. 2668 would raise health insurance premiums and increase the number of uninsured Americans.  Enacting this legislation would undermine key elements of the health law, facilitating further efforts to repeal a law that is already helping millions of Americans stay on their parents' plans until age 26, millions more who are getting free preventive care that catches illness early on, and thousands of children with pre-existing conditions who are now covered.

Res. 59, he would veto the bill.  The Administration is willing to support a short-term continuing resolution to allow critical Government functions to operate without interruption and looks forward to working with the Congress on appropriations legislation for the remainder of the fiscal year that preserves critical national priorities, protects national security, and makes investments to spur economic growth and job creation for years to come.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2954, which is an omnibus lands bill incorporating ten separate House bills.  The Administration has worked to protect and manage the responsible use of America's natural resources and to support and ensure that the Nation's spectacular landscapes, unique natural life, and cultural resources and icons endure for future generations.  The Administration is working, through balanced and community-based decision-making, to maximize the value of the outdoors for all Americans.    Overall, H.R. 2954 contains a number of provisions that would undermine the responsible balance of interests and considerations in the stewardship of the Nation's lands and natural resources.  Further, provisions of the bill would disregard or reduce public engagement on a range of community interests, including natural resource protections, and preclude agencies from considering less environmentally detrimental alternatives.  Most significantly, H.R. 2954 would:  (1) waive all Federal laws, including those that require consultation with Federal, State, local, or tribal governments or with local residents, in order to expedite timber harvests on certain Federal lands in California; (2) reverse course on the science-based National Park Service plan, developed after a lengthy public engagement process, that provides an appropriate balance of off-road vehicle access and protection of sensitive seashore areas in North Carolina; and (3) waive review under the National Environmental Policy Act for certain actions, weakening important public involvement and planning provisions for actions affecting resources such as grazing on lands managed by the Department of the Interior.  Among other concerns, the bill would:  (1) remove the protection for lands that provide natural storm barriers vital to wildlife habitat and public recreation in Florida; (2) set a troubling precedent for the management of the use of hand-propelled vessels in Yellowstone and Grand Tetons National Parks; and (3) convey a Federal interest in land in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, without compensation to the U.S. Treasury.

Like the proposal in the President's FY 2014 Budget, this bill would give students the certainty of fixed interest rates, would not raise student loan interest rates for deficit reduction, and would support low- and middle-income students who struggle most to afford a college education.   The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress on a bipartisan approach to a long-term solution that will help students and families afford higher education now and in the future, will not raise student rates to reduce the deficit, and will provide students protection against unaffordable loan balances and market uncertainties in the years to come.

However, the Administration has serious concerns with the substitute amendment to the Senate-passed version of S. 2244 considered by the House Rules Committee.  The Administration strongly opposes the inclusion of modifications to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, specifically the end user provision, in this TRIA-related bill that has broad bipartisan support.  Broadening Dodd-Frank\u2019s statutory exemptions is a complicated issue with serious implications for the health and stability of the Nation\u2019s financial markets.  The main purpose of S. 2244 is to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; this bill should not be used as a vehicle to add entirely unrelated financial regulatory provisions. The Administration supports the policy goals of Title II, which would establish a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB) as a mechanism for individuals and companies that sell insurance to be licensed to sell insurance in States other than their home State without having to be separately licensed in each State. The Administration, however, is concerned that the bill provides a process for conducting criminal history records checks on individuals applying to become members of NARAB that is inconsistent with the normal process the FBI uses to conduct thousands of such background checks. The Administration believes the bill can be made consistent with current law in order to assure the benefits of an efficient and effective established process.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 982, which would require trusts set up through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization caused by asbestos liabilities to:  (1) file a publicly available quarterly report with the bankruptcy court that would include personal information about individuals who have filed claims asserting asbestos-related injuries, including their names, exposure history, and basis for any payment made to them; and (2) provide any information related to payment from and demands for payment from such trust to any party to any action in law or equity concerning liability for asbestos exposure.  The legislation is based on the false assertion that there is endemic fraud in the asbestos trust system.  The bill\u2019s mandatory reporting and disclosure requirements would threaten asbestos victims\u2019 privacy when they seek payment for injuries from an asbestos bankruptcy trust.  Claimants\u2019 sensitive personal information \u2013 including their names and exposure histories \u2013 would be irretrievably released into the public domain and thus available to parties unrelated to the claims (including insurance companies, prospective employers, lenders, and data collectors).  These parties could then use this personal information for purposes entirely unrelated to compensation for asbestos exposure, potentially to the detriment of asbestos victims.  The information on this public registry could be used to deny employment, credit, and insurance.  Victims would be more vulnerable to identity thieves and other types of predators.  These requirements could be particularly harmful to veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States, who have been disproportionately affected by asbestos.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 5781 because it fails to equitably address critical elements of California's complex water challenges.  The Administration appreciates the efforts by the bill authors to address concerns raised by the Administration regarding H.R. 3964, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act.  However, because H.R. 5781 makes operational determinations regarding the use of limited water resources during the ongoing drought, and contains many new provisions that could lead to unintended consequences or further litigation, the Administration cannot support the bill in its current form. The Administration takes seriously the ongoing drought that has affected communities, producers and water users across much of the country, including the especially hard hit State of California. Since the President\u2019s visit to Fresno, California earlier this year the Administration has undertaken a number of steps to help those most affected by drought. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has directed millions of dollars in food, conservation and emergency water assistance to tens of thousands of residents in areas hardest hit by drought. The Bureau of Reclamation has provided cost-share assistance for nine water reclamation and reuse projects in the State as well as millions of dollars in grants to build long-term resiliency to drought. Moreover, the President has directed Federal agencies to work with state and local officials in real-time to maximize limited water supplies, prioritize public health and safety, meet state water quality requirements, and ensure a balanced approach to providing for the water needs of people, agriculture, businesses, power, imperiled species and the environment.  Among other things, these efforts took form in a 2014 Drought Operations Plan, prepared in close coordination with the State, and the Administration is already taking steps to prepare a new drought plan for 2015 based on lessons learned and the best available science during the current year.  H.R. 5781 was introduced on December 2 and is being considered in the few remaining days of this session without a hearing or opportunity for the public to review and provide comment.  In particular, the bill appears to include a number of potentially conflicting mandates which can create confusion and undermine environmental laws, making it ripe for future litigation.  Given the complexity of California water issues, policy determinations over the use of scarce water resources should be developed in an open and transparent manner, with an ability for the public, affected stakeholders, and Federal, state and local officials to review and provide comment and feedback.  The Administration stands ready to work with Congress in this regard. For these reasons, if the President were presented with H.R. 5781, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of piecemeal fiscal year 2014 appropriations legislation that restores only very limited activities. Consideration of appropriations bills in this fashion is not a serious or responsible way to run the United States Government.  Instead of opening up a few Government functions, the House of Representatives should re-open all of the Government.  The harmful impacts of a shutdown extend across Government, affecting services that are critical to small businesses, women, children, seniors, and others across the Nation.  The Senate acted in a responsible manner on a short-term funding measure to maintain Government functions and avoid a damaging Government shutdown.  The House of Representatives should allow a straight up or down vote on the Senate-passed H.J. Res. 59.  If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 75, H.J. Res. 76, H.J. Res. 77, H.J.

The Administration appreciates the bill's continued support for providing funding that assists the warfighter in operating in unconventional and irregular warfare and countering unconventional threats, supports capacity-building efforts with foreign military forces, and supports on-going operations, as well as the support for programs that would improve the health and well-being of the force, including sexual assault prevention.  While there are a number of areas of agreement with the bill, the Administration has serious concerns with provisions that would constrain the ability of the Department of Defense (DOD) to align military capabilities and force structure with the President's defense strategy and to reduce unneeded costs.    The Administration will soon submit a budget amendment to request funding for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  This request will reflect the President\u2019s decision on troop levels in Afghanistan and include funding for the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan, DOD's supporting presence in the broader region, as well as the recently proposed Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund and European Reassurance Initiative.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this request.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations process that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding unnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include reconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and national security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an orderly appropriations process.   The President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our national security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same time, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to deliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.    The President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels.  However, the levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation and are not sufficient\u2013either in FY 2015 or beyond\u2013to ensure the Nation is achieving its full potential.  For that reason, the Budget also includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and  Security Initiative\u2013evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities\u2013that presents additional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would provide $26.4 billion for DOD to make progress on restoring readiness lost under sequestration, accelerate modernization of key weapons systems, and improve DOD facilities across the United States.  In the Administration's view, the risk to the Nation will grow significantly should the Congress not accept reforms proposed in the FY 2015 Budget.  Without congressional support for meaningful compensation reforms and other cost saving measures, force structure changes, and flexibility to manage weapon systems and infrastructure, there is an increased risk to the Department's ability to implement the President's defense strategy, which will contribute to a military that will be less capable of responding effectively to future challenges.    The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve these issues during the FY 2015 appropriations process.    Department of Defense  Prohibition on Retirement, Divesture, Realignment, or Transfer of Aircraft.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support of the Air Force's A-10 fleet divesture plans.  Divesting the A-10 fleet will help the Air Force meet near-term readiness and achieve long-term modernization objectives.  However, the Administration strongly objects to provisions that restrict the Department's ability to retire other weapon systems and aircraft platforms in accordance with current strategic and operational plans.  These divestitures are critical and would provide funding for higher priority programs.  Specifically, the Administration strongly objects to sections 8122, 8133, and 8136 of the bill, consistent with previously stated objections to provisions in the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act.  Section 8122 of the bill would prohibit the cancellation or modification of the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP).  DOD plans to replace the C-130 AMP with a less expensive, fully capable alternative that has been validated by independent study to ensure that the fleet continues to meet future requirements.  Section 8133 would prevent the Air Force from using funds to divest or to disestablish any units of the active or reserve component associated with E-3 airborne warning and control system aircraft.  This provision would force the Air Force to take funding from higher priority defense needs in order to operate, sustain, and maintain aircraft that are not needed and are unaffordable in today's constrained fiscal environment.  Section 8136, which limits the transfer of Apaches from the Army National Guard to the active Army, would result in gaps in the Army's armed reconnaissance units that would require approximately $4 billion to fill.  As DOD transitions out of a decade of war, aircraft force structure changes are necessary to shape a force that is more agile and ready to respond to the requirements of the defense strategy.    Compensation Reform.  To achieve a proper balance between DOD's obligation to provide competitive pay and benefits to servicemembers and its responsibility to provide troops with the training and equipment they need to do their jobs, it is imperative to slow the growth of basic pay and housing allowances, modernize military healthcare, and reform how commissaries operate.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to support these reforms, which would save $2 2  billion in FY 2015 and $31 billion through FY 2019.  While the Committee restored funding to offset the FY 2015 savings associated with proposals that were not supported, the rejection of these proposals will likely require DOD to find over $27 billion in additional reductions to readiness, modernization, and force structure for FY 2016 through FY 2019.  The Administration looks forward to the recommendations of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission on long-term compensation and retirement issues, but delaying DOD's holistic package of proposed initial changes will only result in increased costs, degradation in training and modernization efforts, and risks to the force.   Guant\u00e1namo Detainee Restrictions.  The Administration strongly objects to sections 8107, 8108, 8139, and 9015 of the bill, each of which would restrict the Executive Branch's ability to manage the Guant\u00e1namo detainee population.  The President has repeatedly objected to the inclusion of these or similar provisions in prior legislation and this year has reiterated his call to the Congress to lift such restrictions.  As the President said in his State of the Union Address, \"this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\"  Operating the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging our relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent extremists.  These provisions are unwarranted and threaten to interfere with the Executive Branch's ability to determine the appropriate disposition of detainees and its flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute Guant\u00e1namo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests.  Sections 8107, 8139, and 9015 would, moreover, violate constitutional separation-of-powers principles under certain circumstances.    Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).  The Administration strongly objects to the proposed $4.8 million reduction in funds that would support a BRAC 2017 round.  This impairs the ability of the Executive Branch to plan for contingencies or make other needed adjustments that would improve military effectiveness and efficiency.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the BRAC authorization and funding as requested, which would allow DOD to rightsize its infrastructure while providing important assistance to affected communities.  Without authorization for a new round of BRAC, DOD will not be able to properly align the military's infrastructure with the needs of our evolving force structure, which is critical to ensuring that limited resources are available for the highest priorities of the warfighter and national security.    Limitation on Funds Available to Procure Equipment.  The Administration objects to section 8116 of the bill which would continue and expand prohibitions on using funds to procure certain equipment, including maintenance for the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).  This section would severely limit DOD's ability to sustain military-use helicopters and other equipment that is already in ANSF's inventory and is critical to their ability to continue the fight against extremists who threaten the security of Afghanistan, the United States, and our allies.  If enacted, this section could force DOD to seek more costly alternatives than contracting with the Russian helicopter industry to sustain ANSF aircraft, increasing costs to the U.S. taxpayer.    Liquid Rocket Engine Development.  The Administration objects to the unrequested $220 million for a new rocket engine.  An independent study recently concluded that such a program would take eight years to field and could cost $1.5 billion with another $3 billion needed to develop a suitable launch vehicle.  This approach prematurely commits significant resources and would not 3  reduce our reliance on Russian engines for at least a decade.  With a goal of promptly reducing our reliance on Russian technology, the Administration is evaluating several cost-effective options including public-private partnerships with multiple awards that will drive innovation, stimulate the industrial base, and reduce costs through competition.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this issue once the analysis is complete.   Limitations on Phased Modernization of Weapon Systems.  While appreciative of the bill's overall support for cruiser modernization, the Administration objects to the unnecessary limitations on the current plan, which would preclude modernization in the most cost effective and timely manner and may hinder the Navy's ability to retain 11 modernized cruisers into the 2040s.    Reducing the Force Structure at Lajes Air Force Base.  The Administration objects to section 8123 of the bill, which would prohibit the Secretary of the Air Force from reducing the force structure at Lajes Air Force Base and is duplicative of section 341 of the FY 2014 National Defense Authorization Act.  Because DOD is nearing completion of the section 341 requirements for Lajes, duplicating and amplifying these requirements is unnecessarily onerous.    Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).  The Administration objects to funding reductions for the LCS program.  The reductions leave the program with insufficient funds to procure three LCS in  FY 2015, delaying the delivery of much needed capability to the Fleet.  Deferring additional ships into FY 2016 would compound the already significant challenges the Navy faces in funding the shipbuilding account in a fiscally constrained environment while increasing overall costs to the Navy and increasing risk to the industrial base, including sub-tier suppliers.  Reallocation of Missile Defense Agency Funding.  The Administration objects to the reallocation of $370 million from the FY 2015 Budget request.  These changes would reduce capability and capacity, and may possibly hinder the Department's ability to effectively manage the Agency.  Specifically, this reallocation of funds would delay critical engineering, testing, command and control, and weapons system development, and would affect homeland and regional commitments, including a likely delay of one year for the European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 3 \u2013 a national commitment to our allies.  Also, the reduction in advanced procurement funding for the Standard Missile-3 IB could increase its planned procurement cost by about $140 million.    Opposition to Unrequested Funding.  The Administration objects to the billions of dollars provided for items DOD did not request and does not need, such as additional EA-18G aircraft, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, M-1 Abrams upgrades, and a significantly larger amount of funding for the National Guard and Reserve Equipment Account than provided in recent years.  The Administration is also concerned that section 8006 of the bill makes spending on these and other unnecessary items statutorily required, diverting scarce resources from more important defense programs and limiting the Secretary's flexibility to manage the Department efficiently.    Classified Programs.  The Administration looks forward to providing its views on the adjustments contained in the Classified Annex to the bill once it becomes available.   4  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  5  ", "The Administration believes H.R. 2217, making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other purposes, funds critical priorities, and looks forward to working on its provisions as part of an acceptable budget framework.  However, enacting H.R. 2217, while adhering to the overall spending limits in the House Budget\u2019s topline discretionary level for fiscal year (FY) 2014, would hurt our economy and require draconian cuts to middle-class priorities.  These cuts could result in hundreds of thousands of low-income children losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of children with disabilities losing Federal funding for their special education teachers and aides, thousands of Federal agents who can\u2019t enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend fugitives, and thousands of scientists without medical grants, which would slow research that could lead to new treatments and cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s, and hurt America\u2019s economic competitiveness.   Prior to consideration of appropriations bills the Congress should complete an appropriate framework for all the appropriations bills.  More than a month has passed since the deadline for action and the Congress has yet to appoint conferees and agree on a budget resolution.  Unless this bill passes the Congress in the context of an overall budget framework that supports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national security for our economy to compete in the future, the President\u2019s senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2217 and any other legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.    Disaster Relief Funding.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's funding level for the Disaster Relief Fund, including $595 million for base program activity and $5.6 billion provided as a disaster relief cap adjustment made pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee does not fully fund the President\u2019s request for 1,600 new Customs and Border  Protection officers and does not include a provision allowing for additional officers through increased customs and immigration inspection user fees.  The addition of these officers to the CBP workforce would promote travel and tourism by reducing wait times for travelers and cargo entering the country, in turn stimulating domestic employment and strengthening the economy.    Cybersecurity.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s continued support for important Federal cybersecurity initiatives, including the EINSTEIN program and continuous monitoring of Federal networks for malicious cyber activity.   Transportation Security Administration.  The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s failure to reform the aviation passenger fee as proposed in the President\u2019s FY 2014 Budget.  National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF).  The Administration objects to incremental funding of the NBAF project.  NBAF is anticipated to be a national asset critical to the protection of the Nation\u2019s food supply.  The partial funding provided in the bill will delay construction of NBAF, increase project costs, and leave a significant vulnerability unaddressed.  Long-standing procurement policy prohibits incremental funding because it undermines program stability and runs counter to sound budgeting principles and fiscal discipline.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  The Administration appreciates the support provided for investigations of human trafficking and intellectual property rights violations.  However, the Administration opposes the Committee's decision to fund 2,200 unrequested detention beds.  The Administration encourages the Congress to focus detention capabilities on priority and mandatory detainees, while continuing to increase support for ICE\u2019s Alternative to Detention program, which has consistently helped to ensure low-risk individuals in removal proceedings appear for hearings and comply with removal orders at a lower per-day cost than detention.  The Administration also objects to the funding provided above the FY 2014 Budget request for the 287(g) program, since Secure Communities is more consistent, efficient, and cost-effective in identifying and removing criminal and other priority aliens than the 287(g) program, and has been deployed nationwide.   U.S. Coast Guard.  The Administration objects to incremental funding for Coast Guard acquisition of National Security Cutter (NSC)-7 and NSC-8 and rescinding FY 2013 appropriations for shore support needs for NSC-6.  Although the Administration supports Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition of NSC-7, long-standing procurement policy prohibits incremental funding because it undermines program stability and runs counter to sound budgeting principles and fiscal discipline.  Departmental Management.  The Administration opposes the lack of funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) headquarters consolidation project, which will delay the development and occupancy of the St. Elizabeths campus.  Civilian Pay Raise.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for Federal civilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.  State and Local Grant Programs.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee continues to provide some flexibility to the Secretary of Homeland Security to award grants, as authorized 2  in FY 2013, and encourages the House to adopt all of the flexibilities requested in the President\u2019s FY 2014 Budget for the National Preparedness Grant Program (NPGP).  Prohibition on Immigration from Brazil.  The Administration objects to a provision in the bill that seeks to prohibit legal immigration from Brazil.  The punitive language prevents the processing of family- and employment-sponsored immigration petitions as well as for any humanitarian applications such as for asylum, refugee status, or Violence Against Women Act-related immigration protection.  Abortion-Related Provisions.  The Administration strongly opposes sections 564, 565, and 566 of the bill that purport to limit the use of Federal funds for providing or facilitating abortion services.  Longstanding Federal policy prohibits Federal funds from being used for these services, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  Current DHS practice does not compel employees to perform or facilitate them, or permit Federal funds to be used to acquire these services except in cases where a pregnancy is the result of rape, incest, or threatens the life of the woman.  Constitutional Concerns      The Administration strongly objects to and has constitutional concerns about the provisions of section 533 that limit the use of funds to transfer detainees and otherwise restrict detainee transfers.  Although the Administration opposes the release of detainees within the United States, section 533 undermines our national security and raises significant separation of powers concerns.  This provision unnecessarily constrains the Nation's counterterrorism efforts, particularly where Federal courts are the best \u2013 or even the only \u2013 option for incapacitating dangerous terrorists.  For decades, presidents of both political parties have leveraged the flexibility and strength of this country\u2019s Federal courts to incapacitate dangerous terrorists and gather critical intelligence.  The continued prosecution of terrorists in Federal court is an essential element of counterterrorism efforts \u2013 a powerful tool that must remain an available option.  Such restrictions or interferences would, in certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.   Additionally, Section 512 purports to prevent funds from being used to exercise supervisory control over preparation of certain reports by the Privacy Officer of the Department of Homeland Security.  This provision implicates separation of powers concerns by imposing a potentially material practical burden on the President's effective supervision and management of the Executive Branch.  The Administration urges that it be deleted.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations process moves forward.   * * * * * * * 3  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 4745, making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes.  The bill fails to make needed investments in our Nation's infrastructure, provides insufficient support for critical housing programs for low-income Americans and the homeless, and includes objectionable language provisions.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations process that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding unnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include reconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and national security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an orderly appropriations process.   The President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our national security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same time, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to deliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.    The President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels.  However, the levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation and are not sufficient \u2013 either in FY 2015 or beyond \u2013 to ensure the Nation is achieving its full potential.  For that reason, the Budget also includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative \u2013 evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities \u2013 that presents additional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would support a number of investments, including additional funding to revitalize neighborhoods of concentrated poverty and assist public housing residents to secure gainful employment, and funding for grants to promote more integrated housing and transportation investments.  Further, through its fully paid for GROW AMERICA Act proposal, the Administration has requested $302 billion over four years for highways, transit, highway safety, and rail programs, as well as for Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grants.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to fund critical investments to rebuild our transportation infrastructure, create jobs, and grow the economy.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve these issues during the FY 2015 appropriations process.  Department of Transportation (DOT)  Surface Transportation Funding.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact the GROW AMERICA Act proposal.  The legislation would provide $302 billion over four years for highways, transit, highway safety, and rail programs, as well as for TIGER grants, and is paid for by pro-growth business tax reforms.  There is bipartisan agreement that more funding is needed to improve infrastructure in order to allow people and goods to move safely and efficiently through the Nation.  The Committee's proposed funding level, which freezes obligation limitations for highway, transit, and highway safety at FY 2014 authorized levels, demonstrates why a robust, multi-year authorization is essential to provide the funding boost that States and municipalities require to make the necessary and transformative transportation investments that their citizens are demanding.    National Infrastructure Investments.  The Administration urges the Congress to increase funding for TIGER grants to a level sufficient to support innovative projects across the Nation. The funding level provided in the bill is a $500 million reduction below the FY 2014 enacted levels and would reduce an already highly competitive grant program and its ability to support innovative projects across the United States.  Further, the Committee's decision to eliminate grant funding eligibility for transit and passenger rail projects would stifle the multimodal innovation TIGER has helped spur since the program's inception.   Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Capital Investment (New Starts) Grants.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested funding level of $2.5 billion for FTA Capital Investment New Starts.  The funding provided in the bill would only fund payments on current projects and not allow FTA to initiate new grant agreements with communities whose projects have demonstrated merit through the pipeline.   High-Performance Passenger Rail.  The Administration strongly opposes the Committee's reduction of $200 million below the FY 2014 funding level for passenger rail programs, which would result in significant delays in much needed capital investments and contribute to deteriorating performance.  As proposed in the GROW AMERICA Act, the Administration believes that the Congress should be investing in high-performance passenger rail service to meet the transportation needs of our growing population.  In addition to providing grant funds to improve passenger rail service at the national and state level and to help commuter railroads install positive train control systems, the Administration's proposal would also restructure Federal support for Amtrak to increase transparency, accountability, and performance.    High Speed Rail.  The Administration strongly objects to prohibiting the Surface Transportation Board from taking any action to approve subsequent phases of the California High Speed Rail project between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  The Administration believes passenger rail can play an important role in addressing transportation needs and opposes any attempts to limit state and local choices to enhance passenger rail.  2  Safe Transport of Energy Products.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee did not provide the requested $40 million proposed in the FY 2015 Budget to support the multimodal prevention and response activities associated with the increased safety issues surrounding the transport of crude oil.  However, the Administration appreciates that the Committee provided the requested funding level of $52 million in the FY 2015 Budget for the Hazardous Materials Safety account.  Though not intended to address the safe transport issue exclusively, it is a step toward funding the additional research, training, and outreach associated with the recent surge in oil and natural gas transportation.   Infrastructure Permitting Center.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee did not provide the requested funding level for the interagency permitting center, which is essential to modernizing and streamlining the Federal permitting and review process, reducing the time it takes to start infrastructure projects while improving outcomes for the environment.  The requested funding supports key reforms in the Administration\u2019s comprehensive plan, announced by the President last month, which that includes 15 reforms and nearly 100 actions to significantly improve Federal permitting to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity, and improve the competitiveness of the American economy. Expanding permitting reform Government-wide to build a 21st century infrastructure is also a critical component of the President\u2019s Management Agenda, aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government.    Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for FAA, including funding to hire and train additional safety inspectors and keep modernization of the air traffic control system on track.  Highway and Motor Carrier Safety.  The Administration objects to the provisions altering the permissible size and weight of trucks operating over Federal highways in the states of Mississippi, Wisconsin and Idaho.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), the Department of Transportation is currently conducting a comprehensive truck size and weight limits study.  Any reconsideration of size and weight limits should be done on a comprehensive basis with full consideration of the infrastructure and safety impacts as informed by the MAP-21 study.  The Administration opposes provisions that serve to weaken highway safety by altering or revising the existing safety regulations for motor carrier operators.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Housing Choice Vouchers.  The Administration is deeply concerned about the funding level provided for the Housing Choice Vouchers program.  The funding level in the bill is insufficient to provide the same level of assistance to families as in 2014 and would not restore the sequestration cut.  The Administration also strongly urges the Congress to fund the Voucher program\u2019s administrative fees at the President's request of $1.7 billion so that Public Housing Authorities can ensure that units are safe and habitable.     Homeless Assistance Grants.  The Administration strongly opposes the level of funding provided for Homeless Assistance Grants.  The bill funds the program at $2.1 billion, which is $301 million below the FY 2015 Budget, and would not allow for the development of any new permanent supportive housing as part of the Administration\u2019s efforts to end chronic homelessness in 2016.  3   Choice Neighborhoods.  The Administration strongly opposes the $25 million funding level provided for Choice Neighborhoods, which is $95 million below the FY 2015 Budget.  At this funding level, Public Housing Authorities and other local entities will be extraordinarily limited in their ability to revitalize distressed HUD-assisted housing and build ladders of opportunity for low-income families in surrounding high-poverty neighborhoods.   Public Housing Programs.  The Administration opposes the $6.2 billion in funding provided for the Public Housing Operating Fund and Capital Fund programs.  This funding level, which is $350 million below the FY 2015 Budget, may delay necessary maintenance and capital improvements and expose low-income families to deteriorating living conditions.  The Administration also urges the Congress to eliminate the 60,000 unit cap on the Rental Assistance Demonstration, as requested in the FY 2015 Budget, to preserve additional Public Housing properties by converting them to long-term Section 8 contracts.   Homeowners Armed With Knowledge Demonstration Project (HAWK).  The Administration opposes section 232 of the bill, which prohibits the use of funds to implement the HAWK, a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) demonstration which combines housing counseling with FHA-insured mortgages to expand access to affordable mortgage credit for creditworthy borrowers.  The Administration also urges the Congress to adopt the proposed new fee for FHA administrative expenses, which would lower taxpayer risks by enabling FHA to perform enhanced oversight of its lending partners.     Housing Counseling.  The Administration opposes the $47 million in funding provided for HUD's Housing Counseling program.  This funding level is $13 million, or 22 percent, below the FY 2015 Budget.  While the housing market has improved, there are still many households facing the aftermath of the financial crisis and counseling is an important resource in helping households find affordable and stable housing.   HOME Investment Partnerships Program.  The Administration opposes the $700 million in funding provided for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which is $250 million below the FY 2015 Budget.  The Administration urges the Congress to support this program at the requested level in order to increase the supply of affordable housing for low-income families.   HUD Information Technology (IT) Fund.  The Administration opposes the $100 million in funding provided for the HUD IT Fund, which is $172 million below the FY 2015 Budget.  The Administration urges the Congress to support the IT Fund at the requested level to ensure HUD has sufficient resources to support its core IT needs; the level provided in the bill will inhibit HUD from carrying out its mission.    Fair Housing.  The Administration opposes the $46 million in funding provided for the Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity program, which reflects a reduction of $25 million or 35 percent below the FY 2015 Budget.  This reduced funding level would severely curtail investigations of fair housing complaints and undermine efforts to support fair housing throughout the United States.   Lead Hazard Control.  The Administration opposes the $70 million in funding provided for Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grants, which is a reduction of $50 million or 42 percent 4  below the FY 2015 Budget.  This reduction will leave thousands of low-income families with children at continued risk of exposure to lead-based paint hazards and other home health hazards.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations process moves forward.   * * * * * * *   5  ", "The Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, and that they are tailored to advance statutory goals in a manner that is efficient and cost-effective, while minimizing uncertainty.  Accordingly, the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2804, the Achieving Less Excess in Regulation and Requiring Transparency (ALERRT) Act of 2014.  The bill would impose unneeded and costly analytical and procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from performing their statutory responsibilities.  It would also create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty, increase costs for businesses and State, local and tribal governments, and impede common-sense protections for the American public. The ALERRT Act would impose unnecessary new procedures on agencies and invite frivolous litigation.  When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, it already must adhere to the requirements of the statute that it is implementing.  In many cases, the Congress has mandated that the agency issue the particular rule or regulation, and it often prescribes the process that the agency must follow.  Agencies also must adhere to the robust and well-understood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), and the Congressional Review Act.  In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been guided by executive orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties.  These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.  Final regulations are subject to review by the Federal courts which, among other things, examine whether agencies have satisfied the substantive and procedural requirements of all applicable statutes, and whether they have considered input from relevant stakeholders. With respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act in particular, agencies already have in place procedures and policies, as required by executive orders and other presidential directives, to ensure that they take into account the consequences of rulemaking on small businesses.  This Administration's commitment to promoting small businesses and ensuring that regulations do not unduly burden them also is reflected in Executive Order 13563, which requires agencies to examine existing regulations and to eliminate, streamline, or alter them where they are excessively burdensome. Passage of H.R. 2804 would replace this time-honored framework with layers of additional, unnecessary procedural requirements that would seriously undermine the ability of agencies to execute their statutory mandates.  It would require cumbersome \u201cformal\u201d rulemaking for a new category of rules, for which agencies would have to conduct quasi-adjudicatory proceedings.  In addition, the bill would impose unnecessary new evidentiary standards as a condition of  rulemaking.  Finally, the bill would subject the regulatory process to unneeded rounds of litigation, introduce redundant processes for litigation settlements, and require numerous, cumbersome layers of reporting. If H.R. 2804 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * *   2  ", "The Administration believes H.R. 2216, making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other purposes, funds critical priorities, and looks forward to working on its provisions as part of an acceptable budget framework.  However, enacting H.R. 2216, while adhering to the overall spending limits in the House Budget\u2019s topline discretionary level for fiscal year (FY) 2014, would hurt our economy and require draconian cuts to middle-class priorities.

The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.    Military Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for critical military construction projects but objects to the use of incremental funding for the Public Health Command Lab Replacement project at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.  Incremental funding of military construction projects runs counter to sound budgeting principles and fiscal discipline.   Arlington National Cemetery (ANC).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's continued support for ANC programs, which will help the Cemetery achieve and maintain the highest standards of service and accountability.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the ANC Advisory Commission\u2019s efforts to meet future burial needs.  Civilian Pay Raise.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for Federal civilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.  Detainee Matters.  The Administration strongly opposes section 413, which would prohibit the use of funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  This prohibition would constrain the flexibility that the Nation's Armed Forces and counterterrorism professionals need to deal with evolving threats, intruding upon the Executive Branch's ability to carry out its mission.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration supports S. 1392, the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2013.  This bipartisan legislation would codify and enhance existing Federal programs, further supporting successful efforts to reduce energy waste through building energy codes and industrial energy efficiency programs and by identifying efficiency opportunities in Federal buildings.  S. 1392 complements key energy efficiency dimensions of the President\u2019s Climate Action Plan that will work to cut carbon pollution and begin to slow the effects of climate change, so that we can leave a cleaner and more stable environment for future generations.  Energy efficiency is a large, low\u2010cost, and underutilized U.S. energy resource.  Increased energy efficiency offers savings on energy bills, opportunities for more jobs, and improved industrial competitiveness, and it will lower air pollution.  The Administration strongly supports improving energy efficiency in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors and in the Federal government.    S. 1392 would build on the momentum established by the Administration\u2019s \u201call of the above\u201d energy strategy, supporting the President\u2019s goal to cut in half the energy wasted by U.S. homes and businesses by 2030.  From supporting States and local governments with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act investments (which has led to over one million homes being weatherized and to other local energy efficiency improvements), to partnering with companies and businesses to reduce their energy bills through the Better Buildings Initiative, to Federal administrative actions to cut energy use across Federal facilities, the Administration is committed to winning the future by catalyzing a homegrown, clean energy economy in the United States.    S. 1392 will support the Administration\u2019s efforts to strengthen U.S. competitiveness through significant research and development investments in manufacturing innovation and productivity, such as the Department of Energy\u2019s recently launched Clean Energy Manufacturing Initiative.  This initiative focuses on growing U.S. manufacturing of clean energy products, boosting U.S. manufacturing competitiveness across the board by increasing manufacturing energy productivity, and providing training and technical assistance for manufacturers.    The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress on this bipartisan legislation to support energy efficiency and boost U.S. competitiveness and job creation.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2642, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013.  Because the 608 page bill was made available only this evening, the Administration has had inadequate time to fully review the text of the bill. It is apparent, though, that the bill does not contain sufficient commodity and crop insurance reforms and does not invest in renewable energy, an important source of jobs and economic growth in rural communities across the country.  Legislation as important as a Farm Bill should be constructed in a comprehensive approach that helps strengthen all aspects of the Nation.  This bill also fails to reauthorize nutrition programs, which benefit millions of Americans -- in rural, suburban and urban areas alike.  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is a cornerstone of our Nation\u2019s food assistance safety net, and should not be left behind as the rest of the Farm Bill advances. If the President were presented with H.R. 2642, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 5016, making appropriations for financial services and general government for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015.  The bill impedes implementation of the Affordable Care Act, undermines critical components of Wall Street reform, and fails to provide the resources necessary to provide robust taxpayer services and improve tax enforcement.  Further, the legislation includes ideological and political provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation.  If the President were presented with H.R. 5016, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on an orderly appropriations process that supports economic growth, opportunity, and our national security while avoiding unnecessary fiscal crises that hold the Nation's economy back.  This process should include reconciling funding levels for individual appropriations bills to promote economic growth and national security, and passing bills without ideological provisions that could undermine an orderly appropriations process.   The President's fiscal year (FY) 2015 Budget provides a roadmap for making investments to accelerate economic growth, expand opportunity for all hard-working Americans, and ensure our national security, while continuing to improve the Nation's long-term fiscal outlook.  At the same time, the Budget takes key steps to both continue and enhance the Administration's efforts to deliver a Government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.    The President's Budget adheres to the FY 2015 spending levels agreed to in the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) and shows the choices the President would make at those levels.  However, the levels agreed to in the BBA are already below FY 2007 funding levels adjusted for inflation and are not sufficient\u2014either in FY 2015 or beyond\u2014to ensure the Nation is achieving its full potential.  For that reason, the Budget also includes a fully paid for Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative\u2014evenly split between defense and non-defense priorities\u2014that presents additional investments to grow the economy, expand opportunity, and enhance security.  The Opportunity, Growth, and Security Initiative would support a number of investments, including additional resources to improve customer service at the Internal Revenue Service and to provide more useful public reporting of Federal spending data.    The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill and urges the Congress to resolve these issues during the FY 2015 appropriations process.   Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The Administration strongly opposes the $1.5 billion reduction in funding for the IRS compared to the FY 2015 Budget request.  Reverting the agency's funding level to FY 2008 levels would hinder IRS efforts to provide robust service to taxpayers, improve enforcement operations, and implement new statutory responsibilities.  Further, these reductions would impact efforts aimed at deficit reduction, as funding for IRS enforcement activities returns many times its cost in the form of increased revenue collections.  Additionally, the Administration strongly opposes sections of the bill that limit IRS funding and transfers to carry out implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), through which millions of individuals have signed up for coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplaces.  The Administration also objects to provisions that unnecessarily encumber IRS operations with reporting requirements and unduly restrict the IRS's ability to finalize regulations.   Community Development Financial Institutions Fund Program (CDFI).  The Administration appreciates the support for CDFI, which is funded at $230 million, $5.1 million above the FY 2015 Budget request.  However, the Administration is disappointed that within the total, the bill does not provide the $35 million requested for the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, which is designed to increase the availability of affordable, healthy food outlets in underserved urban and rural communities.  The Administration is also disappointed that the bill does not provide for the requested continuation of the CDFI Bond Guarantee program beyond FY 2014; the program requires no additional funding and serves as a source of much needed long-term capital in underserved and economically disadvantaged communities.     Departmental Offices and Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.  The Administration objects to the $28 million reduction in funding from the FY 2015 Budget request for Departmental Offices Salaries and Expenses.  This level would unreasonably impinge on the ability of the Department to carry out its core mission of providing leadership in economic and fiscal policy.  It would also fail to sufficiently fund the Department's administration and implementation of the new Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, which could significantly delay grant awards to the five affected States.  The Administration also objects to the creation of a new independent account for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, which contributes to the reduction in resources available for other management functions.   Office of Financial Research (OFR).  The Administration opposes language in the bill that would subject OFR to the annual appropriations process beginning in FY 2016 and could limit the agency's ability to develop critical market analysis if funding shortfalls prevent information technology investments or hiring of highly-skilled staff.    Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) Restrictions.  The Administration opposes language in the bill that prohibits the use of funds for the enforcement of any rule, regulation, policy, or guideline related to the Department of the Treasury's Guidance for U.S. Positions on MDBs Engaging with Developing Countries on Coal-Fired Power Generation.  This language is counter to Administration efforts to limit support for coal-fired power plants and to reduce carbon emissions.       2  Executive Office of the President (EOP)  EOP Funding.  The Administration strongly opposes the reduction in funding for Salaries and Expenses among the components within the EOP, which is $3 million below the FY 2014 enacted level, and $7 million below the FY 2015 Budget request.  The Administration strongly objects to the proposed reduction for the President's Council of Economic Advisers, which would limit CEA's ability to monitor the state of the economy and develop policies that will promote economic growth.  The Administration also strongly objects to the absence of any funding for Unanticipated Needs.  Without any funding, the President's flexibility to meet unanticipated needs for the furtherance of the national interest, security, or defense is severely hampered.  Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  The Administration strongly opposes the funding level in the bill for OMB, which is $4 million below the FY 2015 Budget request, as well as the unnecessary withholding of $52 million of OMB resources until the FY 2016 Budget request is submitted to the Congress.  The Administration objects to bill language that would require burdensome OMB cost estimates to accompany the issuance of all Executive orders, as well as language that would require OMB to submit to the Congress a burdensome and duplicative report of limited value estimating the costs of implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.     Prohibition on Paying Salaries and Expenses.  The Administration objects to section 621 of the bill would impinge on the President's ability to organize EOP operations by continuing a prohibition on paying salaries and expenses for certain White House staff positions.    General Services Administration (GSA)  Federal Buildings Fund.  The Administration strongly opposes the lack of funding for the Federal Buildings Fund, which is $787 million less than the FY 2015 Budget request.  At the level provided, the bill fails to sufficiently fund the GSA capital program, eliminating priority new construction and repair and alteration projects.  The bill's funding level also fails to sufficiently fund the operating activities and could force the Government to default on its rent obligation to private sector lessors.     Electronic Government (E-Gov) Fund Consolidation.  The Administration appreciates the combined level of funding and authorities for GSA's E-Gov Fund and Federal Citizen Services Fund (FCSF).  Increased availability of access to the Internet has created opportunities to merge the functions of the FCSF and the E-Gov Fund while improving the ability of the Federal Government to interact with citizens and businesses through improved Digital Services offerings.   Allowances and Office Staff for Former Presidents.  The Former Presidents Act of 1958 requires GSA to provide former Presidents with allowances and office staff, in addition to their pension and benefits, to carry out the duties associated with their former office.  The bill would fund this activity at $1.7 million, half the requested level of $3.4 million, thereby limiting GSA's ability to fully support the former Presidents in the manner required by law.    Small Business Administration (SBA)  Entrepreneurial Development Programs.  While appreciative of the total funding provided for the Entrepreneurial Development Programs in the bill, the Administration opposes the 3  elimination of funding for Regional Innovation Cluster grants and Growth Accelerators, as well as the reduction of funding for Entrepreneurial Education below the level requested in the FY 2015 Budget.  These reductions would impede SBA's ongoing efforts to help regions leverage their unique assets to create jobs by turning entrepreneurial ideas into sustainable high-growth small businesses.    Business Loans Program.  The Administration appreciates the funding in the bill for SBA's business loan programs at a level that would support over $29 billion in lending to small businesses in FY 2015.  The Administration strongly encourages the Congress to also include the requested reauthorization of the 504 Loan Refinancing Program, which would allow thousands of businesses to refinance their debt into lower interest rate loans to open up cash flow for investments and other expenses at no cost to taxpayers.    Disaster Loans Program.  The Administration urges the Congress to utilize the disaster relief cap adjustment authorized in the Budget Control Act of 2011 to fund the $155 million request for SBA's administrative costs associated with major disasters.  By not utilizing the cap adjustment, the bill makes unnecessary reductions to other programs to accommodate this line of support to small businesses after disaster.    Other Independent Agencies  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Administration strongly objects to the funding level of $1.4 billion for the SEC, which is $300 million below the FY 2015 Budget request.  The bill also prohibits authorized spending from the agency's mandatory Reserve Fund, which would reduce the resources available to the SEC in FY 2015 by an additional $50 million.  At this funding level, the SEC would be unable to add critical positions in market oversight, compliance, and enforcement to carry out its financial oversight responsibilities under the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other authorities.  The SEC is fee-funded and its funding level has no impact on the deficit.    Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that would subject CFPB funding to the appropriations process beginning in FY 2016.  Doing so would weaken the agency's essential independence and undermine its ability to consistently serve the most vulnerable consumer populations.  The bill would also impose burdensome and unnecessary reporting requirements regarding the CFPB's funding and operations.  The CFPB already routinely testifies before the Congress on its budget and performance, regularly posts financial reports on its website, and is arguably subject to greater oversight than any other Federal financial regulator.  The additional reporting requirements this bill would impose on the agency are costly, duplicative, and provide no material benefit.    Election Assistance Commission (EAC).  The Administration opposes the elimination of funding for EAC, which assists State and local entities with election administration and certifies voting equipment.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund EAC at the $10 million level included in the FY 2015 Budget request; $8.1 million for EAC and $1.9 million for related activities performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.    Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The Administration strongly objects to the reduction in funding in the bill for the FCC, which is funded $53 million below the FY 2015 4  Budget request and $17 million below the FY 2014 enacted level.  This funding level would undermine efforts at the FCC to modernize information technology systems, better map and analyze spectrum usage to free up more bandwidth for commercial use, and continue needed reforms to the Universal Service Fund.    United States Postal Service.  The Administration is disappointed that language under the Payment to the Postal Service Fund account would prohibit the Postal Service from modifying its delivery schedule to better adapt to its current business environment.    Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB).  The Administration appreciates the increase to the PCLOB funding level over the FY 2014 enacted level, but is disappointed that the bill only provides $4.5 million, which is more than 40 percent below the FY 2015 Budget request.  At the funding level provided, PCLOB would be unable to hire the staff needed to perform effective and independent oversight of counterterrorism-related programs.    Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS).  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for ACUS, which would help save taxpayer dollars through ACUS recommendations.    District of Columbia (D.C.)    Local Budget and Local Legislative Autonomy.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the provisions requested in the FY 2015 Budget that allow D.C. to spend its own local taxes and other non-Federal funds without congressional approval, and that enable local legislation to take effect immediately upon adoption by the District government.    Restrictions on the District's Use of Local Funds.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that restricts D.C. from using its local funds for abortion services, undermining the principle of States' rights and of District home rule.  Longstanding Federal policy already prohibits Federal funds from being used for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered.  Similarly, the Administration strongly opposes the language in the bill preventing the District from using its own local funds to carry out locally-passed marijuana policies, which again undermines the principles of States' rights and of District home rule.  Furthermore, the language poses legal challenges to the Metropolitan Police Department's enforcement of all marijuana laws currently in force in the District.    Needle Exchange.  The Administration strongly opposes the restriction in the bill on the use of Federal funds for the District's needle exchange programs.  This is contrary to current law and the Administration's policy to allow the use of funds in locations where local authorities deem needle exchange programs to be effective and appropriate.    Education.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill compromises a statutorily-mandated evaluation of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) by requiring that funds be made available to students in the control group of a multi-year, multi-million dollar Department of Education study already underway.  This study is critical to evaluating the impact of OSP vouchers on the academic achievement of participating students.  The Administration also objects to the bill's reduction of funding for D.C. Tuition Assistance Grants, which would 5  severely limit assistance available to D.C. students attending public colleges across the United States.    Other Provisions  Cuba Restriction.  The Administration strongly opposes language in the bill that would prohibit funding for non-academic educational exchanges to Cuba.  This language would result in a reduction of people-to-people interactions and as such is counter to the Administration's policy to increase overall travel and the flow of information and resources to private Cubans.  This provision is an unwarranted restriction on purposeful travel to Cuba.    Abortion in Multi-State Qualified Health Plans.  The Administration objects to language in the bill that would prohibit funding for abortion or administrative expenses in connection with a multi-State qualified health plan.  The ACA already includes segregated funding requirements that are structured to ensure no Federal funds are used for abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or life of the woman.  The language is unnecessary and goes beyond longstanding policy.  Impediments to Derivatives Market Reforms.  The Administration opposes language in the bill that would amend the Wall Street Reform Act to prohibit regulators from implementing key reforms to the derivatives markets designed to prevent excessive risk taking by financial institutions that are backed by Federal programs.  It undermines the efforts under the law to strengthen the Nation's financial system by reducing risks for market participants. Public-Private Competition.  The Administration opposes elimination of the mora torium on public-private competition between Government employees and private sector contractors to perform commercial activities that support agency missions.  OMB continues to work with agencies on efforts to ensure the most effective mix of Federal employees and contractors and believes more time is needed for its guidance addressing management of the multisector workforce to take effect before the moratorium is lifted.  The Administration urges the Congress to continue the moratorium in FY 2015, as proposed in the FY 2015 Budget.  Constitutional Concerns    There are multiple provisions of the bill that raise constitutional concerns.  Section 203 of the bill would prohibit the use of funds for officers or employees of the EOP \"to prepare, sign, or approve statements abrogating legislation passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate and signed by the President,\" and section 204 would prohibit the use of funds for such officers and employees \"to prepare or implement an Executive Order that contravenes existing law.\"  Contrary to the implication of section 203, presidential signing statements do not abrogate legislation.  They indicate how the Executive Branch would apply acts of the Congress to ensure faithful execution of the laws.  Similarly contrary to the implication of section 204, executive orders are designed to implement the law, not to contravene it.  To the extent sections 203 and 204 purport to prevent the President from making use of his immediate aides in the EOP to prepare any statement articulating the conclusion that a particular provision of law is unconstitutional and therefore would not be executed, in whole or in part, or from making use of these aides to prepare or implement an executive order instructing others in the Executive Branch as to how to carry out this determination, these provisions would 6  impermissibly encroach upon the President's constitutional authority to execute and interpret Federal laws, including the Constitution.    Section 621 of the bill would prohibit the use of funds for several positions that involve providing advice directly to the President and any \"substantially similar positions.\"  The President has well-established authority to supervise and oversee the Executive Branch, and to obtain advice in furtherance of this supervisory authority.  The President also has the prerogative to obtain advice that would assist him in carrying out his constitutional responsibilities, and to do so not only from Executive Branch officials and employees outside the White House, but also from advisors within it.  Legislative efforts that significantly impede the President's ability to exercise his supervisory and coordinating authorities or to obtain the views of the appropriate senior advisors violate the separation of powers.  Finally, section 713 of the bill is phrased in a manner that could be construed to require the Executive Branch to disclose, without discretion, certain classified and other privileged information, in which case it would intrude on the President's discharge of his constitutional authorities.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2015 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  7  ", "The Administration supports passage of H.R. 4984, Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act, which strengthens financial counseling requirements for students receiving federal student aid.  This legislation would help students get the information they need to make responsible decisions about how to pay for higher education.  While the bill offers a modest step in the right direction, it does not provide any new resources for these purposes.  This legislation is not a substitute for much needed and more comprehensive action to tackle the rising cost of a college education.  The Administration urges the Congress to do more to ensure that college is affordable for American families.  This is particularly important today, when a college education is critical to ensuring that our workforce has the skills needed to meet the demands of the Nation's growing economy.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to improve this legislation.  * * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2410, making appropriations for  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014.  The bill severely undermines key investments in financial oversight in a manner that would cripple Wall Street reform, and impedes implementation of statutorily-mandated financial regulations.  It also imposes harmful cuts in rural economic development, renewable energy development, nutrition programs, food safety, agricultural research, and international food aid.  Investing in these areas is critical to the Nation's economic growth, security, and global competitiveness.  If the President were presented with H.R. 2410, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  In addition, enacting H.R. 2410, while adhering to the overall spending limits in the House Budget's topline discretionary level for fiscal year (FY) 2014, would hurt our economy and require draconian cuts to middle-class priorities.  These cuts could result in hundreds of thousands of low-income children losing access to Head Start programs, tens of thousands of children with disabilities losing Federal funding for their special education teachers and aides, thousands of Federal agents who can't enforce drug laws, combat violent crime or apprehend fugitives, and thousands of scientists without medical grants, which would slow research that could lead to new treatments and cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, and hurt America's economic competitiveness.   More than two months have passed since the deadline for action and the Congress has yet to appoint conferees and agree on a budget resolution.  Prior to consideration of appropriations bills the Congress should complete an appropriate framework for all the appropriations bills that supports our recovery and enables sufficient investments in education, infrastructure, innovation and national security for our economy to compete in the future.  As such, the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto H.R. 2410 and any other legislation that implements the House Republican Budget framework.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee's version of the bill.    U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  International Food Aid Reform.  The Administration strongly objects to the funding level provided in the Committee bill for P.L. 480 Title II.  The bill fails to incorporate any of the efficiencies sought in the President's food aid reform request, and instead cuts P.L. 480 Title II funding by over 20 percent compared to the Budget request, with the reduction coming entirely out of emergency food aid.  By cutting emergency food aid funding and excluding the proposed changes to allow  more efficient food aid, the bill would delay food aid to starving people up to 14 weeks and would preclude as many as 12 million people from receiving life-saving assistance than under the Administration's proposal.  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).  The Administration is deeply concerned that the WIC funding level in the Committee bill puts the program at significant risk of being unable to serve all eligible women and children who seek assistance, which could result in waiting lists, greater hardship, and poorer health outcomes for this vulnerable population.  In addition, the low funding level would effectively end the breastfeeding peer counseling program for the year, stall needed technology investments to improve program efficiency, and deplete the contingency reserve just to cover anticipated costs, leaving the program at risk of further cuts in the event of unexpected changes in food prices or participation.   Child Nutrition School Equipment Grants.  The Administration urges the Congress to fund school meals equipment competitive grants, which would help school districts purchase the equipment needed to serve healthier meals, improve food safety, expand access to meals, and improve energy efficiency.   Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  The Administration opposes the funding level for FSIS.  In addition to a nearly $10 million reduction from the President's Budget request, the Committee bill forces FSIS to absorb $9 million in rental costs by not providing the necessary funding.  These cuts will significantly impact USDA's ability to adequately inspect food processing plants and prevent foodborne diseases from contaminating America's meat, poultry, and egg product supply.  Over 80 percent of FSIS's employees are frontline inspectors and the Committee's recommendation may require the agency to furlough.  Decreased FSIS inspections will disrupt industry production.    Research Facilities.  The Administration urges the House to include the requested $155 million to fully fund a high priority poultry biosafety and laboratory facility.  State-of-the-art research facilities to replace USDA's aging laboratory infrastructure are key to the Department's ability to meet research challenges of the 21st Century.    Research Grants.  The Administration objects to the level of funding provided for the Agricultural Food and Research Initiative (AFRI) at $291 million, which is a reduction of approximately 24 percent from the FY 2014 Budget request.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the request for competitive peer-reviewed research grants through AFRI.    USDA Funding for GSA Rent.  The Administration urges the Congress to include $164 million in funding for rent as requested in the FY 2014 Budget.  The Committee bill would require 20 agencies\u2014including the three field agencies, the research agencies, the Office of Inspector General and others\u2014to absorb a total of $164 million in fixed rent costs.  This is a de facto reduction to already constrained agency operating budgets.  For example, the bill would require the Economic Research Service to divert more than 8 percent of its current budget to fund rental payments.  These problems are exacerbated by not having the authority requested in the Budget to allow the Department to use mandatory funds to pay for administrative expenses related to delivering certain Commodity Credit Corporation programs.  Evidence-Based Rural Business Grant Proposal.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to include the FY 2014 Budget request to consolidate seven existing rural development grant programs into a new program that would leverage evidence to award rural business grants.   2   Clean and Renewable Energy.  The Administration urges the Congress to include the President's FY 2014 Budget request to move the Rural Electric Loan Program away from fossil fuels and encourage the construction, acquisition, or improvement of renewable energy plants in rural America.  In addition, the Administration urges the House to fund the Rural Energy for America Program at the level requested in the Budget.     Rental Assistance Program.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided full funding for expiring rental assistance contracts expected in FY 2014 of $1.012 billion, which will continue the support for USDA-financed properties on behalf of the tenants who receive subsidized rent.    Ban on Horse Slaughter.  The Administration appreciates reinstatement of the Federal ban on horse slaughter and looks forward to working with the Congress to complete work on this important legislation.   Department of Health and Human Services  Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Administration strongly supports robust funding for FDA to continue implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act and to modernize regulatory science to support medical product innovation.  The Administration is concerned that the Committee bill provides $4.3 billion in total resources for FDA, which is $342 million below the President's request, and does not include new proposed user fees.  The Administration urges the Congress to enact new user fees proposed in the FY 2014 Budget, which would provide significant additional resources to enhance FDA regulatory capacity, as well as provide benefits to industry, advance the Nation's food safety system, and continue implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act.  While the Administration appreciates the funding to continue the development of the FDA Life Sciences/Biodefense laboratory in White Oak, Maryland, the overall reductions in budget authority will limit FDA's ability to oversee the safety and quality of Nation's food and medical products and threaten the agency's ability to improve and maintain FDA's other critical facilities.    Other Agencies  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The Administration strongly opposes the funding level of $195 million for CFTC, which is $120 million below the President's FY 2014 Budget request.  The reduced funding level will seriously impede CFTC's implementation of critical Wall Street reforms to increase market transparency and integrity, reduce risks to the economy and protect consumers, and will unacceptably increase the risk of fraud and manipulation in the $30 trillion futures and $250 trillion swaps markets.    GIPSA Marketing Rule  The Administration strongly opposes a provision in the Committee bill that effectively prevents USDA's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration(GIPSA) from further implementing the remaining portions of a rule on conduct violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.  This provision would rescind many components of the rule that was finalized in December 2011 preventing its full implementation, which is needed to clarify conditions for industry compliance with the Packers and Stockyards Act and provide for a fairer marketplace. 3   Civilian Pay Raise  The Administration urges the Congress to support the proposed 1.0 percent pay increase for Federal civilian employees.  As the President stated in his FY 2014 Budget, a permanent pay freeze is neither sustainable nor desirable.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2014 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  4  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2009 because it would cost millions of hard working middle class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve and will drive up premiums for an estimated 20 million people by more than $4,000 a year on average.  Rather than attempting once again to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which the House has tried nearly 40 times, it is time for the Congress to stop fighting old political battles and join the President in an agenda focused on providing greater economic opportunity and security for middle class families and all those working to get into the middle class.  The Affordable Care Act gives people greater control over their own health care and has already improved many aspects of the Nation\u2019s health care system.  Because of the Affordable Care Act, tens of millions of Americans who have previously lacked health insurance will now be covered.  The nearly one in two Americans under the age of 65 with pre-existing medical conditions will finally be able to purchase a health insurance plan that fits their budget, gives them the care they need, and provides them with the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they cannot be dropped from their health plan or denied coverage.  H.R. 2009 will prohibit implementation of the tax credits that are key to this affordable coverage, undermining health security for millions of Americans.  At a time when the Congress should be increasing small business tax credits to help make health insurance more affordable, this legislation would take them away.    H.R. 2009 would raise health insurance premiums and increase the number of uninsured Americans and represents another attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, with no plan to replace it or policy to improve it.    If the President were presented with H.R. 2009, he would veto it.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.J. Res. 90, which is another attempt at funding the Federal Government in piecemeal fashion by restoring only very limited activities. Consideration of appropriations legislation in this manner is not a serious or responsible way to run the United States Government.  Instead of opening up a few Government functions, the House of Representatives should re-open all of the Government.  The harmful impacts of a shutdown extend across Government, affecting services that are critical to small businesses, women, children, seniors, and others across the Nation.  The Senate acted in a responsible manner on a short-term funding measure to maintain Government functions and avoid a damaging Government shutdown.  The House of Representatives should allow a straight up or down vote on Senate-passed H.J. Res. 59.  If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 90, he would veto the bill.  * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration supports investing in the Nation's water resources to build the foundation for long-term economic growth, address significant risks to public safety, and to protect and restore our environment.  The Administration's key policies and principles will help responsibly meet our Nation's water resources challenges in a fiscally responsible way.  The Administration believes we must move toward legislation that embodies these policies and principles, and S. 601 does not currently support all of those key policies and principles.    Currently, the Corps has a $60 billion construction backlog and increasing operation and maintenance costs of existing infrastructure.  New project authorizations should be limited to projects most likely to provide high economic and environmental returns to the Nation, or address a significant risk to public safety, within the Corps' three main missions: flood and storm damage reduction; commercial navigation; and aquatic ecosystem restoration.  S. 601 would weaken Congressional involvement and transparency in the authorization of Corps studies and construction projects while expanding Federal obligations without ensuring taxpayer dollars are targeted to achieve the highest overall return for the Nation.  Further, it limits spending controls even when actual project costs far exceed authorized levels.   Creating and maintaining our Nation's water resources infrastructure is a shared responsibility between Federal and non-Federal beneficiaries and requires that the management, use, protection, and restoration of our water resources continue to evolve to meet the Nation\u2019s future needs.  S. 601 undermines this principle.  For example, the bill would effectively require a tripling of the amount that the Federal government spends for harbor maintenance and related work \u2013 a $15 billion increase in spending over the next 10 years without regard to the return to the Nation from this investment.  Additionally, the bill would undermine a key reform enacted by the Congress in the landmark Water Resources Development Act of 1986 by eliminating cost-sharing for maintaining channels deeper than 45 feet, and by expanding the Federal role in other areas, which have always been non-Federal responsibilities.  While the Administration welcomes efforts to explore innovative water infrastructure financing tools, and has included a proposal for doing so in its FY 2014 Budget, the Administration has concerns about the proposal in Title X of the bill and would like to continue working with the Congress on specific ways to achieve the goal.   The Administration is deeply concerned that the project permitting provisions in S. 601 are counterproductive, may actually slow project approval, and do not adequately protect communities, taxpayers, or the environment.  The bill constrains science-based decision making, increases litigation risk, and undermines the integrity of several foundational environmental laws, including the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  The Administration is making significant progress to  improve the efficiency of Federal permitting and reviews in a manner that encourages early collaboration, stakeholder engagement and better environmental outcomes while not jeopardizing bedrock environmental laws.  The Administration is aware that discussions on these provisions are ongoing and urges the Senate to reaffirm the current foundational environmental review framework for all water resources projects that fosters transparency, informed decision-making, and strong environmental outcomes, and to encourage the Corps to continue efforts to evaluate the full range of reasonable alternatives and to promote better environmental stewardship.   The Administration supports rebuilding more resiliently after major disasters in light of future risks of substantial storm and flood damage.  Federal policies and investments should encourage and incentivize improved management of water and related land resources at the local level to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance the resiliency and natural functions of floodplains and coastal areas and the communities in them, advance public safety, and promote efforts to preserve and restore aquatic ecosystems.    The Administration also urges a needed reform of the laws governing the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, which an FY 2014 Budget proposal would accomplish.  The proposal would establish an annual per vessel fee to raise $1.1 billion in additional revenue over 10 years from the commercial users of the inland waterways.  This user fee is needed to help finance their 50 percent share of inland waterways capital investments under current law.  It would support economic growth, and reflect actual costs incurred by the Corps on their behalf.  The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress on bipartisan legislation to address the Nation's water resource challenges.    * * * * * * *  2  "], "45-Trump": ["The Administration  recognizes the importance of the National Defense  Authorization Act (NDAA) to our national  security. Unfortunately, this conference report  fails to  include critical national security measures,  includes  provisions that fail  to respect our  veterans and our military\u2019s  history, and contradicts  efforts  by this Administration  to put America first in our national security and foreign policy actions. Therefore, the Administration strongly opposes  passage of  the conference report to Accompany H.R. 6395.  Despite bipartisan calls for addressing Section  230  of the Communications Decency  Act, this  bill fails to make any meaningful changes to that provision. Section 230 facilitates the spread of  disinformation online and is a serious threat to our national security and  election integrity. It  should be repealed.  The conference report also fails to  include  language codifying the Women\u2019s  Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP)  Initiative. To date, this  historic initiative has generated  life-changing effects for women around the world, and the Administration strongly supports its codification into the official mission  of the Department of State to  ensure its  critical work continues in the future.  The  conference report includes language sponsored by Senator  Elizabeth Warren  that would  require the  renaming of  certain military installations. Over  the course of  United States  history, these locations have taken on significance to the  American story and those who have helped write it that  far transcends their namesakes. The Administration respects the legacy of the millions of American  servicemen and women  who have served with honor at these military  bases, and who, from these locations, have fought, bled, and died for their country. President Trump has been clear in his opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to  rewrite history and to displace the enduring legacy of the American Revolution in service  of  a new left-wing cultural revolution.  The conference report also restricts the President\u2019s ability to  preserve our Nation\u2019s security by  arbitrarily limiting the amount of  military construction funds that can be  used to respond to a  national emergency.  In  a time when adversaries have the means to directly attack the homeland, the President must be able to safeguard the American people  without having to wait for  congressional authorization. Numerous provisions of this conference report directly contradict the Administration\u2019s foreign policy, particularly the President\u2019s  efforts to bring our troops  home. The  President  \u2013 and the   American people \u2013  oppose endless wars.  Over bipartisan objections,  however, this  bill purports  to restrict the President\u2019s ability  to  withdraw troops from Afghanistan, Germany, and South Korea. The conference report also undermines critical, bipartisan reforms to the United States  Agency for Global Media and hamstrings the  agency\u2019s newly confirmed CEO. Additionally, the  legislation  eliminates the Department of Defense Chief  Management Officer,  who is  responsible for increasing efficiency  and reducing waste at  the Department of Defense. And it  increases bureaucracy and confuses cybersecurity policymaking by mandating the appointment of a  National Cyber Director  within the Executive Office of the President, ignoring the mechanisms  by which the Government already performs the functions assigned to this new policy position. The Administration strongly opposes these  and other provisions that put  the interests  of the  Washington, D.C. establishment over those of the  American  people.   The Administration stands ready to work with Congress on an improved NDAA, or to separately  enact  critically  important provisions  of this  bill,  such as a pay raise for our troops and the  renewal of expiring  authorities,  through  the appropriations process.

The transfer of Paveway precision-guided capability to the UAE directly supports the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important force for political and economic stability in the Middle East.

As a key partner in the region, the UAE serves as a bulwark against the malign activities of Iran and its proxies and is an active partner in combatting terrorism in Yemen and elsewhere in the region.  Passage of the joint resolution would signal that the United States is willing to abandon its partners and allies at a time when regional threats are increasing daily. The United States has undertaken many actions to help the Coalition mitigate the risk of civilian casualties in Yemen, including training and advising to improve its targeting processes. Combined with this assistance, the provision of precision-guided munitions would further help the Coalition mitigate the risk of civilian casualties.

This legislation would unfairly  force all Federal taxpayers to  subsidize  a tax break for  the wealthy,  as well as  excessive government spending by fiscally irresponsible States.  H.R. 5377 would  likely cause State and local governments to raise taxes, all  while hindering the growth of small businesses and opportunities for workers.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  of 2017 (TCJA), which passed Congress without a single Democrat  vote, is  a signature  achievement of the Trump Administration.  This bill, which President Donald J. Trump signed into law on December 22, 2017, has spurred economic growth across  the Nation by lowering individual tax rates, nearly doubling the standard deduction, simplifying the tax code, and closing special interest loopholes.  Workers and middle-class Americans are  reaping the benefits  of the TCJA in the form  of record low unemployment and substantially higher wages.  H.R. 5377 would turn back the clock by adding a special  interest  provision back into the Federal tax code that unfairly  requires middle-class Americans to  subsidize fiscally irresponsible States and  wealthy taxpayers.  In doing so, H.R. 5377 would violate the principle  that States should raise  their own revenue rather than rely on tax subsidies from the Federal Government. The bill would also reduce  incentives for  States to be fiscally  responsible. Additionally, the provision in H.R. 5377 that would raise  the top income tax rate from 37  percent  to 39.6 percent would stifle economic growth by placing an undue burden on thousands of small  businesses.   Because it is unfair to middle-class taxpayers, encourages excessive spending by  States,  and would stunt  economic growth, H.R. 5377 is poor tax policy that should not be  enacted into law.

Nevertheless, as Congress follows the President\u2019s lead on reducing prescription drug costs, the Administration welcomes bipartisan efforts to enact legislation that provides additional prescription drug-cost relief for American families.    In its current form, H.R. 3 would likely undermine access to lifesaving medicines.  The bill creates a statutory scheme for \u201cnegotiation\u201d between the Secretary of Health and Human Services and pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding the price of prescription drugs, but the penalty for failing to reach agreement with the Secretary is so large that the Secretary could effectively impose price controls on manufacturers.  Moreover, this price-fixing mechanism places price controls on drugs available under Medicare and commercial plans, and imposes devastating fines on manufacturers, raising serious concerns under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause and Eighth Amendment\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause. This bill would also compromise the health of Americans by dramatically reducing the incentive to bring innovative therapeutics to market.  The preliminary Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analysis indicates that the bill would reduce the number of new medicines coming to market.  The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that H.R. 3\u2019s price controls would affect as much as one third of drugs under development, meaning that out of 300 projected new medicines that would otherwise be approved over 10 years by the Food and Drug Administration, 100 could be severely delayed or never developed.  As a result, CEA estimates H.R. 3 would erase a quarter of the expected gains in life expectancy in the United States over the next decade. The preliminary CBO analysis of H.R. 3 does not account for the additional costs that would burden families and the Federal Government due to the unavailability of lifesaving and cost-reducing medicine that would otherwise exist.  For example, an Alzheimer\u2019s cure, or new treatments for site specific cancers or diabetes, may be delayed or never developed under the regime imposed by H.R. 3.  Thus, the cost of caring for a growing and aging population with direct care, skilled nursing, and home health could be substantially greater than the drug-cost savings estimated by CBO.  More importantly, the effects of these cost increases on individuals and their families will be significant, personal, and long-lasting.  This legislation does include important policies championed by the Trump Administration to lower prescription drug costs.  These include establishing a cap on out-of-pocket expenses for all beneficiaries in Medicare Part D and simplifying and improving that program. H.R. 3 also would limit annual price increases of certain drugs in Medicare to the rate of inflation, protecting beneficiaries and taxpayers from excessive price hikes. These provisions reflect the Administration\u2019s priorities, although modifications should be made to strike a better balance in protecting beneficiaries, taxpayers, and innovation. The Administration strongly prefers the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019, which was reported out of the Senate Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis.  This legislation offers a sound approach to delivering relief to seniors from high prescription drug costs while safeguarding the ongoing development of life-saving and sustaining medicines. Additionally, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, shares many of the same bipartisan elements of the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act and is also a far better approach to lowering drug prices and discovering life-saving cures than H.R. 3. The President believes there is a path forward to enacting bipartisan legislation that lowers prescription drug costs for American families. The Administration remains committed to working with both parties to pass legislation that will lower drug costs while encouraging innovation in the development of lifesaving medicines. If H.R. 3 were presented to the President in its current form, he would veto the bill. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of  H.R. 5543, which would prohibit Federal funds  from being used to pay  for military  force in or  against  Iran and could endanger  the President\u2019s  ability to defend United States forces  and interests in the region against ongoing threats from  Iran and its proxies.  Iran  has  a long history of attacking  United States and Coalition forces both directly  and through its proxies, including, most recently, in a January 7 missile attack from Iran  against United States  forces stationed at two bases in Iraq.  Over the last  several months, Iran, acting  through Qassem  Soleimani  and the  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force, planned and supported a series of escalating attacks by  Iranian-directed Shia militia groups on Coalition  bases throughout  Iraq.  These attacks included the December 27, 2019, assault on an Iraqi military base, which resulted in the death of  a  United States  citizen and badly wounded four United States  service members, as well as  the subsequent  storming  of  the United States Embassy  in Baghdad.  Following  the successful  United States action to eliminate Soleimani from the battlefield on  January 2  and  Iran\u2019s retaliatory ballistic missile attack,  Iran  may be  refraining  from further aggression.  This  legislation would undermine the  Administration\u2019s reestablishment of deterrence  with Iran, which could perversely make violent conflict with Iran more likely.   Additionally, H.R. 5543 would hinder the President\u2019s ability to protect United States diplomats, forces, and interests in the region from the  continued threat posed by  Iran and its proxies.  Specifically, H.R. 5543\u2019s express bar  on the obligation or expenditure of any funds  for any use of  military force against  Iran absent a prior  authorization by Congress could interfere with the President\u2019s ability to protect United States interests in the region, including  the ability to protect  United States  citizens and allies and partners, including  Israel.  H.R. 5543 also  presents  Constitutional concerns  because it seeks to  limit the  President\u2019s authority  as Commander  in  Chief  to direct forces to engage  in hostilities of limited nature, scope, and duration in order to protect important national interests, including the defense of the nation and its  forces  against imminent threats.   See U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1.

This legislation would undermine the positive steps already being taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ensure that broker-dealers act in the best interests of their customers.  These steps include adopting Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) and a new short-form client relationship summary disclosure (Form CRS).  Reg BI and Form CRS enhance existing legal requirements under the Federal securities laws, to the benefit of retail customers.  They help ensure that retail investors are not only well served by their broker-dealers, but also understand the duties and obligations of their broker-dealers.  Before adopting Reg BI and Form CRS, the SEC undertook a lengthy notice and public comment process, which generated comments that it considered and incorporated into the final regulation and disclosure.  The SEC also conducted a robust cost-benefit analysis of Reg BI and investor testing on the proposed Form CRS prior to their final adoption.  As a result, H.R. 1815 would duplicate the efforts the SEC has already taken and effectively delay the full implementation of the important investor protections.

H.J. Res. 76 would restore  the partisan regulatory regime of the previous administration, which sacrificed the interests of  taxpayers, students, and schools in pursuit of  narrow, ideological objectives.  The Trump Administration\u2019s  rule establishes  a clear  standard for borrower  defenses to repayment, providing transparency  to both students  and institutions.  If  a student enrolls  at an institution based on a knowing misrepresentation, the rule provides  that  student  with  a  fair  process  to obtain  debt relief.  Additionally, the rule  helps  support  students  affected by school  closures by extending the window  to qualify  for  loan discharge and by encouraging schools to  provide high-quality  teach-outs  that enable students to  complete their  programs.   The Trump Administration\u2019s rule restores due process, the rule of law, and student choice.  H.J. Res. 76 would also overturn important steps  this Administration  has taken  to hold schools  accountable.  The  Department of Education has  a  dual responsibility to ensure that all institutions  participating in the Federal  student  aid program comply  with legal requirements  and to provide  equitable  treatment for all borrowers  when adjudicating borrower defense to repayment claims.   The previous  administration instituted  a regulatory  regime designed to allow the  Federal  Government and State attorneys  general  to pick winners  and losers  at  considerable cost to  taxpayers.  Politically  motivated regulatory actions  facilitated and encouraged by the previous  rules  forced precipitous  school closures that hurt  students  and taxpayers.  The Trump Administration\u2019s rule, by contrast, fairly holds all institutions  to clear standards of  accountability  and allows the Department of Education to respond quickly and decisively  to early signs of  financial instability.    The Trump Administration\u2019s borrower defense rule puts  students first and ensures  that student  borrowers  who have been defrauded by an institution of higher education have access to  individualized debt relief.  By  overturning this rule, H.J. Res. 76 would undermine the ability  of  students to make educational  choices  that meet their needs.  If  H.J.

The current situation at the Southern Border presents a humanitarian and security crisis that threatens core national security interests and  constitutes a national emergency.   The Southern Border is a major entry point for criminals, gang  members, and illicit narcotics.  The problem of large-scale unlawful migration through the  Southern Border is  enduring, and, despite the Administration\u2019s  use  of existing statutory  authorities, in recent  years  the situation has worsened in certain respects.  In particular, we  have recently  seen sharp increases in the number of  illegal entrances into the United States of family  units, unaccompanied minors, and persons  claiming a  fear of return\u2014aliens whom the  Administration is largely unable to detain or remove because of  antiquated laws and problematic  court decisions.  The resolution would terminate the national emergency  declared by the President on February  15, 2019, and undermine  the Administration\u2019s ability to respond effectively  to the ongoing crisis  at the Southern Border.   The President\u2019s  emergency declaration, and his further determination that the emergency requires the use of the Armed  Forces, allowed the President to invoke  the construction authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2808, and made  that authority  available to the  Secretary of Defense, within his discretion, to undertake  military construction  projects that are necessary to support such use of the Armed  Forces.

H.R. 9 is inconsistent with the President\u2019s  commitment to put American workers  and families  first, promote  access to affordable,  reliable energy  sources and technologies, and improve the  quality of life  for all Americans.  On June 1, 2017, the President announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement and to end implementation of the United States\u2019 nationally determined contributions.  In the announcement he stated: \u201cThe  Paris Accord  would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose  unacceptable legal  risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the  world.\u201d   Implementation of  the nationally determined contribution put forward by the United States under the  Paris  Agreement would entail  billions of dollars in costs and put millions of  American  jobs at risk, including those  in energy-intensive industries, while other countries did not take on similarly stringent commitments.   Despite the enormous domestic costs, under  the Agreement  emissions are expected to  continue to grow internationally, including in countries  that are major economic competitors  of the United States, placing our country  at a competitive  disadvantage.   American ingenuity and innovation have made  the United States  a world  leader  in supplying  affordable, abundant, and secure energy, both domestically  and to our allies, while also reducing  emissions and improving air quality  and public health.  The United States  has had the largest  absolute decline in energy-related  carbon dioxide emissions among all countries since 2000, according to the  International Energy Agency.  From 2005 to 2017, our energy-related carbon  dioxide emissions declined 14 percent, according  to the United States Energy  Information Administration, even as  global emissions grew by 21 percent.  The Administration supports a  strong economy and access to affordable, reliable energy. These are integral to advancing  clean  and efficient technologies through innovation, the development of modern resilient  infrastructure, and protecting our environment.

Current law fails to provide  adequate protections, including  adequate requirements for the  provision of medical care, for vulnerable newborns who survive an abortion attempt.  If enacted, S. 311 would require  any healthcare practitioner who is present at the time that such a child is born to exercise care to preserve the child\u2019s life  and health, and to ensure the child is immediately  transported  and admitted to a hospital.  The bill would also require a healthcare practitioner, or hospital employee, to immediately  report a violation of  these requirements.  S. 311 would establish  a civil right of action  for, and prevent criminal prosecution and penalties from  being brought against, the mothers of such children. The bill draws a sorely needed bright line of protection around abortion survivors by requiring  that they be  given the same level of care as any other premature infant.   A baby that survives an abortion and is born alive  into this world should be treated just like any other baby born alive.

H.R. 8 would require that  certain  transfers,  loans, gifts, and sales of  firearms be processed by  a federally licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer of firearms. H.R. 8 would therefore impose permanent record-keeping requirements and limitless fees on these everyday transactions.  H.R. 8 contains very narrow exemptions from these requirements, and these exemptions  would not sufficiently protect the Second Amendment right of individuals to keep and bear  arms.  For  example,  unless an exemption applies, both the act of leaving  a weapon in the temporary care of  a neighbor while traveling and the act of later  retrieving that weapon would require processing by a  licensed entity under H.R. 8.  Also, unless such an exemption applies, domestic violence victims  would be prohibited from borrowing a  firearm for self-defense without  first having the  transaction go  through such a licensed entity.  The extensive regulation required by H.R. 8 is incompatible with the Second Amendment\u2019s guarantee of an individual right to keep arms.  By overly  extending the  minimum time that a licensed entity is required to wait for background check results, H.R. 1112 would unduly impose burdensome delays on individuals  seeking to  purchase  a firearm.   For this reason, the Administration opposes the legislation.  H.R. 1112 would require a federally licensed firearms  importer, manufacturer, or  dealer that initiates a  mandatory background check on an individual seeking to purchase a  firearm to wait ten business  days  on results  before processing the transaction.  If the Federal  Government fails to complete  the background check within  this window of  time, the individual seeking to purchase the firearm  may petition the  Government for permission to proceed with the transfer. Under H.R. 1112, the licensed entity  would be  required to wait an additional ten business days after such a  petition is  filed before it is  allowed  to proceed with  processing the transaction.  Currently, such background checks are considered  invalid 30 calendar days  after the date the licensed entity initiated them.   As the bill  is written,  therefore, an individual must file their petition on the earliest day possible.  If they fail to do so, H.R. 1112 would effectively  prohibit  some firearms purchases  from being  processed because the  initiated  background check would be considered invalid  before the end of  the second ten-business-day  waiting period.  Allowing the  Federal  Government to restrict  firearms purchases  through bureaucratic delay  would undermine the Second Amendment\u2019s   guarantee that  law-abiding citizens  have an  individual right to keep and bear arms.

At the President\u2019s direction, on January 2, the United States military successfully executed a  strike  in Iraq that killed  Qassem Soleimani, the Commander of the  Islamic Revolutionary Guard  Corps-Qods Force, a designated foreign terrorist organization.  Soleimani was  personally  responsible for terrible atrocities.  He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching  terror strikes  against civilian targets.  He  fueled bloody civil wars all across the region.  He  directed and facilitated actions that viciously wounded and murdered thousands of United States  troops, including by planting bombs that maim and dismember their victims.   In  eliminating  Soleimani from the battlefield, the President took action to  stop a war, not to start a war.  He took action to protect our diplomats, our  service members,  our allies, and all Americans.    Although concurrent resolutions like H.Con.Res. 83 lack the force of law under controlling  Supreme Court precedent, I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), it is nevertheless important to highlight some of its deficiencies.    First, H.Con.Res. 83 is unnecessary because the  military actions to which it applies are already  authorized by law, including the Authorization for  Use of Military Force  Against  Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public  Law 107-243) (\u201c2002 AUMF\u201d).  The 2002 AUMF provides  specific statutory  authorization to engage in military action to \u201cdefend the national security of the United States  against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.\u201d  Public  Law 107-243, \u00a7 3(a)(1).  The United States  forces that have been threatened by  Iranian and  Iran-backed attacks in  Iraq are there to combat  terrorist groups\u2014such as  ISIS.  Thus, in addition to acting in accordance with his Constitutional  authorities as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, the President also acted against  Soleimani pursuant to existing statutory  authorization.  The 2002 AUMF  has always been  understood to authorize the use of force  for, among other purposes, addressing terrorist threats\u2014 like Soleimani and the attacks he was planning and facilitating\u2014emanating from Iraq.   This is consistent with actions taken by previous Presidents pursuant to the 2002 AUMF.  For example,  during the last administration,  United States forces  frequently conducted operations in response  to attacks and threats by  Iran-backed militias in  Iraq under the  authority  conferred by  the 2002 AUMF.  Moreover, the  Administration\u2019s engagement with Congress on this strike has been fully   in accordance  with past precedent, including by providing notification consistent with the War  Powers Resolution and by  briefing Congressional  leadership, the full membership of the House  and Senate, and appropriate staff.  Second, were provisions like those included in H.Con.Res. 83 to become law, they could undermine the President\u2019s ability to defend United States forces  and interests in the region against ongoing threats from  Iran and its proxies.  Iran has  a long history of attacking United  States and coalition forces  both directly  and through its proxies, including, most recently, by  means of a January 7 missile attack from  Iran against United States forces stationed at two bases  in Iraq.  Over the last several months, Soleimani  planned and supported these escalating  attacks  by Iranian-directed Shia militia groups  on coalition bases  throughout  Iraq.   He orchestrated the December 27, 2019 attack on an Iraqi military base, which resulted  in the death of a United  States  citizen  and badly wounded four United States  service members.   Soleimani also  approved the subsequent attack later that month on  the United States Embassy in Baghdad, which turned violent and damaged  the  Embassy facility.   At the  time of  the January 2 strike, Soleimani  was  in Iraq in violation of a United Nations Security Council travel ban and was  actively developing  plans to imminently  attack United States diplomats and service members in  Iraq and throughout  the region.   Subsequently, Iran launched an  attack  against the United States.  Were Congress to  attempt to compel the President to adhere to a resolution like H.Con.Res. 83, it could hinder the  President\u2019s ability to protect United States forces and interests in the region from the continued threat posed by  Iran and its proxies.  This concurrent resolution is misguided, and its adoption by Congress could undermine the  ability of the United States to protect American citizens whom  Iran continues to seek to harm.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of  H.R. 2574.

Sandoval,  532 U.S. 275 (2001), which held that there is no implied private right of action to enforce \u201cdisparate-impact\u201d  regulations adopted by Federal agencies under  Section 602 of  Title VI.  Granting a private cause of action for enforcement of such regulations would inevitably  lead to a massive expansion of litigation  involving  recipients of Federal  financial assistance, diverting resources toward litigation and away from education.   Additionally, the bill would require each recipient of Federal financial assistance to appoint a compliance  coordinator, which would impose additional compliance and administrative burdens on  such entities  as well as on the Department of Education\u2019s  Office for Civil Rights  (OCR), which would be responsible for enforcing this requirement.  It would also subject such entities to liability based on cleverly aggregated and manipulated statistics, rather than facts that establish actual wrongdoing.  Finally, the proposed creation of the position of Special Assistant for Equity and Inclusion within  the Department of Education  would confuse and potentially undermine OCR\u2019s  enforcement of Title VI.  This new position would overlap with the longstanding role of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights,  as well as the  responsibilities of  OCR,  to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational excellence through vigorous enforcement of civil rights in our Nation\u2019s schools.  H.R. 2574  would redirect vital resources  that are  needed to serve students in  the  pursuit of  an ideological agenda.  This  Administration  will continue  to put students first and faithfully enforce Title VI while  rejecting  attempts to impose a burdensome regulatory regime and untold litigation costs  on  well-meaning educators.  If H.R.  2574 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of H.R. 3525, the U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening Standards Act, and the Manager\u2019s Amendment to H.R. 2203, the Homeland Security Improvement Act.  Both bills represent misguided efforts to micromanage the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ignore ongoing efforts within DHS to achieve similar objectives.  In addition, both bills raise resource concerns and, arguably, could force a diversion of resources away from other DHS responsibilities. H.R. 3525 purports to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to research additional approaches to providing medical screening to individuals in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody.  The bill also purports to require DHS to develop an electronic health record system for use by all DHS components operating along the borders of the United States for individuals in custody.  Additionally, the requirement to establish a departmental electronic health record system likely could not be implemented within the allotted 90 days. The Administration takes seriously the United States Government\u2019s obligation to care for those in its custody and to treat individuals with dignity and respect.  CBP is working to expand its medical care contracts across the Southwest Border to increase medical assessments upon entering into CBP custody.  CBP Directive 2210-003, CBP Interim Enhanced Medical Efforts (January 2019), requires a health interview for anyone in CBP custody under the age of 18, and in some cases, for adults.  The directive outlines when a medical assessment is required, and establishes procedures for referrals of those who may require higher levels of medical care. CBP is reviewing its practices related to the care of migrants in its custody and is working to develop a final medical directive.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to improve medical care for those in CBP custody. The Manager\u2019s Amendment to H.R. 2203 purports to establish an Office of the Ombudsman for Border and Immigration Enforcement Related Concerns, which would be an independent entity within DHS responsible for assisting individuals in resolving complaints against CBP, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and their associated entities.  The duties assigned to this Ombudsman and the context in which this officer would perform such duties would not be akin to other DHS officials who serve in an ombudsman or oversight capacity.  Moreover, the Manager\u2019s Amendment would vest this Ombudsman with authorities and responsibilities that are currently reserved to, and would needlessly duplicate the functions of, other DHS  officers, such as the DHS Inspector General.  Moreover, the Manager\u2019s Amendment would require the Ombudsman to appoint a Border Community Liaison in each Border Patrol Sector for the purpose of fostering cooperation between CBP, ICE, and border communities, as well as consulting on policy and program development.  CBP and ICE should and do represent themselves before border communities without relying on an independent entity to broker dialogue with their stakeholders. Creating a duplicative office for these purposes could actually reduce DHS\u2019s oversight and liaison effectiveness by splintering efforts and obfuscating responsibility. * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 1309, which would require the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue an interim final standard addressing workplace violence in the healthcare and  social service sectors.   This legislation  mandates adopting  California\u2019s healthcare workplace violence standards nationwide, which would undercut important principles of federalism and could put workers\u2019 health and jobs in jeopardy.  Additionally, the  bill  would exempt this regulation from many procedural protections designed to ensure that OSHA rulemakings both protect workers and are economically feasible to implement.  The Administration believes that one  State\u2019s  standards may not be  suitable  standards  for all areas  of the country.  California\u2019s standards  may  not  appropriately  protect  workers  in every  State, and California\u2019s  standards may  not  be economically  or technologically feasible or appropriate for  every  State.   At a minimum, the Administration does not support turning one State\u2019s standard  into  a national standard without a cost-benefit analysis to assess whether doing so might benefit workers.  The  Administration  also believes  the bill\u2019s timelines for issuing the  interim  final, proposed  final,  and final  standards are inappropriate.  Notably,  OSHA has already announced plans  for  a Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) panel  to address these issues.   The Administration does not support legislation requiring OSHA to short-circuit that  SBREFA  process.  The  Administration  believes  that  workplace violence is  a serious concern.  This bill, however, is not the  right  way to  protect American  workers.  If H.R. 1309 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.   * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration  supports efforts  to protect homeowners and renters experiencing financial  hardships during the coronavirus pandemic, but it opposes H.R. 7301.  This bill represents misguided Federal overreach into mortgage  and housing markets that fails to account  for actions  that  the Administration has already taken.  H.R. 7301 also includes burdensome new  mandates  that will ultimately complicate existing Federal,  local, and private efforts to respond to the coronavirus.    This bill would authorize almost $200 billion in unsustainable and ineffective Federal subsidies  that do nothing to address the pressing need of getting Americans back to work and restarting our  economy.  Further, the House is rushing this bill  through its process and seeking to push taxpayer  dollars out  the door before States and localities have fully used existing CARES  Act  assistance.   There is no  evidence of  a need for these additional subsidies.    Throughout  the coronavirus outbreak, the Administration has  worked tirelessly to mobilize our  Nation\u2019s vast resources.   On four separate occasions, the President has worked with Congress in a bipartisan manner to respond to the outbreak by enacting legislation of unprecedented size and breadth.  The President  has signed legislation that includes almost $2.5 trillion in spending to improve public health, provide housing support, assist  small  businesses, and  help individuals and families  bridge the gap as they deal  with the challenges presented by the coronavirus.   The Administration has  also acted swiftly to  provide  relief for homeowners and renters.  It has implemented foreclosure and eviction moratoriums, mortgage forbearance, and other  CARES  Act protections.  Additionally, Federal agencies  have provided streamlined options under  existing authorities  to help eligible  borrowers on forbearance become current on their mortgages  without having to make large lump sum repayments.     The  Administration remains  committed to working with Congress in a bipartisan manner  to  assist  families who have been affected by the coronavirus.  This proposed legislation, however, is more concerned with delivering on longstanding partisan and ideological wish lists  than with enhancing the ability of  our Nation to deal with the public health and economic challenges we  face.  When additional legislation is  considered, it should focus on restarting the American economy, putting Americans back to work, renewing American manufacturing dominance, and rebuilding America\u2019s infrastructure.  By focusing on these priorities and building on positive  steps the Administration  has already taken, Congress can more effectively protect homeowners  and renters and support  our economic comeback.   If H.R. 7301 were presented to the President, his  advisors would recommend that he  veto the bill.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of  H.J. Res 37, a joint resolution that purports to direct the President to remove  United States forces  from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of  Yemen, with certain  exceptions.   The premise of the joint resolution is flawed. Since 2015, the United States has provided limited support to member countries of the Saudi-led  coalition, including intelligence sharing, logistics  support, and, until recently, aerial refueling, to assist in the defense of United States  allies and partners. The provision of this support has not caused United States  forces  to be introduced into hostilities.  Such support is provided pursuant to licenses and approvals under the Arms Export  Control Act, statutory authorities  for Department  of Defense to provide logistics support to foreign countries, and the President\u2019s constitutional powers. Because  the President has directed  United States forces to support the Saudi-led coalition under his constitutional powers, the joint  resolution would raise serious constitutional concerns to the extent it seeks to override the  President\u2019s determination as Commander in Chief. In addition to its erroneous premise, the  joint resolution would harm bilateral relationships in the  region, negatively  affect  our ability to prevent the  spread of violent extremist organizations\u2014 such as al-Qa\u2019ida in the  Arabian Peninsula and ISIS in Yemen\u2014and establish bad  precedent  for future legislation by  defining \u201chostilities\u201d to include defense cooperation such as aerial refueling  for purposes of this legislation. While we appreciate that sections 4 and 5 of  the resolution acknowledge  these serious consequences to some extent, after-the-fact reporting is not an effective means to mitigate  them. Our continued cooperation with regional  partner nations  allows  the United States to support diplomatic negotiations to end the  conflict, promote humanitarian access,  mitigate civilian  casualties,  enhance efforts to recover  United States hostages in Yemen, and defeat terrorists  who  seek to harm the United  States.  If H.J. Res. 37 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the  joint resolution.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration  strongly opposes H.R. 6, the  American Dream and Promise Act  of 2019.  H.R. 6 would incentivize and reward illegal  immigration while ignoring  and  undermining  key Administration  immigration objectives and policy priorities, such as protecting our communities  and defending our borders.  The Administration has put forward proposals to address the status of the hundreds of thousands  of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and Deferred  Enforced  Departure  (DED) recipients, but only in the context of  actual  solutions that  would address the underlying problems in our immigration system.  In contrast, H.R. 6 would  only exacerbate illegal immigration and the  exploitation of our  immigration laws by incentivizing more illegal behavior while doing nothing to address the  problems at our southern border or broader immigration enforcement  efforts.  H.R. 6 would also  continue the cycle of our  broken immigration system that encourages people to break the law  at  the expense of those who follow the rules.  For example, it would explicitly  ignore those who proactively committed immigration fraud, which would be  a slap in the face to those who chose  to enter our country legally and who are currently  waiting  to become American citizens.   Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this legislation will increase budget deficits by  more than $30 billion, a cost  primarily  driven by  increased spending on Obamacare subsidies, Medicaid, the  Children\u2019s Health  Insurance Program, Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program, and Federal student aid for this population of newly legalized immigrants. Rather than sending a signal that will invite more people to illegally  enter our  country, the Administration urges the  Congress to focus on real solutions to address the problems within our  immigration system.  In the short term, that means providing the  supplemental resources the Administration  has requested to address  the humanitarian crisis at the  southern border, including  funding for the care of thousands of unaccompanied alien children.  It means working to pass legislation to  close the loopholes that are driving the current exploitation of our asylum system  and that lead to catch and release.  It means providing funding for the construction of the wall in priority locations identified by the Border Patrol to impede and deny the  flows of illegal immigrants, drugs, and other illicit activities.  It means  moving toward a merit-based  immigration system  that prioritizes  high-skilled immigration.  No compromise is possible without both sides coming to the table, and no compromise is  worthwhile that does not  address real underlying problems and improve our immigration system. President  Donald J. Trump remains committed to working in a bipartisan manner to fix our   immigration system, but the Administration will not accept stand-alone policies that undermine  its  core immigration policy  goals.

As written, the FAIR Act disregards the benefits of resolving disputes through arbitration, including lower costs, faster resolution, and reduced burden on the judiciary.

Res.) 77, 78, 79, and 80, disapproving the  Foreign Military Sale of  certain  defense articles, defense services, and  technical data to the  United Arab Emirates  (UAE).  On September 15, 2020, the United States, Israel, the UAE, and  Bahrain signed the historic Abraham Accords  Declaration, normalizing  the UAE-Israel and  Bahrain-Israel bilateral  relationships, the first such breakthrough for Middle East peace since Israel and Jordan  normalized relations in 1994. These  sales  to the UAE that would be affected by  the joint resolutions directly support the  foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States, including those reflected in the Abraham  Accords.  They do so by enabling  the UAE  to deter increasing  Iranian  aggressive behavior and threats issued in the wake of that peace deal.  Since the UAE\u2019s announcement of its  intent to normalize relations with  Israel under the  Abraham Accords, official Iranian statements  have asserted that \u201cthe  UAE\u2019s betrayal won\u2019t last  long,\u201d  and that its actions  have made it  \u201ca legitimate and  easy target.\u201d   In  addition to making the UAE more  capable of exercising its  inherent right of national  self-defense, if necessary, these sales also improve the UAE\u2019s  interoperability with the United States and our allies and close partners, further enabling joint  confrontation of regional challenges for  years to come. These sales  are consistent with the longstanding  commitment and statutory  obligation of the  United States  to maintain  Israel\u2019s  Qualitative Military Edge (QME).  The Department of State, in  consultation with the Department of Defense, has included in its certification to Congress  a determination  that these sales will not adversely affect  Israel\u2019s QME.  In  a joint statement on October 23, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  and Defense Minister Benny  Gantz  endorsed the delivery of  advanced defense capabilities to the UAE, noting the commitments  by the United States  to maintain  Israel\u2019s QME.  Transfer of  enhanced capabilities to a partner after  normalization of relations with  Israel is consistent with decades-long United States  precedent.   The United States provided enhanced security capability to Egypt  following its 1979 normalization of relations with  Israel,  and provided enhanced security  capability to Jordan following its 1994 normalization of relations with  Israel.   Additionally, these sales solidify  our Nation\u2019s  position as the security partner of choice for the UAE and others in the  region.  Through the  Abraham Accords  and through its request for these sales, the UAE has sent a strong signal to other  global powers  regarding the strength of its  partnership with the United States.  Further, the United States provision of enhanced capabilities  to a partner that has normalized relations with Israel encourages other partners to follow the  same path.  Since the August 2020 announcement of the Abraham Accords  by Israel,  the UAE,  and the United States, Bahrain and Sudan have also announced normalization of relations with  Israel.    Additionally, consistent with the President\u2019s Conventional Arms Transfer  Policy, all arms  transfers to foreign partners are subject to a case-by-case comprehensive assessment of United States  interests.  This assessment includes an analysis of the risk of misuse, technology security, and civilian casualties.   Congress has been notified of these assessments,  and these assessments  express  confidence that the  UAE is capable of protecting the technologies involved and of using  them in a responsible manner.  The United States has undertaken many  actions to help  its partners, including the UAE, strengthen their compliance with international law, including the law of armed conflict.  The  United States has also taken actions to help the UAE  mitigate the  risk of civilian  harm, including  training and advising to improve its targeting processes.  Legislation like these resolutions could, without further examination, have unintended consequences for defense procurement and interoperability between  the United States and our partners, and could create diplomatic and security opportunities for our adversaries to exploit.   If the President were presented with  any of these joint resolutions, his advisors would recommend he veto them.  ", "The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3239 as currently written due to its significant legislative  shortcomings.  The bill purports to establish humanitarian standards for individuals in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody by establishing  minimum  standards of healthcare, hygiene, food, and shelter.  As  written,  however, the  bill would go far beyond establishing humanitarian standards for short-term detention, and would require the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  to provide comprehensive healthcare services in  short-term detention  facilities.  The  Administration  is committed  to  the  humane  treatment  of migrants within its custody, including at CBP short-term facilities.   If fully implemented,  however, the  bill would require a  complete overhaul of  CBP facilities, increase staffing  requirements beyond currently funded levels, and significantly increase the  amount of  time  migrants spend in short-term  CBP custody.  These results are not  in the best interests of  either  migrants or  the  United States.  The Federal Government  currently takes extensive measures to ensure the humane treatment  of  migrants  within  its custody.  Short-term detention  by CBP  is governed by the National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (TEDS), which sets forth comprehensive, publicly available standards  for  CBP  facilities.  In accordance with  TEDS, CBP treats at-risk populations, including children, UACs, pregnant individuals, and those with mental, physical, or developmental disabilities, with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerabilities.  CBP also fulfills the requirements set forth by  TEDS to  examine  migrants  for any sign of injury, illness, or health concern.  CBP  also  conducts medical  screenings of  aliens  entering its  facilities.  The health screenings that H.R. 3239 would require over and above what CBP already provides would divert critical time and resources away from individuals who need care and impose tremendous burdens on CBP personnel and resources.  They would  require significant time to  complete and  require extensive testing, regardless of  claims or  the appearance of injury or illness.  As  a result, the  bill would  significantly increase  aliens\u2019 time in CBP custody,  which is  not in the best interest of the aliens,  as CBP facilities are not designed for  long-term detention.  The bill would also require CBP to hire or contract for additional medical professionals, mental health and other specialists, and chaperones.  CBP is  a law  enforcement, national security  organization and is not funded, equipped, or staffed to provide the level of medical care required  by this bill.  In order to alleviate pressures on CBP capacity, funding should be provided for additional long-term detention  capacity with  Immigration  and  Customs Enforcement (ICE)  and   with respect to  the care  and custody of unaccompanied alien children, the  Department of  Health  and Human Services (HHS).  Added  capacity at  these agencies would far  better serve the bill\u2019s  apparent purpose of improving the medical care provided to migrants while  further advancing  their interests by facilitating  their expeditious removal from short-term detention.   Additionally, the bill would require a  wholesale  reconfiguration of CBP\u2019s  short-term detention  facilities by  requiring that space  be available  for  medical staff  and other facilities adjustments.  Notably, the bill would require CBP to maintain facility occupancy  ceilings even during surge  periods, which would undermine full enforcement of our immigration laws.  The bill would also require CBP to make changes to its facilities that would be inconsistent with, and potentially  even impede, its law enforcement mission.   Taken together, various provisions of the bill would require  extensive and costly facility renovations or expansions to many CBP facilities along the  United States southern border \u2013 without providing  any  funding to bring the facilities into  compliance.  The Congress  earlier this month  passed a $4.6 billion humanitarian border  supplemental that  provided much needed emergency  resources and support to DHS, HHS, and the Departments of  Justice and Defense.  Many of these resources are  being deployed to ensure alien children and families receive the care and attention they deserve and are treated fairly  and humanely  while in  Federal custody.  Further, both DHS and HHS have instituted and maintain rigorous  accounting  of those in Federal custody, which is reflected in publicly available and periodically updated reports.   The Administration supports legislation that would assist CBP, ICE, and HHS in meeting the  humanitarian needs of those in their custody.  However, as written, H.R. 3239 would place  onerous requirements on CBP, while possibly hindering its law  enforcement mission and diverting scarce resources away from migrants in need of care.  The Administration looks  forward to working with the Congress on reforms that improve conditions for migrants in CBP  custody without exacerbating the challenges CBP faces in managing the surge of migrants  across the United States southern border.  If H.R. 3239 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. * * * * * * * 2   ", "The Administration is also concerned about the  bill\u2019s  allocation  of funds  between base national defense  and Overseas Contingency  Operations (OCO)  accounts\u2014an  allocation that  exceeds the discretionary cap in place under current law.  As outlined in the Budget request, the Administration prefers  to limit base national defense funding to the  current law\u2019s discretionary  cap, while using both OCO and emergency  funding to provide the  additional  necessary resources to support the National Defense Strategy (NDS).  This approach is  vital to ensuring that the  Nation has the funding  necessary  to defend itself without another budget  agreement or legislation increasing the discretionary cap.   The Administration  also has significant concerns  about  several provisions of H.R. 2500.  These provisions would pose serious challenges to continued execution of the NDS and the 2018 Nuclear  Posture Review (NPR); impair  the President\u2019s  authorities, prerogatives, and responsibilities as  Commander  in  Chief;  impede efforts to ensure  border security;  undermine the Nation\u2019s defense  posture; and harm the warfighter.   If H.R. 2500 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. Modification and Clarification of Construction  Authority in the Event of a Declaration of  War or National Emergency (Section 2802).  The Administration strongly  objects to  section  2802 because it would significantly  curtail the authority of the  Department of Defense (DOD)  under 10 U.S.C. 2808 by  imposing spending  caps, limiting the source of  funds, constraining the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s ability to waive laws that impede expeditious response to an emergency, and imposing burdensome congressional reporting requirements.  Section 2808 was originally  enacted to allow for the  adjustment of  military  construction priorities in the event of a declaration  of war or national emergency  and this section would greatly  restrict that ability.       Modification and Technical Correction of Authority for Deployment of  Members of the Armed Forces to  the Southern Land Border of  the United States (Section 1044).   The Administration  strongly  objects to this provision\u2019s 30-day advanced certification and notification requirements.  The requirement would limit the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s ability to use this authority  to respond in a timely manner to emerging U.S. Customs and Border Protection requests for  assistance.   Furthermore, a requirement to give Congress advance notice of  military deployments  would contravene the President\u2019s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.    Prohibition on Use of Department of Defense  Funds  for Construction of a Wall, Fence, or  Other Physical Barrier Along the Southern Border of the United States (Sections 1046 and  2801).   The Administration strongly  objects to  these provisions  because they  would prohibit the  use of  all DOD funds to design or  carry out a project to construct, replace, or modify  a wall, fence, or other physical barrier  along the international border between the  United States and Mexico, increasing risk to our homeland security.  Additionally, these provisions would leave the Secretary  of Defense unable to effectively support use of the Armed Forces in connection with the ongoing  national emergency.   Modification of Authority to  Provide Support to Other Agencies for Counterdrug Activities  and Activities to Counter Transnational Organized Crime  (Section 1011).  The Administration  strongly  objects to this provision, which would remove DOD\u2019s authority to support  United States  law enforcement  agencies by constructing  fences to block drug smuggling corridors across  international borders of the United States.  The provision would also require detailed congressional  notification prior to providing any support to other  United States  departments and agencies.   Specifically, it would significantly impede DOD\u2019s ability to provide ongoing, real-time, and mission-critical linguist and intelligence analysis services; transportation of personnel, supplies,  and equipment involved in active Federal investigations; the detection and monitoring of United States  inbound suspect aerial and surface traffic;  as well as aerial and  ground reconnaissance support to law enforcement partners.      Limitation on General  and Special Transfer Authority (Sections 1001 and 1512).  The Administration strongly  objects to the bill\u2019s significant recommended reductions to the  DOD\u2019s general  and special transfer authorities.  Specifically, section 1001 of the bill would limit DOD\u2019s base budget  general transfer authority to $1 billion in FY 2020, $4 billion below the Budget  request.  The Administration  also objects to section 1001(c) because removing DOD\u2019s authority to reprogram resources in support of the Drug  Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities  would unduly  restrict the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s ability to support United States  interagency  efforts to combat transnational criminal organizations and the influx of opioids and other dangerous narcotics that  kill tens of thousands of Americans  each year.  Section 1512 of the bill would limit OCO special transfer  authority to $0.5 billion in FY 2020, $4 billion below the FY 2020 Budget request.  Limiting DOD\u2019s transfer  authorities would severely  constrain DOD\u2019s ability  to shift funds between  accounts to meet unforeseen or  emerging military  requirements.    Prohibition on Availability of Funds  for Deployment of Low-yield  Ballistic Missile Warhead  (Section 1646).  The Administration strongly objects to provisions that would reduce  funding for  the Trident  II Modification Program and the W76-2 Modification Program, and block deployment  of the system.  As a measured response to a real-world escalatory threat, the W76-2 warhead  2  reinforces the credibility of our deterrence posture and represents a key element of the 2018 NPR.  Blocking deployment would  send a dangerous message to potential adversaries, many of whom are investing  in  their own  modernization priorities, that the  United States is incapable of  adjusting its  nuclear posture despite a worsening nuclear environment.  This  would undermine deterrence and increases nuclear risk to the United States and our  allies.   Intermediate-Range Nuclear  Forces (INF) Treaty  Response Options (Prompt Global Strike  Program Element)  (Section 1684).  The Administration strongly objects to section 1684, which would eliminate $76 million in research and development funding for INF Treaty response options. The reduction would disadvantage the United States in the event that Russia does not return to compliance with its obligations under the INF  Treaty by the August 2, 2019 deadline.  The  Administration continues to have the full support of NATO and other key allies in its response to Russia\u2019s violation; the elimination of the funds in the budget request would lead those allies to  question our resolve in ensuring Russia cannot achieve a military advantage through its violation of the Treaty.   Submission to Congress of Department of Defense Execute Orders  (Section 1082).  The  Administration strongly objects to section 1082, which would mandate the submission to Congress of information that, if disclosed, could impair national security, foreign relations, law enforcement, or the safety of  military operations and personnel.  It thus would contravene the President\u2019s constitutional authority  as Commander in Chief  as well as his constitutional prerogative not to  disclose privileged information. United States  Space Corps  Sections  (921 - 925).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for the establishment of a sixth branch of the Armed Forces focused on space within the Department of the Air Force.  Elevating the space domain to be on par with the air, land, and sea domains is critical to the  Nation\u2019s future defense.   In order to achieve the Committee\u2019s intent, the  Administration requests the inclusion of additional technical and conforming amendments, such as pay and allowances for members of the new Armed Force, retirement of officers  and enlisted  members, and original appointments of commissioned officers.  Finally, the Administration urges  the Committee to consider authorizing the Secretary of Defense to begin transferring appropriate Air Force and non-Air Force personnel to the new Armed Force in FY 2020, and authorize a senior civilian dedicated to the new Armed  Force and the space domain as  a whole.  Modification of Plutonium  Pit  Production Capacity;  Plutonium Sustainment  (Sections 3114  and 4701).  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's proposed reduction of $241.1 million in requested funding for the National Nuclear Security  Administration's (NNSA) plutonium sustainment efforts.  The requested level  is  necessary to meet the military requirement to produce no fewer than 80 pits per year by 2030.  This 32 percent  reduction would significantly delay NNSA's efforts to improve safety and security features while modernizing the stockpile.  Additionally, delaying the pit production program would force NNSA to further increase its future pit production capacity to address plutonium aging, thereby requiring a larger and more costly pit manufacturing capability.  Ground-Based  Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) (Section 4201).  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee\u2019s proposed reduction of $103 million to the GBSD program.  GBSD is 3   required to modernize the nation\u2019s land-based nuclear forces, which are currently dependent upon the Minuteman III system first deployed in the 1970s.  The Air Force is on track to award a  contract for the next phase of the GBSD program in FY 2020.  This funding reduction would prevent the Air  Force from awarding this contract and delay recapitalization of this  leg of the nuclear triad.   NNSA Nuclear Warhead Modernization.   The Administration strongly  objects to the Committee\u2019s proposed funding reductions to several  of NNSA\u2019s nuclear warhead modernization programs.  Reductions to B83 Stockpile Systems  may preclude  NNSA from carrying out NPR  direction to sustain the B83-1 until a suitable replacement is identified.  Such a reduction would undermine NNSA\u2019s  ability to meet warfighter  requirements and force tradeoffs that would impact the reliability of  fielded deterrent systems.    Reductions to the W87-1 Modification Program would delay the program, increase its cost, and jeopardize DOD\u2019s plans to deploy the next generation intercontinental ballistic missile, thereby  increasing risk and costs to maintain and qualify the existing warhead.  The W87-1 will provide  enhanced safety  and security compared to the legacy W78 that it will replace.   Reductions to W80 Stockpile Systems targeted for  a study to help inform Administration views on a nuclear-armed  sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM) would make it impossible to properly assess the viability of  the SLCM and to inform  Congress of the assessment.  Finally, while the Administration  appreciates the increase to NNSA\u2019s cap on  Federal hiring, the reduction to NNSA Federal Salaries  and Expenses would severely impact NNSA\u2019s ability to recruit, hire, and retain the highly skilled workforce needed to provide necessary program and project  guidance and oversight to execute  nuclear security  programs.   Missile Defense Programs  (Section 4201).  The  Administration strongly  objects to the $413 million in  reductions  to the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s (MDA) funding request as well as the re-scoping of  Flight Test Mission-44 (FTM-44) during a period of  escalating threats to the homeland  and our allies.  Specifically, the Administration objects to the $150 million reduction to the  Improved Homeland Defense  Interceptor Program (Redesigned Kill Vehicle).  The reduction would be premature pending the result of DOD\u2019s  analysis of  alternative  courses of action for the  Redesigned Kill Vehicle effort and could cause even further delays to the delivery of 20 additional  Ground-Based Interceptors.  The Administration  also strongly objects to the $42 million reduction to re-scope FTM-44, a  Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block  IIA flight test, from testing against a threat representative  Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) to testing against a threat representative  Intermediate- Range  Ballistic Missile (IRBM).  Section 1680 of  the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018 (Public Law 115-91) directed MDA to conduct an SM-3  Block  IIA flight test against a threat representative ICBM.  The re-scoping to conduct the test against a threat  representative IRBM  rather than an ICBM would prevent MDA  compliance with section 1680.  In addition, the re-scoping of the test to a non-ICBM target would add little technical value, as MDA  has already successfully tested the SM-3 Block  IIA missile against a threat representative  IRBM in  Flight Test Integrate-03 (FTI-03) in December 2018, and also against a threat representative Medium Range  Ballistic  Missile in FTM-45 in October 2018.   4   Next  Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) (Section 4201).   The Administration strongly objects  to the $500 million reduction in the NGAD program.  Full funding for NGAD is  essential to maintaining  a strong United States  industrial base capable of building the world\u2019s most advanced aircraft.  This 50 percent  reduction in funding  would  result in a three-year slip in advanced  aircraft  development timelines and the cancellation of critical  new production technology programs. Reduced funding would also  risk setting the United States behind other nations applying rapidly  evolving digital technology to future  aircraft  programs.  Limitation on Availability of Funds for VC\u201325B Aircraft (Section 125).   The Administration  strongly objects to this provision, which would create significant cost and schedule risk to the VC-25B program.  As such, the program would likely  be exposed to a Request for Equitable  Adjustment stemming from the inability to respond in a timely manner when it is necessary to  utilize over-and-above  funding under the firm-fixed-price contract.  Additionally, it could prevent  resolution of design issues identified during testing that could create operational and security issues  during Presidential missions.    Notification of Delegation of Authorities to the Secretary of  Defense for Military Operations  in Cyberspace (Section  1628).   The Administration strongly objects to this provision, as it would require the Secretary of  Defense to provide Congress with operationally sensitive documents  regarding  authorities delegated by  the President to  the Secretary for military operations in  cyberspace, including execute orders, a list of countries in which such authorities might be  exercised, and defined military objectives  for the  use of such authorities.  This provision would interfere with the established process  for military  operations in cyberspace, unduly hinder  cyber  operations, and contravene the President\u2019s constitutional prerogative not to disclose privileged information, including national security information.   Pilot  Program on  Prosecution of Special Victim Offenses Committed by Attendees of  Military Service Academies  (Section 538).  The Administration strongly  objects to section 538, which would outsource  authority for discipline, as well as undermines commander accountability  and the chain of  command relationship.  The proposal is inconsistent with one of the fundamental  principles of the military  justice system since Congress adopted the  Uniform  Code of Military  Justice in 1950: uniformity.  Creating  a pilot program where one individual is treated differently  than another charged with the same crime may raise fairness  concerns.   Criminal justice systems  should not be  experiments;  neither should accused service members nor victims be treated as  experiments.  Numerous studies of the exercise of  prosecutorial discretion, including in foreign militaries that have empowered lawyers to make charging decisions, have  found no resulting  benefit in sexual assault rates, reporting, investigation, or prosecution.   Restrictions on Detention at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba (Sections 1032 and 1033).  The Administration strongly objects to any  restriction on Law of War  detention.  The Administration  fully intends to keep open the detention facility  at GTMO and to use it for detention operations, and DOD has implemented strict global screening criteria that limit the candidates who  are eligible for detention at GTMO.   If transfers to GTMO were prohibited, as  called for in Section 1033, then, in the future, DOD would be forced to conduct long-term detention of such detainees in-theater or in the continental United States, repatriate them to third  countries, or release detainees.   Furthermore, in certain circumstances, restrictions on the  5   President\u2019s authority to transfer detainees  would violate constitutional separation of powers  principles, including the  President\u2019s authority  as  Commander in Chief.   Detention  Facilities at  GTMO (Section 4602).   The Administration appreciates the  authorization for military  construction  of the Communications Facility, and the Detention  Legal Office and  Communications Center at GTMO.  The Administration strongly objects, however, to the  exclusion of the High-Value Detention Facility. The President has ordered continued detention operations at  GTMO.  The current facility for high-value detainees is experiencing structural  and  system challenges that, if unaddressed, could pose life and safety  risks to both our guard forces  and the detainees.    Limitations on Use of Funds  for Providing Housing for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC)  (Sections 1048 and 1049).  The Administration objects to sections  1048 and 1049 as they  may limit DOD\u2019s ability  to support HHS\u2019s efforts  to house UACs during times of influx. Additionally, section 1049 would require the Secretary of Defense to certify  issues outside the  purview of the Secretary  of Defense.  At the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Secretary of Defense makes  available DOD land  and facilities for use by  HHS.   The Secretary of  HHS determines whether such DOD land  and facilities meet HHS  requirements and standards, including those standards established pursuant to the Flores settlement agreement.  Additionally, DOD support to HHS is on a reimbursable basis.  DOD does not expend DOD funds for this purpose.  Prohibition on the Use of Funds to Suspend, Terminate, or Withdraw the United States from  the Open Skies Treaty (Section 1231).   The Administration  strongly objects to this prohibition, insofar as it purports to impinge on the President\u2019s sole constitutional authority to suspend, terminate, or withdraw from a treaty.  This authority is not conferred by  and cannot be limited by  Congress.  While Congress\u2019s spending power is broad, it cannot be deployed to accomplish unconstitutional ends, including through the use of appropriations restrictions to prevent the  President from exercising his constitutional authority to suspend, terminate, or withdraw from a  treaty.    Replacement of  Fluorinated Aqueous Film-forming Foam with Fluorine-free Fire-fighting Agent (Section 318).  The Administration strongly  objects to this provision, which prohibits DOD  from using fluorinated fire-fighting  foam before a viable equivalent replacement has been  identified.  DOD continues to pursue aggressively a fluorine-free foam, which must be equivalent  in fire-fighting performance and workforce safety as the military specifications.  DOD has  concerns, however, about meeting the 2025 military  specification deadline and the feasibility of  waiver requirements.     Perfluorooctane Sulfonate (PFOS) and  Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA)  Used on Military  Installations (Section 323).  The Administration strongly objects to this provision, which would provide authority to DOD to treat water sources  or provide replacement water for agricultural  purposes where the water source is \u201ccontaminated\u201d with PFOA and PFOS from military  activities.  Using the EPA drinking water health advisory (HA) to identify  areas subject to this  section of the bill would be  inconsistent with the scientific basis of the HA\u2014it was not constructed to determine unhealthy levels of PFOA/PFOS in water used for agricultural  purposes or human 6   health effects from  consumption of foods produced using agricultural water containing  PFOA/PFOS.  Additionally, at potentially  great cost to and significant impact on DOD\u2019s mission, the legislation singles out DOD, only one contributor to this national issue.  Basic Needs Allowance for Low-income Regular Members (Section 602).   The Administration  strongly objects to this provision because it  would be  an unnecessary  entitlement.  Military  members  receive  appropriate compensation already.  Most junior enlisted  members  receive pay  that is between the 95th and 99th percentiles relative to their private-sector peers.  In addition, this  provision would base the allowance upon a member\u2019s household size, potentially including  roommates and unrelated individuals.  The provision would also raise fairness concerns as it would exclude members of the  United States Coast Guard, members assigned outside the United States, and members of the Active Guard  and Reserve.     Integrated  Personnel and Pay System-Army (IPPS-A) (Section 4201).   The Administration  strongly objects to the $43 million reduction in research and development funding from the  FY  2020 Budget request in section 4201 for the  IPPS-A.  The reduction effectively  eliminates  IPPS-A  for  approximately 680,000 soldiers serving  in the Regular Army and Reserves and would put the  Army\u2019s number one personnel modernization effort, which is currently being released to the Army  National Guard, with  approximately  another 335,000 members  at significant risk.   IPPS-A integrates human resource capabilities across all components for the first time, and is the vehicle  for the Army\u2019s Talent Management efforts.  The legislation would also delay the fielding of  IPPS-A to the Army Reserve and Active Duty from 2021 to 2023, significantly undermining  the Army\u2019s  efforts to transform its force, and place  efforts to achieve auditability  at risk.    Authority to Provide Assistance to the Vetted  Syrian Opposition (Section 1222).   The Administration strongly  objects to the 15-day waiting period and hold on funds mandated by this  provision.  These requirements would impede DOD\u2019s ability to provide  continuous, uninterrupted training, and assistance to vetted Syrian Opposition forces, and would have an irreversible  damaging  effect on  the next phases of  DOD\u2019s campaign to defeat  the remaining  ISIS networks in the region.  Furthermore, a requirement to provide Congress  advance notice of military exercises  would contravene the President\u2019s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.    National Security Space Launch Program (Section 1601).   The Administration strongly objects  to this provision as it would increase mission risk  for the Nation\u2019s national security satellites.   After careful and considered study,  DOD determined that a contract for national security space launch requirements over  the course of  five  years  would optimize warfighter flexibility, minimizes  mission risk, and provides exceptional value to the taxpayer.  It would also align with the  conclusion of the current  generation of several satellite architectures.  Confining Phase 2 to fewer  missions would increase  per-launch cost while simultaneously introducing risk and costs for some  intelligence payloads.  Finally, notifying Congress prior to a contract would be a departure  from  long-standing tradition and might put DOD at a  greater risk of a protest.   Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared  (Next-Gen OPIR) (Section 4201).   The Administration strongly  objects to the Committee\u2019s reduction of $376.4 million for the Next-Gen  OPIR program as it would delay delivery by three years and increase overall program costs by over  $475 million.  7    Prohibition on Availability of Funds  for Mobile Variant of Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent  Missile (Section 1645).  The Administration objects to the 10-year extension of the prohibition on the availability of  funds for  a mobile variant of the  GBSD  missile.   The GBSD will  serve as the  ground-based leg of the nuclear triad for decades into the future.  Pursuant to the 2018 NPR, a mobile variant of the GBSD is not currently  required to ensure deterrence, but  changes in  adversary technology (e.g., a breakthrough in anti-submarine warfare), doctrine, and nuclear force  posture may require the  United States to reassess  this determination in the future.   Limitation on Use of Funds  for Implementation  of Elements of Master Plan for Redevelopment of Former Ship Repair Facility in Guam (Section 335).   The Administration  objects to this provision because this funding restriction would impede Navy\u2019s  ability to plan and program projects necessary to best utilize limited real estate  resources to support future mission  growth and advanced  warfighting capabilities.  This restriction  would negatively impact Navy\u2019s  ability to sustain its advantage over peer  competitors, place  warfighters at risk, and create  an  untenable safety risk.     F-15EX  Aircraft Program  (Section 123).   The Administration  objects to section 123, which would designate the F-15EX as a major subprogram of the F-15.  The designation as a major  subprogram would needlessly delay the fielding of the F-15EX by an  estimated two  years while  providing only marginal  decision-making value to the Milestone Decision Authority  given the  F-15EX high level of technology readiness.  The delays  would exacerbate capacity issues  within the  tactical aircraft portfolio, prevent the execution of  key nonrecurring engineering and manufacturing  activities, and require operating the less capable F-15C/D longer with its significant structural issues and high cost.  The Administration  objects to the proposed limitation on procuring only two F-15EX prototypes, and requests full funding  for the first eight F-15EX aircraft.   Unmanned Surface Vessels (Section 4201).   The Administration objects to the proposed $238 million reduction to the Large  Unmanned Surface Vessels.  These vessels  are critical  experimentation vessels with modular payloads to reduce  risk, conduct integration and testing of  payloads, and develop Navy tactics and concepts  of operations necessary to provide a more  distributed  and lethal force.    Reprioritization of Military Construction  Funding to Unrequested Projects  (Section 4601).  The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s proposed realignment of military construction funding  from priority projects to other projects not included in the FY 2020 Budget  request.  Contrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible policy to fully fund projects, the bill proposes to incrementally fund 20 military construction projects, effectively  creating  an unfunded obligation of  $1.4 billion needed to fully fund these projects over time.  In addition, the  bill would divert $1 billion requested in the FY 2020 Budget to fully fund priority projects, or from rescissions of prior year funds, to other unrequested projects.   Low-Enriched  Uranium Naval  Nuclear Fuel R&D Program (Section 3118).  The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s direction to establish a program for development of high-density, low-enriched fuels that could replace highly enriched uranium for naval applications.  In  2018, the Secretaries of  Energy and the  Navy jointly determined that the  United States should not  8   pursue research and development of an advanced naval nuclear fuel system based on low-enriched  uranium since such a system would result in a reactor design that is inherently less capable, more  expensive, and unlikely to support the significant cost savings  associated with life-of-ship submarine reactors.  To fully execute a development effort of this magnitude would also incur  significant risk and compete for resources against other defense priorities.   Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response (NCTIR).  The  Administration objects to the  bill\u2019s reduction of $32 million from the FY 2020 Budget request for the NCTIR program.  This  reduction would compromise NNSA\u2019s ability to speed life-saving  responses to a nuclear incident  in the United States.  Under the Capability Forward model, NNSA would provide enhanced training and equipment to regional Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) teams, enabling them to render safe a nuclear device.  Given the interdependence of  NNSA and FBI in this  initiative, if the  two agencies\u2019 budgets do not remain synchronized, the timeline for fielding enhanced capabilities  to United States  cities will be severely disrupted.   Timely Disposition of Nonprosecutable Sex-Related Offenses (Section 539).  This provision would be inconsistent with existing statutory  requirements, such as forwarding certain non-referral  decisions regarding sexual assault allegations for  higher-level review, and the Administration objects to its inclusion in the final bill.  The provision would include a 90-day deadline that may  preclude command action if  that command action is not concluded within that timeframe,  potentially immunizing misconduct.   Expansion of Special  Victims\u2019 Counsel for Victims of Sex-Related to Domestic Violence Offenses (Section 542).  DOD remains committed to eliminating sex-related and domestic violence offenses.  This provision, however, would decrease access for sexual assault victims to  Special Victims\u2019 Counsels (SVCs)/Victims\u2019  Legal Counsels (VLCs), exacerbate already high  caseloads for SVC/VLCs, and impose an unfunded mandate.    Defense Acquisition Workforce Certification and Education Requirements (Section 841).  The Administration is concerned the provisions included in section 841 would be  premature and overly broad.  DOD\u2019s acquisition workforce is currently subject to requirements of the Defense  Acquisition Workforce  Improvement Act (DAWIA).  Rather than create a  new set of standards and impose additional requirements (which would result in increased costs), DOD  would prefer to continue to evaluate  current workforce needs, and modify the DAWIA  certification program  accordingly.       Federal Transit Dollars (Section 896).  The Administration supports the  efforts of the  Committee, as set forth in section  896, to prevent  financial assistance, specifically  Federal transit  dollars, from being used to award a  contract or subcontract for the procurement of passenger  railcars to priority  enterprises owned, controlled, or subsidized by foreign states.   Telecommunications Services and Infrastructure (Section 852).   The  Administration strongly  supports section 852, which would direct the Secretary of Defense to  award  telecommunications  services and infrastructure contracts only to allowed contractors.  This  provision will improve  security on outlying  United States  national security  installations by  removing a potential 9   vulnerability from  United States systems and will encourage reciprocity in government  procurement practices.    Prohibition on Operation or  Procurement of Foreign-made Unmanned Aircraft Systems  (UAS) (Section 854).   The Administration supports section 854, which would prohibit  procurement by the Secretary of Defense of  UAS manufactured by a  covered foreign country.  The Administration believes  domestic production of these systems is critical for economic and national security interests. Reliance on a covered nation for these aircraft systems presents exceptional risk  to our supply chains and defense.  The exemption and waiver provisions already in section 854 address many  concerns  with the legislation and the Administration looks forward to working with Congress on refining language to include a broader research and development exemption.   Safe-to-Report  Policy (Sections 549 and 560).  The Administration supports programs to minimize barriers to reporting.  However, this provision would provide blanket immunity  and might have the  effect of  undermining the validity  of a victim\u2019s allegations.  Specifically, under this  provision, victims might be subjected to allegations that the report was made merely to escape disciplinary or punitive  action.  This would detract from the victim\u2019s testimony, and might lend itself to injecting doubt into the case.   Afghan Special Immigrant Visas (SIV) (Section 1212).   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of the Afghan SIV program  and inclusion of 300 additional visas.  The Administration urges the  Committee, however, to consider including its full request for 4,000 Afghan SIVs to ensure continued support of the Afghans who have worked alongside our troops  and diplomats.   Foreign Policy and Assistance Related Matters  (Sections 897, 1031, and 1255).   Sections 897, 1031, and 1255, among other provisions, concern foreign policy  and foreign assistance priorities, and while they may advance efforts that the Administration supports, the Administration is  concerned that these provisions do not have a means to ensure in the implementation of these  authorities consistent with United States  foreign policy interests  and to avoid serious unintended consequences.  10  ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act.  H.R. 582 would increase the Federal minimum wage to $15.00 an hour.  The legislation would also phase out the lower minimum wages that apply to newly hired teenagers, end the practice of counting tips toward minimum wage obligations, and completely prohibit tip pooling between restaurant servers and back-of-the-house staff. Through its successful pro-growth economic agenda, the Administration has ensured that American workers are taking home bigger paychecks.  In recent months, the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in nearly a half century, and job openings have risen to a record high.  There are now more than 1.4 million more job vacancies than there are unemployed workers, and the economy is responding by bringing people from the sidelines and into the workforce.  This strong economy has prompted businesses to remain competitive by raising wages.  Compensation is rising at near its fastest pace in a decade. Median household income has reached an all-time high. Wages are also rising faster for production and non-supervisory workers than for workers overall. A $15.00 an hour minimum wage would reverse this economic progress and hurt workers.  H.R.582 would more than double the Federal minimum wage\u2014raising it 45 percent above its inflation-adjusted historical high.  Recent research found Seattle\u2019s $13.00 minimum wage caused hiring to fall so much that total wage payments fell across the city, offering a powerful warning of the devastating effects a $15.00 Federal minimum wage could have on communities across America.  The Congressional Budget Office, for example, recently estimated that H.R. 582 could eliminate up to 3.7 million jobs.  Further, many workers who remain employed would see their compensation fall as hours are reduced and fringe benefits like vacation time are lost. H.R. 582\u2019s changes to tipping rules also would negatively affect restaurant employees.  Preventing tips from counting toward minimum-wage obligations could discourage tipping.  Maine and Washington, D.C., recently repealed similar policies after servers protested that they would cut their pay. Relatedly, this legislation would disrupt well-established compensation structures by prohibiting cooks and dishwashers from sharing in the tips their often unseen work helps generate. The successful efforts to reduce taxes, eliminate regulations, and implement fairer trade deals are driving economic growth and increasing workers\u2019 take-home pay far more effectively and  efficiently than legislation like H.R. 582, which would eliminate jobs and reduce total wages for American workers. If H.R. 582 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 986.  This legislation would nullify  Administration guidance  on section 1332 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA).  This guidance, issued on October 24, 2018, by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of the Treasury,  expanded State flexibility,  encouraging  States to  pursue section 1332 waivers to move their insurance markets away  from  PPACA\u2019s  one-size-fits-all rules and regulations and increase choice and  competition within their insurance markets.  The President has repeatedly made clear that this Administration will protect people with pre-existing conditions.  The 2018 guidance in no way alters the  guardrails in place for those with pre-existing conditions, and it would not allow the Administration to waive  the requirements  in place around pre-existing conditions.  The title of this legislation gives the  misleading impression  that it will enhance healthcare protections for  Americans with pre-existing  conditions.  Members  should not be confused.  This bill would not extend any  additional protections for people with pre-existing conditions.  Rather, it would harm the ability of States to improve coverage  for  people both with and without pre-existing conditions.  Coverage in the individual market has become  increasingly unaffordable  for unsubsidized consumers, including those with pre-existing conditions.  The 2018 guidance freed States to develop health coverage that best meets the needs  of their residents, to better enable  all Americans  to have the opportunity to gain high-value and affordable health  coverage regardless  of income, geography, age, gender, or health status.  It  empowers States to develop innovative  approaches that transcend the inflexible  Federal approach,  increase consumer control, and expand choice and competition in their markets.  The guidance issued by the previous  administration  in 2015 substantially and unnecessarily limited the types of proposals that could be approved for section 1332 waivers, effectively  limiting States\u2019 ability to innovate and impairing their  ability to  meet all the challenges  they  face in providing quality  health coverage to their residents.  H.R. 986 would reverse State efforts to develop innovative waiver proposals  and limit the  Administration\u2019s  ability to  provide  guidance to States about the flexibilities  available  under  the law.  It would move the healthcare market in the wrong direction.  The legislation  threatens  access to healthcare for our Nation\u2019s citizens and runs counter to the President\u2019s  healthcare vision of expanding affordable coverage, improving care  for people with pre-existing conditions, and enhancing  competition.  If H.R. 986 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. ** * * * * *  ", "The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3351, making appropriations for financial services and general government for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes.  The Administration is strongly opposed to the budgetary framework that underlies this and other appropriations bills being considered by the House of Representatives.  This framework would raise the discretionary spending caps by more than $350 billion in fiscal years (FY) 2020 and 2021 and does not reflect either a House-passed budget resolution or a bipartisan, bicameral agreement.  It would put the Federal Government on track to add nearly $2 trillion to deficits over 10 years, adding significantly to the national debt, which is already more than $22 trillion and rising.   In addition, the House Democrats\u2019 framework continues to adhere to the misguided and unfounded notion that increases to defense spending must be matched or exceeded by increases to non-defense spending.  In fact, the appropriations bills under consideration would provide more than twice as much additional funding in FY 2020 for non-defense programs as for defense programs, relative to FY 2019 levels.  Investing in our national security remains a key Administration priority, but strengthening our defense does not require additional non-defense discretionary spending.  Overall, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would appropriate $25.0 billion, which is $0.4 billion, or 1.6 percent, above the FY 2020 Budget request and $1.8 billion above the FY 2019 enacted level.  In addition, this legislation includes a number of particularly problematic provisions implicating key Administration priorities, including provisions that would restrict the Administration\u2019s ability to secure the southern border, impose restrictions on the Administration\u2019s management of the Executive Branch, and allow for Government-funded abortions in the District of Columbia.  If H.R. 3351 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the bill. Department of the Treasury Border Security Infrastructure. The Administration believes that it is essential to fully secure the border, the bedrock of a functioning immigration system.  Language in section 126 of the bill  would severely undermine the Administration\u2019s efforts to do so by restricting the use of certain amounts in the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.  Such amounts are permanently authorized for law enforcement activities of any Federal agency.  The Administration strongly opposes this language, which would hamstring the development of border security infrastructure. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides sufficient resources to support anticipated increases in CFIUS caseload volumes and the investments required to successfully implement the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides $286 million above the amount requested in the FY 2020 Budget for the CDFI Fund.  The Federal Government should not be allocating taxpayer funds to the mature CDFI industry, which should have ready access to private capital.  The requested amount of $14 million is sufficient to support ongoing CDFI Fund activities. Executive Office of the President Poverty Measure. The Administration strongly opposes language in section 634 of the bill that would preclude funds from being used to make changes to the Official Poverty Measure.  The provision would prevent the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from completing its statutory responsibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and would also undermine the established process for reviewing and updating these standards, which is intended to ensure the objectivity and relevance of Federal statistical data. Apportionment Reporting. The Administration strongly objects to section 204 of the bill that would require OMB to create an automated system and website through which each OMB-approved apportionment would be publicly posted, and would require OMB to provide a monthly report to the appropriations committees documenting all apportionment requests that have been with OMB for 30 days or more without being approved. This reporting requirement is unnecessarily onerous as it would require thousands of documents to be posted online each year. Restrictions on Withholding under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA).  The Administration strongly objects to section 750 of the bill which would prohibit withholding from obligation any budget authority proposed for rescission or deferral pursuant to the ICA within 60 days of the expiration of that budget authority.  In addition, this provision would treat any violation of this prohibition as if it were an Antideficiency Act violation. This provision would undermine long-standing budget law and impinge on the President\u2019s ability to exercise fiscal management of the Executive Branch, including by proposing rescissions. Supervision of the Executive Branch.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill includes certain provisions that seek to interfere with the President\u2019s supervision of the Executive Branch, such as one purporting to bar OMB from expending funds to alter the annual work plan of the Army Corps of Engineers, in contravention of the separation of powers between the Executive Branch and the Congress. 2  General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Buildings Fund (FBF). The Administration is disappointed that the bill continues to underfund the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) capital program.  The diversion of receipts fails to provide Federal agencies with the commercial equivalent space and services that agencies pay for in rent.  The bill fails to fund critical construction, renovation, and consolidation priorities within the FBF capital program, including the next phase of construction at the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s consolidated headquarters at St. Elizabeths. Since FY 2011, the Congress has redirected approximately $8 billion in GSA rent receipts to other congressional priorities. Federal Capital Revolving Fund. The Administration continues to support the establishment of a Federal Capital Revolving Fund (FCRF), a new budgetary mechanism for large civilian real property projects. The Administration transmitted legislative language in June 2018 and looks forward to working with the Congress to enact the FCRF proposal. Federal Information Technology (IT) Modernization. The Administration appreciates the continued support for the Technology Modernization Fund with an increase in funding over FY2019 enacted levels.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the full $150 million requested level, which would support a more rapid transition of legacy systems and the adoption of more commercial technology. Small Business Administration (SBA) Entrepreneurial Development Programs. The Administration is concerned that the bill provides $282 million in funding for SBA entrepreneurial development programs, $100 million above the FY 2020 Budget request.  In addition, the Administration is disappointed that the Congress has failed to include the reforms proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request to create a competitive set-aside for the Small Business Development Centers program and to allow for data sharing, which would enable the program to better measure and evaluate effectiveness. District of Columbia (D.C.) D.C. Restrictions. The Administration strongly objects to section 802 of the bill which would amend a previously-enacted provision and would allow for Government-funded abortion in D.C. School Improvement. The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides less for School Improvement than the FY 2020 Budget request; the $53 million provided is $38 million less than the FY 2020 Budget request.  The requested funding is needed to meet family demand for the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) and provide additional support for D.C. public schools and public charter schools.  Instead, the bill would continue to provide funding for the poorly-targeted Tuition Assistance Grants program.  In addition, the Administration is concerned that the bill requires private schools participating in the OSP to certify with the Department of Education that they comply with Federal requirements for which they do not receive funds to implement.  The unprecedented application of such requirements would severely limit private schools\u2019 ability to participate in OSP and therefore seriously reduce the number of high-quality 3  educational options to which disadvantaged D.C. families have access. Other Independent Agencies National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of the $22 million requested to implement NARA\u2019s electronic records initiative, which is part of the Administration\u2019s Government Reform Plan.  These funds would help NARA modernize its work processes and accelerate important electronic records activities. Public Buildings Reform Board (PBRB). The bill fails to fund PBRB and the Asset Proceeds and Space Management Fund, both of which were established under Federal Asset Sales and Transfer Act of 2016.  The Board recently began operations, given that a sufficient number of Board members have been appointed and, absent appropriations in FY 2020, the PBRB would be unable to carry out its mission. Election Assistance Commission. The Administration is disappointed that the bill includes $600 million in unrequested funds for additional election security grants to States.  Securing election infrastructure is a partnership between Federal, State, and local governments and private sector entities.  States have only begun to expend the $380 million received for election security grants in FY 2018.  Additional support from the Federal Government should only be provided once existing funds have been deployed. Other Issues Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Reorganization. The Administration continues to stress structural and organizational reform at OPM, and strongly opposes the inclusion of language in section 632 of the bill prohibiting the merger of OPM with GSA. Reform is needed to better align resources with mission and create long-term stability, sustainability, and increased operational excellence.  In addition, the Administration is also concerned with language in this section prohibiting interagency agreements between GSA and OPM.  Interagency agreements are routinely entered into by agencies for cross-agency support and are mission-critical for OPM to continue to operate.  As worded, the provision would create increased risk of IT system failures, including those with sensitive information concerning current and former Federal employees and their families. Across-the-Board Civilian Pay Increase.  The Administration continues to support the alignment of pay with strategic human capital objectives.  A 3.1 percent pay increase presents long-term fixed costs, yet fails to address the most strategic human capital issues facing the Federal workforce. Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA).  The Administration strongly opposes section 749, which prevents agencies from addressing language in their CBAs that violate Government-wide requirements and limits the authority of the Federal Service Impasses Panel to resolve bargaining impasses. By stipulating that a CBA shall remain in full force and effect until a new bargaining agreement is reached through mutual consent, this provision effectively traps agencies and forces them to remain party to agreements that do not advance the effectiveness or efficiency of the 4  agency\u2019s mission. Public-Private Competition. The Administration is disappointed that the bill continues the moratorium preventing agencies from using public-private competition as a tool for determining whether specific work of the Government should be performed by Federal workers or contractors.  Such a tool would enable more efficient use of resources, helping to achieve important goals of the Administration, including those laid out in the President\u2019s Management Agenda. Constitutional Concerns Certain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, a provision purporting to bar OMB from expending funds to alter the annual work plan of the Army Corps of Engineers would interfere with the President\u2019s supervision of the Executive Branch, a necessary feature of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.  Other provisions would contravene the constitutional separation of powers between the Executive Branch and the Congress, and still another could infringe on the President\u2019s constitutional authority to control the disclosure of information that is subject to executive privilege.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2020 appropriations process moves forward. * * * * * * * 5  ", "The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019.  H.R. 4 would amend the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 by imposing a new coverage formula and transparency obligations on States and local jurisdictions regarding their elections.  These amendments raise serious policy concerns because the Federal Government would be granted excessive control over State and local election practices.  Additionally, the Supreme Court has already held similar restrictions imposed by Congress on States and localities to be unconstitutional.  No individual should be denied or deterred from exercising his or her right to vote.  Federal law protects against voting discrimination, allows judicial review of State and local voting laws, and establishes preclearance requirements. H.R. 4 would overreach by giving the Federal Government too much authority over an even greater number of voting practices and decisions made by States and local governments without justifying the current needs for such policies. Section 3 of H.R. 4 would amend the VRA by setting forth a new coverage formula that subjects certain States and local subdivisions to Federal preclearance requirements before undertaking certain election activities.  For example, the coverage formula would place restrictions on States with \u201c15 or more voting rights violations [that] occurred in . . . the previous 25 calendar years.\u201d Once a State or locality is covered by the formula, it would need permission from the Attorney General or Federal courts before conducting certain election activities prescribed by the bill.   In striking down the VRA\u2019s prior coverage formula, the Supreme Court held that although \u201c[o]ur country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\u201d Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 557 (2013).  Accordingly, the coverage formula set forth in section 3 of H.R. 4 that \u201cimposes substantial federalism costs\u201d on States must therefore be tailored to \u201ccurrent needs.\u201d Id. at 540, 553 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, section 3 continues to permit reliance on potentially decades-old data\u2014incidents dating as far back as 25 years\u2014as a justification for imposing a preclearance requirement.  Additionally, section 4 of H.R. 4 would create a new \u201cPractice-Based Preclearance\u201d standard, which would automatically subject certain election laws to Federal preclearance, thereby raising significant policy concerns.  This section would, among other things, prejudice Federal law  against State and local voter integrity efforts, such as voter ID laws, and even impose requirements on routine administrative actions that include changing voting locations. Finally, H.R. 4 would amend the VRA by imposing additional transparency requirements regarding certain election activities in Federal, State, and local jurisdictions.  Section 5 of H.R. 4 raises constitutional concerns because its broad language would interfere with State and local elections beyond the powers afforded by the Elections Clause.  Specifically, section 5 would require notice of demographic information related to \u201cany change in the constituency that will participate in an election for Federal, State, or local office.\u201d  This broad language would impose notice requirements on States that make redistricting changes despite no Federal election involvement.  By doing so, H.R. 4 would impermissibly grant Congress authority beyond what is authorized by the Elections Clause, and therefore section 5 would likely be found unconstitutional.    In sum, several provisions of H.R. 4 violate principles of federalism and exceed the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution, and these provisions would likely be found unlawful if challenged.  Accordingly, the Administration opposes H.R. 4. If H.R. 4 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1140, which would change how Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees are compensated by making their employment subject to the provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code.  The current personnel system authorized by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) just months after the September 11th attacks provides the flexibility TSA needs so that it can quickly and efficiently adjust its workforce management to respond to emerging threats or national emergencies.  It also benefits the workforce, as reflected in the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Panel, an independent review of TSA\u2019s human capital program conducted in FY 2019 by public and private-sector personnel systems experts.   The Administration is grateful for the dedicated service of the workforce of the TSA, which has remained strong and flexible even in the face of evolving challenges.  We are committed to providing TSA\u2019s employees with competitive compensation and benefits.  That goal should be accomplished, however, through the budget, rather than through a statutory reclassification of TSA\u2019s workforce.  That is why the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2021 Budget proposes annual pay increases for Transportation Security Officers (TSOs).  The President\u2019s budget proposal allows for predictable pay progression and provides funding for merit-based pay increases for high-performing TSOs.  It optimizes existing authorities and properly resources ongoing workforce initiatives.  As such, the President\u2019s budget better meets the needs of TSA, its workforce, and taxpayers than H.R. 1140. If H.R. 1140 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration commends the bipartisan work undertaken to develop H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency Act of 2019.  This legislation would require corporations and limited liability companies in the United States to disclose their beneficial owners, a measure that will help prevent malign actors from leveraging anonymity to exploit these entities for criminal gain.  It would also assist law enforcement in detecting and preventing illicit activity such as terrorist financing and money laundering.  Additionally, this bill would substantially update the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) for the first time since 2001.  These reforms will modernize financial institutions\u2019 compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, counter the financing of terrorism requirements, and close loopholes in existing law.  For these reasons, the Administration believes this legislation represents important progress in strengthening national security, supporting law enforcement, and clarifying regulatory requirements.  Nevertheless, certain steps must be taken to improve H.R. 2513 as it moves through the legislative process.  These include aligning the definition of \u201cbeneficial owner\u201d to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\u2019s Customer Due Diligence Final Rule, protecting small businesses from unduly burdensome disclosure requirements, and providing for adequate access controls with respect to the information gathered under this bill\u2019s new disclosure regime.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to engage in a bipartisan fashion with the House and Senate to address these important issues.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J.Res. 26, a joint resolution disapproving arms sales to the Government of Qatar. This joint resolution relates to $3 billion in Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Qatar for twenty-four AH-64E Apache Attack helicopters.  This package is intended for the sovereign defense of Qatar, which is host to United States Central Command forces and serves as a critical forward-deployed location in the region.  In addition to the military personnel in Qatar, more than 15,000 United States citizens live on the Qatar Peninsula.  The FMS case at issue supports the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important partner for political and economic progress in the Middle East.  This FMS transaction will enhance long-term defensive and offensive capabilities on the Qatar Peninsula, as well as the protection of key oil and gas infrastructure and platforms.  By supporting thousands of American jobs, this FMS transaction also helps to strengthen the United States defense industrial base and promotes economic security. In addition to negatively affecting our bilateral relationship with Qatar, the joint resolution would significantly hinder interoperability between our nations.  Qatar serves as a bulwark against Iran and its nefarious activities throughout the region, and it partners with the United States to counter al-Qa\u2019ida and ISIS.   If S.J. Res. 26 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he veto it. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of  H.R. 2456, which would repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107\u2013243)  (\u201c2002 AUMF\u201d).  The United States  forces that have been threatened by  Iranian and  Iran-backed  attacks  in  Iraq  are there to combat terrorist  groups such as ISIS.  H.R. 2456 would undermine their ability to execute this mission, and the President\u2019s ability to defend United States  forces and  interests in the region against ongoing threats from Iran and Iranian-sponsored proxies.  It would also terminate a critical legal authority that three successive  administrations have relied upon to use force against threats to our national security, and that of our international partners.  The 2002 AUMF provides specific statutory authorization to engage in military action to \u201cdefend the national security of  the United States against the  continuing threat posed by  Iraq.\u201d  The 2002 AUMF has  long been understood to authorize the use of force for, among other purposes, addressing threats  emanating from  Iraq, including threats such  as ISIS\u2014a group whose objectives have included  establishing an  Islamic state in Iraq and using that state to support terrorism against the United States\u2014as well as  threats  directed  by  Iran.  Through its Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force, Iran conducts and directs the  actions  of several terrorist  groups in Iraq, such  as Kata\u2019ib Hizballah.  Iran and  Iran-sponsored proxies continue to plan and execute attacks  against  United States forces in Iraq and terrorize religious minority groups and peaceful protestors throughout that country.  With respect to  Iran\u2019s malign  activities  in  Iraq, the  2002 AUMF provides critical authorities for the United States to defend itself and its partner forces  as they carry out their missions against terrorist threats emanating from  Iraq and in support of a stable, democratic Iraq.   The arbitrary termination of  the authorization  would embolden our enemies with the recognizable goal of outlasting us.  This  bill is misguided, and its adoption by Congress would undermine the ability of the United States to protect American  citizens whom  Iran continues to seek to harm.  It would  make the world less safe, less secure,  and less free. If H.R. 2456 were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend he veto it.  ** * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res 7,  a joint resolution that purports to direct the President to remove United States forces  from hostilities in or  affecting the Republic of  Yemen, with certain exceptions.   The premise of the joint resolution is flawed. Since 2015, the United States has provided limited support to member countries of the Saudi-led  coalition, including intelligence sharing, logistics  support, and, until recently, aerial refueling, to  assist in the defense of United States  allies and partners. The provision of this support has not caused United States  forces  to be introduced into hostilities.  Such support is provided pursuant to licenses and approvals under the Arms Export Control Act, statutory authorities for Department  of Defense to provide logistics support to foreign countries, and the President\u2019s constitutional powers. Because the President has directed  United States forces to support the Saudi-led coalition under his constitutional powers, the joint resolution would raise serious constitutional concerns to the extent it seeks to override the President\u2019s determination as Commander in Chief. In addition to its erroneous premise, the joint resolution would harm bilateral relationships in the  region, negatively  affect  our ability to prevent the spread of violent extremist organizations\u2014 such as al-Qa\u2019ida in the  Arabian Peninsula and  ISIS in Yemen\u2014and establish bad  precedent  for  future legislation  by  defining \u201chostilities\u201d to include defense cooperation such as aerial refueling  for purposes of this legislation. While we appreciate that  sections  5 and 6 of the resolution acknowledge these serious consequences to some extent, after-the-fact reporting is not an effective means to mitigate  them. Our continued cooperation with regional partner nations allows  the United States to support diplomatic negotiations to end the conflict, promote humanitarian access,  mitigate civilian  casualties,  enhance efforts to recover  United States hostages in Yemen, and defeat terrorists  who  seek to harm the United  States.  If  S.J. Res. 7  were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the  joint resolution.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1644.  This legislation would nullify the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rule on \u201cRestoring Internet Freedom,\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. 7852 (February 22, 2018).  Last year, the FCC returned to the light-touch regulatory scheme that enabled the internet to develop and thrive for nearly two decades by promoting internet freedom and encouraging network investment.  Since the new rule was adopted in 2018, consumers have benefited from a greater than 35 percent increase in average, fixed broadband download speeds, and the United States rose to sixth, from thirteenth, in the world for those speeds.  In 2018, fiber was also made available to more new homes than in any previous year, and capital investment by the Nation\u2019s top six Internet service providers increased by $2.3 billion.   H.R. 1644 would undermine this success by repealing the FCC\u2019s current rule to: (1) restore the classification of broadband as an information service and end the public-utility-style regulation of the internet; and (2) promote transparency by requiring broadband providers to disclose their network management practices and commercial terms, including any blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, or affiliate prioritization.  H.R. 1644 would instead return to the heavy-handed regulatory approach of the previous administration and undo the FCC\u2019s action that restored the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s authority to investigate and take enforcement action against unfair, deceptive, or anti-competitive acts or practices committed by broadband providers.  H.R. 1644 would also prevent the Commission from adopting rules similar to the current regulations, tying the hands of the Commission in the future and preventing the agency from evolving its rules to adapt to emerging technologies.  If H.R. 1644 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. * * * * * * * ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 823, the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act.  This bill would impose land restrictions on nearly 400,000 acres of land in Colorado, and would reduce areas open for motorized recreation.  The Administration has pledged to expand access to America\u2019s public lands, increase hunting, fishing, and recreational opportunities nationwide, and enhance conservation stewardship.  H.R. 823, however, would not achieve these goals in a balanced way, and the Administration opposes it as currently drafted.  The Administration is committed to managing public lands as a good neighbor to the local communities and to the Americans who live and work in close proximity to them.  Engaging local stakeholders and considering their on-the-ground expertise are critical steps in making decisions about public lands management.  Rural communities have raised concerns that the land-use restrictions included in H.R. 823 would have negative effects on local economies, and, as evidenced by the committee process, it appears that local sentiment has not been adequately taken into account when developing this bill.  The Administration, therefore, opposes H.R. 823 in its current form, but it is willing to work with the Congress to improve it if the bill is considered further.  If H.R. 823 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. * * * * * * * ", "The Administration supports efforts to strengthen consumer credit reporting, but it opposes H.R. 5332.  This bill  would expand the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s  (CFPB)  already broad authority over credit reporting agencies and create an unnecessary position of a credit reporting ombudsperson  within the CFPB.  Additionally, H.R. 5332 would require large consumer credit  reporting agencies to create an online consumer portal on which all  advertising, marketing, and solicitation would be banned.  This  ban on commercial speech appears to lack a  sufficiently  compelling justification,  which the Constitution requires.   The Administration has worked in a bipartisan manner to improve the consumer credit reporting system.  In May 2018, President Trump signed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 115-174), which included an important  amendment to the Fair Credit  Reporting Act and helped lead to a historically strong economy with low unemployment and rising wages.  These and other measures have proven successful, and the  Administration stands ready to work in a bipartisan manner to take similar actions that are in line with its core principles, as outlined in Executive Order 13772,  for regulation and do not unnecessarily expand the size of government.

This bill attempts to exploit the coronavirus pandemic to resuscitate tired, partisan proposals that would send hundreds of billions of dollars to insurance companies in order to paper over serious flaws in Obamacare.  Furthermore, H.R. 1425 would pay for this bailout by imposing price controls that undermine the American innovation the entire globe is depending on to deliver the vaccines and therapeutics needed to respond to the coronavirus. Since the beginning of this crisis, the Administration has taken a whole-of-America approach to fight the coronavirus.  This includes a productive partnership with both houses of Congress to respond to the healthcare needs of our citizens.  The Administration has delivered millions of pieces of personal protective equipment to frontline healthcare responders, surged hospital capacity, and dramatically scaled up diagnostic and surveillance testing capabilities.  The Administration also launched Operation Warp Speed to collaborate with the private sector to develop a coronavirus vaccine, therapeutics, and diagnostics.  Additionally, the Administration is working to reimburse providers for coronavirus testing and treatment of uninsured Americans so they do not have to worry about the financial implications of obtaining these services.  All this was done while putting the country in the strongest possible position to rebound from the most significant economic challenge since the Great Depression.  Working with Congress, the Administration has delivered financial relief directly to over 160 million Americans, over 4.5 million businesses and their employees, and over one million healthcare providers. Instead of building on these vital, bipartisan efforts, H.R. 1425 reads as if the coronavirus never emerged.  It repurposes failed proposals from years past that would literally pay insurance companies more to hide the true cost of Obamacare from consumers.  Even the additional billions of taxpayer funding is not enough to prop up Obamacare on its own, thus H.R. 1425 goes out of its way to systematically eliminate any competition by prohibiting more affordable coverage options and the consideration of alternative approaches by States.  At the same time, the bill lacks any provision to ensure the Federal Government adheres to the long-held consensus to not fund abortion services or abortion coverage. To create a fa\u00e7ade of \u201cpaying\u201d for the revival of last decade\u2019s most partisan project, Obamacare, H.R. 1425 invokes another partisan misadventure reflected in provisions of H.R. 3.  In its Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 3, the Administration explained that these provisions  would impose price controls under the guise of \u201cnegotiation\u201d that would ultimately \u201charm  seniors and all who need lifesaving medicines.\u201d  In perhaps an indication of the intentions of H.R. 1425, it does not even attempt to include those provisions of H.R. 3 that had previously garnered bipartisan support, such as establishing a cap on out-of-pocket expenses for all beneficiaries in Medicare Part D and other improvements to that program for seniors.  While any time is an inopportune time to dramatically undermine the development of innovative medicines, H.R. 1425 is even more imprudent given the current focus on developing vaccines and therapeutics rapidly to help America and the world combat the coronavirus.  To take such an action simply to double down on the same expensive, inefficient, and bureaucratic approach to health coverage that the American people endured for the past decade makes it even more misguided and counter to the most urgent needs of the country.  If H.R. 1425 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports enactment of a National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for a 60th  consecutive year. It is also grateful for  the strong, bipartisan work this year by the House Armed Services Committee (Committee) on behalf of America\u2019s national defense. The Administration applauds the Committee\u2019s bipartisan support for a national defense discretionary topline of $740.5  billion, which is  consistent with the President\u2019s Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Budget Request  and the Bipartisan Budget  Act of 2019,  and for the  Committee\u2019s  full support of the President\u2019s Active Duty Forces end-strength request. Such consistent funding and end-strength numbers will further enable irreversible  implementation of the National Defense Strategy\u2019s  (NDS)  key lines of effort:  (1) Sustaining and building readiness to deter, fight, and win; (2) Strengthening alliances, deepening interoperability, and attracting  new partners; (3) Reforming the Department of Defense (DOD) for greater performance and accountability; and (4) Supporting the backbone of America\u2019s national security \u2013  our service members, military families, and DOD  civilians. Nevertheless, H.R. 6395 includes several provisions that present serious concerns. Among other major provisions, the Administration strongly objects to section 2829, which would require renaming of certain military institutions. It also has serious concerns about provisions of the bill that seek to micromanage aspects of the executive branch\u2019s authority, impose highly prescriptive limitations on the use of funds for Afghanistan, and otherwise constrain the President\u2019s authority to protect national security interests. Many of these provisions would pose significant challenges to continued execution of the NDS.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress  to address its significant concerns with  these aspects of the bill,  the most significant of which are discussed  below. The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the classified annex to the committee report and working with Congress to address any concerns about classified programs.  If H.R. 6395 were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto it.  1 Renaming Certain Military Installations and Other Defense Property (Section 2829). The Administration strongly objects to section  2829  of the bill, which  would require  renaming of any military installation or defense property named after any person who served in the political or military leadership of any armed rebellion against the United States. Over the years, these locations have taken on significance to the American story and those  who have helped write it  that far transcends their namesakes. The Administration respects the legacy of the millions of American servicemen and women who have served with honor at these military bases, and who from these locations have fought and died in two World Wars, Vietnam, the War on Terror, and other conflicts. Further, the drive to rename will not stop at the limits written into section 2829. Section 2829  is part of a sustained effort to erase from the history of the Nation those  who do not meet an  ever-shifting standard of conduct. Beyond section 2829, loud voices in America are also demanding the  destruction or renaming of monuments and memorials to former Presidents, including the our first President, George Washington;  the author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson;  and the Great Emancipator, Abraham Lincoln.  President Trump has been clear in his opposition to politically motivated attempts like this to rewrite history and to displace the enduring legacy of the American Revolution with a new left-wing cultural  revolution.   Modification and Clarification of Construction Authority in the Event of a Declaration of  War or National Emergency (Section 2801).  The Administration strongly objects to section 2801 because it would significantly curtail the authority of DOD under 10 U.S.C. 2808 by imposing spending caps, limiting the source of funds, constraining the Secretary of Defense\u2019s ability to waive laws that impede expeditious response to an emergency, and imposing burdensome congressional reporting requirements. Section 2808 was originally enacted to allow for the adjustment of military construction priorities in the event of a declaration of war or national emergency, and this section would greatly restrict that ability. These arbitrary limits increase risks to the Armed Forces and the national security of the United States.  Requirement of Consent of the Chief Executive Officer for Certain Full-time National Guard Duty Performed in a State, Territory, or the District of Columbia (Section 513). The Administration strongly objects to section 513, which would grant the Mayor of the District of Columbia the authority to deny the President the use of the District of Columbia National Guard under  the authority of  32 U.S.C. 502(f)(2)(A). This provision would alter how the District of Columbia National Guard is administered and employed under current statute and Executive Orders. Currently, the Mayor of the District of Columbia has no authority over the District of  Columbia National Guard. This provision would  grant the Mayor authority over certain uses of the District of Columbia National Guard. This is particularly problematic in circumstances when it becomes necessary for the President, the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of the  Army to use the District of Columbia National Guard under  the authority of section  502(f)(2)(A) to support Federal  law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia or to defend the seat of the United States Government.  Force Reduction in Afghanistan Limitations (Section 1213). The Administration strongly objects to section 1213\u2019s highly prescriptive limitations on the use of funds for Afghanistan and its measures to reduce  forces  in  Afghanistan, until the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the 2 Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Commander of U.S. Central Command, the Commander of U.S. Forces\u2014Afghanistan, and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations,  submits a report certifying that they will not harm counterterror operations, risk United States  personnel, or  increase risk of expanding terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan. It would also contravene the President\u2019s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. This provision would restrict  the President from discharging his  Constitutional  authority to reduce forces levels in Afghanistan if he deems it necessary. It also would subordinate the President\u2019s authority to the  discretion of the officials whose concurrence would be required for the certification. Further, by requiring the concurrence of three military officers  for the certification, the provision also would  subordinate the Secretary of Defense\u2019s discretion to the judgment of those military subordinates, upending the military chain of command and the principle of civilian control of the military.    Force Reduction in Germany Limitations (Section 1241).  The Administration affirms the  inherent need for a ready presence in the European theater, but it  strongly objects to section 1241. This section  would prohibit the closure of any base  or facility under the European Consolidation Initiative until  the Secretary of Defense can certify that there is no longer a need for a rotational military  presence in the European theater. The constraint on reducing the numbers of active duty service members would also contravene the President\u2019s authority as Commander in Chief.   United States participation in the Open Skies Treaty (Section 1234).  The Administration is deeply concerned by the highly prescriptive text  mandating joint notification by the Secretaries  of Defense and State on the conclusion of agreements to secure notifications of observational overflights from countries  that host  United States  military forces, and reports on such agreements  and where the United State  did not secure them. The provision also requires the sharing of imagery and reporting on diplomatic exchanges that are within the prerogative of the executive branch  to protect.  Indo-Pacific Reassurance Initiative  (IPRI)  (Section 1251).  The Administration supports the Committee\u2019s intent to emphasize our deep commitment to defending our interests and those of our allies in the Indo-Pacific region. The Administration looks forward to working with the Committee on IPRI to prioritize our investments,  maintain a  credible deterrent, and demonstrate an enduring, whole-of-government commitment to the region, but does have some concerns that this provision may limit  DOD\u2019s  flexibility to adjust to an evolving regional security environment, and looks  forward to further discussions with Congress  on these matters.  Diversity  and Inclusion  (Section  912).  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for DOD\u2019s  strong commitment to advancing equal opportunity, diversity, and inclusion throughout our Armed Forces. In light of the initiatives already being implemented  at Secretary Esper\u2019s direction, the Administration strongly objects to section  912, which would create four new presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed (PAS) officials who would compete  directly  with the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness and the Assistant Secretaries  of the Military Departments for Manpower and Reserve Affairs. This bifurcation of  responsibility would add unnecessary bureaucracy and internal competition into this critical area at a time when a focused effort is needed, and is already underway at the highest  levels of DOD  and the U.S. Coast Guard.  3  Limitations on Use of Funds in the National Defense Sealift Fund  (Section 1022).  The Administration objects to section 1022. While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support to procure additional used vessels for the sealift mission, the Administration urges  removal of  the requirement to procure new construction sealift vessels. This will allow the Administration to begin the necessary step of recapitalizing the sealift fleet for a fraction of the cost of procuring new vessels.   Coordination in Transfer of Funds by DOD  to National Nuclear Security Administration (Section 1641).  The Administration objects to section 1641, which attempts to micromanage the executive branch\u2019s budget formulation for the Department of Energy\u2019s  (DOE)  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). The Secretary of Defense does not transfer \u201cnuclear budget request  authority\u201d to the NNSA. The President is  responsible for  managing  the executive branch budget formulation process and determines requested levels for  resources among competing priorities and departments.   Advanced Naval Nuclear Fuel System  Based on Low-Enriched Uranium (Section 3116).  The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s direction to establish a program to assess  the viability of using low-enriched uranium in naval nuclear reactors. In 2018, the Secretary  of Energy and the  Secretary of the Navy jointly determined that the United States should not  pursue such research  and development  because  such a system  would be  far less capable  and  more expensive  than current reactor designs.   Formally Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program  (Section 3103).  The Administration objects to section 3103 because it would reduce DOE funding for the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program  (FUSRAP), thereby rejecting the Budget proposal to transition administration of  the program. The Administration urges the House  to move the  FUSRAP  from the Department of the Army  to DOE. Transferring responsibility of this program to DOE will facilitate more efficient cleanup of these contaminated sites  by the Army Corps of Engineers, allow DOE to consider  the full range of cleanup responsibilities in prioritizing work, reduce the costs of  activities now undertaken by both agencies, and simplify the process for transferring these sites  back to DOE for long-term surveillance and maintenance.   Information and Intelligence Exclusions  (Sections  1631-1632 and 1712).  The Administration supports  the intent of sections  1631, 1632, and 1712. These sections, however, do not  adequately reflect the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s statutory responsibility to protect intelligence sources and methods with regard to cybersecurity threat intelligence related to information systems operated by agencies within the Intelligence Community. With respect  to section 1631, the Administration supports appropriate collaboration on cyber threat  information within the United States  Government. The Administration, however,  strongly objects to the lack of an opt-out provision reasonably tailored to address sources and methods information sharing related to such systems. With respect to section 1632, the Administration expects to use  the rulemaking authority in subsection (e)  to address similar concerns. Finally, the Administration strongly objects to  section 1712, which  would  lead to the potential disclosure in public reports of classified information and information relating to intelligence sources  and methods. It should be noted, however, that the  National Archives and Records Administration has already done much of what is contemplated in section 1712 under its existing authorities. In order to protect   4  intelligence sources and methods related to such systems, the Administration looks forward to working with Congress to craft appropriate exclusions.   Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space and Strategic  Deterrence Policy  (Section 921). The Administration is grateful for the continued partnership with Congress in standing up the Space Force as our Nation\u2019s newest military branch. The Administration, however, strongly objects to adding nuclear deterrence and missile defense responsibilities to the responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy. The Administration is finishing the statutorily required study directed in the FY  2020 NDAA and looks forward to working with Congress on the most efficient and impactful roles and responsibilities of the new office.   Military Construction Infrastructure and Weapon System Synchronization for Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (Section 2404).  The Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s  general approach in section 2404 to provide some of the flexibility requested by the Administration for Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent launch facility and launch center conversion activities.  In order to keep these critical projects on time and on budget,  however,  the Administration requests that Congress provide the authority to use RDT&E and Missile Procurement funding to carry out the construction and conversion projects.    Limitations on Divestiture and Retirement (Sections 122-125, 1045, and 1047).  The Administration strongly objects to language in sections 122 (RC-135), 123 (E-8), 124 (RQ-4), 125 (KC-135, KC-10), 1045 (EQ-4), and 1047 (A-10) that limits DOD\u2019s ability to divest or retire specific platforms. The President\u2019s  Budget divests or  retires platforms to reinvest in leading-edge  innovation, ensuring dominance across all domains: air, land, sea, space and cyber. Limiting DOD\u2019s flexibility to prioritize resource investment delays modernization of capabilities, preparation for great power competition, and implementation of the NDS.   Bombers (Section 129).  The Administration strongly objects to this provision because it would constrain DOD\u2019s  flexibility to adjust its weapons system inventory to meet  NDS imperatives, and inhibit its ability to manage its resources  effectively. The Air Force  is focused on prototyping new war-winning capabilities to enhance capacity of fires such as palletized munitions, which could offer enhanced capacity of fires without increasing demand for additional  aircraft platforms that are more expensive.   Enhanced Domestic Content Requirement for Major Defense Acquisition Programs  (Section 825).  The Administration strongly objects to section 825 requiring Major  Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAPs) to be 100 percent manufactured domestically by the arbitrary deadline of October 1, 2026. The proposal would have a significant and detrimental effect in weakening the integrity of our contracting process, driving  increases to acquisition lead times, adding  to project  costs, and impacting  delivery of critical MDAP capabilities to the warfighter.     Documentation Relating to the F-35 Aircraft Program (Section 131).  The Administration strongly objects to section 131, which would limit the ability of the Secretary of Defense to grant  Milestone C approval for the F-35 program or enter into full-rate production until 30 days after the Secretary has submitted extensive congressional reporting requirements that go well beyond  the requirements  of 10  U.S.C. 2366c for a Milestone C decision. The reporting requirements are  5  overly burdensome and,  in some cases,  would be extremely difficult, if not impossible,  to answer. The requirements  would therefore cause significant delay in achieving a full-rate production decision and providing critical warfighting capability.   Reprioritization of Military Construction Funding to Unrequested Projects  (Section 4601).  The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s realignment of military  construction funding from  priority projects to other projects not included  in  the FY 2021 President\u2019s Budget Request. Contrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible policy to fully fund projects, the bill proposes to fund 12 military construction projects  incrementally, effectively creating an unfunded obligation of $600 million needed to fully fund these projects over time. The bill diverts these funds to other unrequested projects.   Pilot Program on Prosecution of Special Victim Offenses Committed by Attendees of  Military Service Academies (Section 549A). The Administration strongly objects to this provision because it outsources authority for discipline, as well as undermines commander  accountability and the chain of command relationship. This provision is inconsistent with many provisions in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, necessitating major  revision of the Rules for Courts-Martial, which is not practicable by the provision\u2019s effective date. The likely consequence is that there would be no operable military justice system for sexual assault cases  and other covered cases arising from the military service academies  for some period of time. Additionally, section 540F of the FY 2020 NDAA called for a study and report  to assess the feasibility of such a pilot  program, which is due by  October 15, 2020. Legislation directing this pilot program before the study and report  is completed is premature.     Authority of Military Judges and Military Magistrates to Issue Military Court Protective Orders (Section 542). The Administration strongly supports providing necessary protections to victims but strongly  objects to section 542 because it would strain the military justice system\u2019s limited resources and greatly expand  the authority of military judges into an area reserved to civil courts. This provision is unnecessary because commanding officers have authority to issue military protective orders and service members, dependents, and non-DOD affiliated civilian victims in the United States have  access to State civil courts, which have established infrastructure to receive, consider, and adjudicate  protection order petitions, unlike military courts. If enacted, this provision would likely result in a significant expansion of the military  justice system\u2019s caseload, for which the system does not have adequate personnel,  thereby producing undesirable systemic delays, including in sexual assault  cases. Finally, this provision would, in practice, represent a major expansion of the portion of the Gun Control Act of 1968 codified at 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(8).      Basic Needs Allowance for Low-Income Regular Members (Section 602).  The Administration strongly objects to providing  a basic needs allowance to low-income members because DOD already provides for the complete food and housing needs  of members.  Military members are well-compensated, and  more junior enlisted members are  paid between the 95th and 99th percentiles relative to their private-sector peers. In addition, the housing allowance, a significant part of a member\u2019s compensation, is excluded from the basic  needs allowance eligibility calculation. Instead, the basic needs allowance is based on a member\u2019s household size and would require roommates and unrelated individuals in the household to disclose  their   6  detailed, personal income information to DOD  to calculate  the member\u2019s  allowance. This section would also raise fairness concerns by  excluding  members of the United States Coast  Guard, members assigned outside the United States, and  members of the Active Guard and Reserve.   Notice and Comment for Proposed Actions of the Secretary of Defense Relation to Food and Beverage Ingredients (Section 1753).  The Administration strongly objects to the requirement to publish a Federal Register notice and provide opportunity for public comment before  limiting or prohibiting any food or beverage ingredient  in military food service, military  medical foods, or commissary foods. This law would jeopardize the safety of  service  members, as it would dangerously delay by months a DOD-wide recall or prohibition of certain ingredients that have been determined by the Food and Drug Administration, the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service, the Surgeons General of the DOD, or other regulatory  or public health  authority to be harmful for human consumption.     Modification to Limitation on  the Realignment or Reduction of Military Medical Manning End Strength (Section 715). The Administration strongly objects to any prohibition related to realignment or reduction of military  medical end strength until the Secretary of Defense submits a report to Congress on whether specific conditions and analyses have been completed. Prohibiting DOD from converting medical end strength to higher priority needs for a year  prevents DOD from appropriately shaping the force in a planned, timely way to meet NDS requirements.      Mandatory Criteria for Strategic Basing Decisions (Section 1048). The Administration strongly objects to section 1048 because isolating a limited set of basing factors, reporting pre-decisional basing information, and providing publicly releasable quantitative analysis on community support will embolden special interest groups to influence Air Force decisions and circumvent proper application of military judgment to make strategic basing decisions to best  support the NDS.   Limitation on Reserve Components of the Air Force (Section 517). The Administration strongly objects to section 517 because it would restrict routine personnel reassignments within  the Air Force Reserve  and Air National Guard as well as strategic basing actions until  certain conditions are met. Ultimately, section 517  restricts the ability of the Secretary of the Air Force  to manage and posture forces to support the NDS.   Support Provided to Other United States Agencies for Counterdrug Activities and Activities  to Counter Transnational Organized Crime (Section 1012). The Administration objects to the language in  section 1012 requiring congressional notification 15 days before  providing counterdrug and counter transnational organized crime support to United States  law enforcement agencies under 10 U.S.C. 284(b) authority. This requirement would effectively terminate the authority delegated to Combatant Commanders to provide short-notice support to United States  law enforcement agencies, including the fulfillment of short-notice  intelligence analysis requests and transportation requests,  such as the fulfillment of ad hoc translation or intelligence analysis requests and short-notice transportation requests for law enforcement agency personnel, contraband, or for controlled deliveries.     7  Nonimmigrant Status for Certain Nationals of Portugal (Section 1755).  The Administration objects to the provision that certain nationals of Portugal, for purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of  section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 11101(a)(15)(E)), shall be considered eligible to apply for E treaty trader nonimmigrant visas if the Government of Portugal provides similar nonimmigrant status to nationals of the United States. A separate bill, H.R.  565,  was passed by the House  and sent to the Senate in December 2019. Adding this provision to the NDAA would  subvert the usual process for addressing E treaty trader nonimmigrant visa status. The Administration looks forward to Congress continuing its work on H.R. 565 and coming to a final resolution on this issue.   Limitation on Authority to Exclude Employees from Chapter 71 of Title 5 (Section 1102). The Administration objects to section 1102 because it would constrain the President\u2019s authority to protect national security interests through a critical workforce management tool. This authority has allowed Presidents to respond  quickly  to emerging threats and national emergencies  since 1978,  and this prohibition is unwarranted.   Limiting the Number of Local Wage Areas Defined Within a Pay Locality (Section 1106). The Administration strongly objects to section 1106 because it would unnecessarily increase the  costs for Federal agencies to conduct business in certain parts of the country by forcing agencies to pay their  employees well above market wage levels. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM),  with the advice of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee, the national labor-management committee responsible for advising OPM on the administration of  the Federal Wage System, is in the best position to administer the prevailing rate system in accordance with existing laws and administrative procedures,  which fully consider  the views of  affected agencies, employees, and the public.   Modification of Requirements Relating to Certain Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (Section 213).  The  Administration strongly objects to section 213,  which introduces new and undefined terms and concepts  that  obscure congressional intent,  and, in some cases, are detrimental to the DOD\u2019s ability to cooperate with allies and partners in accordance with the NDS. It also adds layers to authorities already possessed under 10 U.S.C. 2350a and 22 U.S.C.  section 2767. The existing authorities under 10 U.S.C. 2350a are long-standing and have  proven to be fully sufficient and broad at this time, in conjunction with other existing authorities, to enable a wide array of cooperative research and development agreements with DOD partners globally.     Pilot Program to Support Combatant Command Military Construction Priorities (Section 2807).  Although the Administration supports the Committee\u2019s intent to expedite the posture  priorities in the Indo-Pacific Command, it objects  to  section 2807, which would establish a pilot program to reserve 10  percent of all appropriated military construction funds for execution by the Combatant Command. The Administration has placed a significant focus on ensuring that  the necessary capabilities are achieved in the United States  Indo-Pacific region,  and a separate reserve would divert funding from other priority military construction projects  that are also required for critical global capabilities.    8  Homeland Defense Radar\u2014Hawaii (HDR-H)  (Section 4201).  The Administration strongly disagrees with the authorization of funding for the Homeland Defense Radar  \u2013  Hawaii. The Administration\u2019s highest missile defense priority is to increase the size and reliability of its interceptor fleet as soon as possible. To provide a  more robust defense of the continental United States  and Hawaii, the Department is prioritizing the Next Generation Interceptor and underlay demonstrations.    Modifications to Supervision and Award of Certain Contracts (Section 841). The Administration strongly objects to section 841 because the provision will  increase acquisition time, add to project costs, affect  construction quality, and duplicate existing reporting and advertising requirements  to well-known SBA and Federal systems. It would insert the government in prime contractors\u2019 subcontracting arrangements by promoting government-directed subcontractor  arrangements. It  also would limit technical capability at  the subcontractor  level by creating a regional preference for firms,  potentially affecting  contractor performance by excluding more experienced firms, and could exclude competitive and cost-effective small  businesses outside those  parameters, extend contract lead times, and increase project costs.   Standardization of Payment of  Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay for Members of  the Armed  Forces (Section 613).  The Administration objects to section 613 because it restricts the ability to prorate payments of all forms of hazardous duty pay.  Requiring the payment without proration would be a notable departure from the norm and equity of other incentive pay authorities in which the payment amounts reflect the duration of actual qualifying service.  Without proration, a member who performs a hazardous duty for only part of a month would receive a \u201cwindfall,\u201d  and this devalues the payment for a member who must perform  the hazardous duty for an entire month.  This provision, with its narrow scope and restrictive provisions, removes the Secretary\u2019s discretion and flexibility concerning the payment method for hazardous  duty pay.    Chair of  DOD  Explosive Safety Board (Section 361). The Administration strongly objects to section 361, which would adversely impact DOD\u2019s performance of its Acquisition and Sustainment mission by limiting its ability to execute or obligate more than 75 percent of FY 2021 funds. This funding is limited until the services and OSD appoint military officers to the Explosives Safety Board and its Chair, which eliminates DOD\u2019s ability to appoint  the most qualified explosives safety professionals, many of whom  are civilians.     Analysis of  Alternatives for Homeland Missile Defense Missions (Section 1656). The Administration strongly objects to section 1656, which would  direct an Analysis of Alternatives  for Homeland Missile Defense. In 2016, Missile Defense Agency  (MDA) analysis showed that  regional missile defense systems have the potential to provide ballistic missile defense for strategic attacks against the homeland.    Responsibility for  the Sector Risk  Management Agency Function of  DOD  (Section 1624).  The Administration strongly objects to this provision\u2019s assignment of responsibilities for the Defense Industrial Base  within DOD. This direction would contradict existing policies, blur  statutory authorities, and necessitate a significant recalibration of existing efforts. Further, it would impose substantial unbudgeted costs in an austere fiscal environment,  delay initiatives to  9  secure the Defense Industrial Base,  and limit the management authority and flexibility of the Secretary of Defense.   Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy (Section 902). The Administration strongly objects to section 902. The provision would constrain the Secretary of Defense\u2019s discretionary authority to use Assistant Secretary of Defense positions for his highest priorities. Further,  this provision would create a  legal inconsistency by creating an  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy  with  authority over export control issues, when current law  vests that authority with  the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.   Modifications to Implementation Plan for Restructure or Realignment of Military Medical Treatment Facilities (Section 716). The Administration strongly objects to the addition of a year-long waiting period  before  executing  the changes to the military medical treatment facilities required by Congress in the FY 2017 NDAA. A year-long delay will complicate the ability for local providers to plan for additional staff and any increase in facilities necessary to care for additional DOD  beneficiaries. This will make implementation more difficult to coordinate and is counterproductive to achieving Congress\u2019s  original goals expressed in legislation.   Limitation  on the Physical Move, Integration, Reassignment, or Shift in Responsibility of Marine Forces Northern Command (Section 1050). This provision unduly restricts the Commandant\u2019s ability to manage his service by placing artificial barriers to realignment of commands that are intended to provide the following: (1) Better posturing of Marine Corps organizations to provide support to Combatant Commanders, in this case of Northern Command, by co-locating the service component (Marine Forces North) with the force provider (Marine Forces Command); and (2) Aligning  the Marine Corps structure to that of the Navy, an objective outlined in the Commandant\u2019s Planning Guidance, by locating Marine Forces North and Marine Forces Command geographically with Fleet Forces Command and Naval  Forces North.   Extension of Limitation Relating to Classification of High-Level Waste (Section 3113).  The Administration strongly objects to section 3113, which impairs DOE\u2019s  ability to manage the lifecycle of radioactive waste  under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA). This impairment could limit  DOE\u2019s ability to advance its cleanup mission,  including the cleanup of reprocessing waste, and potentially could increase the costs to complete such efforts,  which is  in conflict with DOE fulfilling its mission in a cost-effective manner. This provision could  also cause potential legal conflicts concerning State authority when read alongside AEA provisions that unambiguously grant exclusive authority to the Federal Government to store, process, transport, and dispose of radioactive waste resulting from weapons production.   Nuclear Warhead Acquisition Processes (Section 3111).  The Administration objects to section 3111, which would impose overly prescriptive and duplicative requirements on the  DOE/NNSA  and DOD\u2019s  joint nuclear  weapons acquisition processes.  The requirements set forth in  section 3111 are unnecessary because  there  are well-established processes for nuclear weapons  acquisition.  The existing Phase X processes and procedures include control points, approvals, independent cost reviews, peer reviews, and reporting requirements.  Section 3111 would add delays and  costs  with little benefit.     10  Plutonium Pit Production (Section 3115).  The Administration objects to  section 3115, which adds unnecessary requirements for an independent cost estimate that  assigns  a \u201cconfidence level.\u201d  DOE Order 413.3B  processes for managing capital asset acquisition already include the development of independent cost estimates at each critical decision milestone,  including confidence levels based on project scale, complexity and scope reasonable at the expected milestone, as well as independent cost estimates when appropriate.   Small Business Contracting and Category Management (Section  833).  The Administration is  proud of the record-setting level of contract awards that have been made to small business  contractors, and the ability to do so in harmony with the use of category management principles that are helping agencies achieve greater value for the taxpayer and save tens of billions of dollars.  The  Administration, however,  objects to constraints in section 833 that could complicate how best to balance the participation of section  8(a)  contractors, women-owned small  businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and HUBZone contractors on local, agency-wide, and government-wide contracts.  The Administration recognizes the critical need to minimize barriers to entry.  The Frictionless Acquisition Cross Agency Priority Goal reflects our commitment to ensure  that category management practices are used to reduce barriers  to entry and increase the level of opportunity available to small business and strengthen small business  resiliency in the Federal marketplace.    Foreign Policy and Assistance Related Matters (Sections 1213, 1258-1259, and 1266).  Sections 1213, 1258, 1259, and 1266, among other provisions, concern  foreign policy and foreign assistance priorities, and while they may advance efforts that the Administration supports, the Administration is concerned that these provisions do not have a means to ensure the  implementation of these authorities are consistent with United States foreign policy interests and to avoid serious unintended consequences.   Clarifications regarding scope of employment and reemployment rights of members of the uniformed services (Section  534). The Administration objects to  the arbitration provision of section 534.  Barring military service discrimination claims from being sent to arbitration in accordance with existing agreements would circumvent established contracts and add unnecessary legal procedures.  This would not clarify or reinforce the rights of members of the uniformed services. Instead,  it would fundamentally alter the process of dispute resolution to an unknown end.     Amendment to definition of qualified apprentice (Section  817).  The Administration objects to section 817 because it would attempt to undercut Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs and other private sector-led workforce training models, which support workers in developing skills and finding jobs.  Undermining high-quality  and successful apprenticeship programs that have been developed by industry is a move in the wrong direction.   Special  Rules for Certain Monthly Workers\u2019  Compensation Payments and Other Payments for Federal Government Personnel under Chief of Mission  Authority (Section  1110).  The Department of State is currently authorized to provide additional compensation and medical benefits to its employees who are injured abroad while under the authority of a chief of mission.  Section 1110 expands eligibility for these additional benefits to other Federal   11  employees who likewise are injured under authority of the chief of  mission.  The Administration objects to  the provision because it would create ambiguity in the scope of coverage provided and uncertainty regarding the coordination of the expanded benefit and the benefits provided under  the Federal Employees\u2019  Compensation Act (FECA), increasing the risk of improper payments.   Competition requirements for purchases from Federal Prison Industries (Section 814).  The Administration supports section 814, which would remove the  five  percent statutory cap on DOD  non-competitive procurements from  Federal Prison Industries (\u201cFPI\u201d).  The cap prohibits FPI from  exceeding five  percent of the market share of DOD purchases in any  given product category without competition.    Development of Hypersonic and Ballistic Missile Tracking Space Sensor Payload (Sections 1651 and  1653).  The Administration appreciates the intent of section 1653 and agrees with the need to mature space-based sensing capabilities that could provide value for missile defense. The Administration, however,  objects to the requirement that the MDA  be solely responsible for the  development of the hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor payload  because it  would fragment space capabilities across multiple agencies.    Modification of Joint AI Research, Development and Transition Activities (Section 217).  The Administration strongly objects to section 217,  which would realign the Joint  Artificial  Intelligence Center (JAIC)  to the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DSD). Elevating JAIC  to  report directly to the DSD would afford the high visibility that DSD direct reports enjoy, as well as high priority in the Secretary of Defense\u2019s control of the budget request process  and ability to grant waivers from any bureaucratic process requirements not grounded in law. However, no matter where you place JAIC in the organization, oversight will need to be delegated to an organization (such as  the  DOD Chief Information Officer) that has the competency and expertise to lead and integrate JAIC capabilities into a broader portfolio.   Report on Risk to National Security Posed by Quantum  Computing Technologies (Section 1614). The Administration objects to provisions that have already been completed by the National Institute in Standards and Technology in (a)(2)(B) and (C) \u2013  the assessments of quantum-resistance cryptographic standards and the feasibility of alternate quantum-resistance models. Requiring DOD to report on these subjects would create confusion and could undermine these important efforts.   Renewal of Fallon Range Training Complex Land Withdrawal  and Reservation  (Section 2842).  The Administration appreciates section 2842, which would extend the current withdrawal and reservation of lands  known as the Fallon Range Training Complex (FRTC) to November 6, 2046. However, the Administration strongly urges Congress to adopt DOD\u2019s request to expand the FRTC to provide the area needed to fully accommodate  modern military training requirements. This requested expansion of the range is essential  to accommodate Naval Aviation and Sea, Air and Land (SEAL) training at Naval Air Station Fallon needed to support the National Defense Strategy. The FRTC is currently too small to accommodate realistic training with precision-guided munitions, and is too small for SEAL  ground mobility maneuver training in a tactical  and relevant environment.    12  Renewal of Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) Withdrawal and Reservation  (Section 2843).  The Administration supports renewal of the NTTR, but seeks inclusion of  additional expansion language, as capabilities and technologies have advanced at a rate that exceed the existing functional limits and geographic boundaries of the range. The expansion will create a facility that will allow the Air Force to realistically train with newly procured systems and munitions to enable the Air Force to train as it will fight.     Constitutional Concerns.  Certain provisions in this bill  raise constitutional concerns. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns  as this legislation advances.   13 ", "The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 4447. The Administration  supports clean energy, job development,  and the innovation economy  and adheres to a bottom-up energy philosophy that  promotes  free-markets, funds  scientific research, and honors  the choices of producers and consumers. This bill, however, would implement a top-down approach that would undermine the Administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda and empower  the government to select favored  solutions while reinstating big-government policies and programs.  H.R. 4447  would lead to higher  energy costs and discourage innovation and entrepreneurship. This legislation would bypass well-established processes and procedures and would impose substantial, unwarranted costs on Federal, State, and local agencies and other key stakeholders in both public and private sectors.  It would do so by  setting rigid energy savings and water consumption reduction targets for Federal agencies, requiring State and local governments to establish strict building codes that are not grounded in available technologies, and mandating a rigorous  transition from hydrofluorocarbon use in the private heating and cooling sector.   H.R. 4447  also fails on several other measures.  Its  proposed creation of new workforce  development, training, and other related programs is unnecessary and would lead to greater fragmentation of the workforce system and duplication of efforts between Federal agencies. To support the substantial costs of these programs, the bill would authorize  billions in new annual spending.  It  would also create a \u201cgreen bank\u201d that would subsidize projects similar to well-known failures like  Solyndra. It ignores the importance of permitting reform while endorsing more government control and mandates on goods and products  without consideration of the cost  to consumers. It would also set up new mandates and regulations that  would undo  the  Administration\u2019s significant progress  in lowering emissions  and  cleaning our air  and water. Finally, H.R. 4447 would interfere with how we have been  designing our own energy and environment destiny free from the reins of the Paris Climate Accord  and international agreements or organizations  that  ignore the clear lessons that have led to American energy independence.  Since January 2017, the  United States has experienced a remarkable turnaround in its energy fortunes. In a few short years, our  Nation has achieved energy independence and become a net  energy exporter and a world energy powerhouse.  We have increased  exports of United States  Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) by nearly five-fold and issued 20 long-term authorizations for LNG exports to non-free trade agreement countries.  The United States is  the number one  producer of oil  in the world and has maintained  its status as the top producer of nuclear power  and the top producer of natural gas, as well as the world\u2019s second-leading  generator  of wind and solar power.  Crucially, while dominating in energy production, the United States continues to lead the world in reducing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. Americans now have greater  access to energy that is abundant, affordable, clean, and reliable, and the Administration looks  forward to continuing our successful approach to build on these achievements.  If H.R. 4447 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 1230, the misleadingly named  Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act.  The  Administration believes  discrimination is never  acceptable  but is concerned with the potential harmful unintended consequences this legislation which would undo what works well in current  law.   Instead of protecting older workers, the bill would enrich trial lawyers and make it harder to identify and address genuine discrimination.   First,  H.R. 1230 reduces the burden of proof for  claims  under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,  retaliation  claims under Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act of  1964,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities Act,  and  the  Rehabilitation  Act.  Under current law, plaintiffs in these cases generally  must show that an employer would not have taken an employment action \u201cbut for\u201d a protected characteristic.  H.R. 1230 would allow plaintiffs to prevail and obtain limited  forms of  relief  if  the protected  characteristic was  a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the  employment action,  even if  the  employer  can demonstrate they would have taken the action,  for  example, because of poor  performance,  regardless  of  age.   Second, H.R. 1230 would nullify  decades of  judicial precedent  on which courts, employees, and employers have  relied  with few  offsetting  benefits.  In fact,  the  committee hearings revealed  there is little evidence that this change would increase the number of meritorious claims brought. Reducing the standard of causation from \u201cbut for\u201d to \u201cmotivating factor\u201d would, however, allow  more claims to proceed to  trial.  \u201cMotivating  factor\u201d  liability  may  be imposed when an employer  considered an impermissible factor, but the employer took the same adverse action it would have taken absent that consideration.  This  change  appears more likely to  open the floodgates to weak  or frivolous claims and  makes  it more difficult to  resolve  such claims at an early stage, diverting executive branch  and  judicial resources  away from addressing actual discrimination.   This would create additional work and income for trial lawyers but provide  little benefit to discrimination  victims.  Finally, H.R. 1230 would make resolving retaliation  claims  more difficult.  As the  Supreme Court has observed, reducing the standard of  causation  in  such cases  would incentivize  employees to file  frivolous claims  to  shield  themselves  from  being removed for valid reasons, including poor performance.  The current \u201cbut for\u201d standard appropriately allows employees to contest genuine discrimination while screening out frivolous charges.  H.R. 1230 would upset this  balance and  make it much more difficult for  employers to  address  workplace performance. If H.R. 1230 were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration  strongly opposes H.R. 3401, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations  for Humanitarian Assistance and Security  at the Southern Border Act, 2019.  After ignoring the  Administration\u2019s request  for desperately needed funding to address the humanitarian crisis at the  border for over  a month, and despite the efforts of  the House minority, the  House  majority  has  put forward a partisan bill that underfunds  necessary accounts and  seeks to  take advantage of the current crisis  by inserting policy provisions  that would make our country less safe.  The Administration is disappointed that neither the House nor Senate bills  include necessary  funding for  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)  detention.  By opposing detention beds\u2014where illegal migrants are placed pending their removal\u2014Democrat lawmakers  are declaring their belief that illegal immigrants, including those who skip court hearings or commit additional crimes, should be allowed to remain in our country indefinitely.  The ideological  aversion to our Nation\u2019s  interior immigration enforcement  agency must stop.  We cannot have a sovereign nation if we  continue to demean and underfund our enforcement agencies and  personnel.  In addition, H.R. 3401 declines to provide important funding for the equipment and courtroom space  necessary to support the  execution of the President\u2019s Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP)  to adjudicate illegal immigrant hearings, and fails to provide  any funding for Department of  Defense assistance to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) border  enforcement  efforts.  H.R. 3401 also  contains a number of problematic  policy provisions that would hinder the  Administration\u2019s efforts to enforce our immigration laws and protect children.  Among other  troublesome provisions that undermine child welfare, the bill would block the Administration from modifying  certain  Health and Human Services (HHS)  directives in order to prevent  children from being placed in danger in the  future.  Further undermining  child welfare, the bill includes onerous language impeding the  ability of  HHS to develop additional UAC influx  capacity, which  risks requiring children to remain in DHS custody for longer periods of time. H.R. 3401 would also  attempt to undermine MPP by requiring the provision of services to individuals in the program who are no longer in the United States, and by  prohibiting its use  altogether  for those families processed under  a new and untested migrant processing center  pilot program established by the bill.  Finally, the bill  would seek to block the  Administration\u2019s  current  policy of  foreign aid to Northern Triangle  countries, a necessary tool  for ensuring  enhanced control of migration from those countries.  Because this bill does not provide adequate funding to meet the  current crisis, and because it  contains partisan provisions designed to hamstring the Administration\u2019s border enforcement  efforts,  the Administration  opposes its passage.   If H.R. 3401 were presented to the President  in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 20, a joint resolution disapproving  arms sales to Bahrain.  This joint resolution relates to  $750 million in  Foreign Military Sales  (FMS) to Bahrain for a weapons  package  that supports  the F-16 Block 70/F-16V Aircraft fleet.   This package is intended for the sovereign defense of Bahrain, which is home to U.S. Naval  Forces Central Command, the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, the forward-deployed U.S. Marine  Central Command, Combined Maritime Force, and more than 17,000 United States  citizens.  The FMS case  at issue will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a major non-NATO partner and important security partner in the region.  Among other things, Bahrain supports United States activities and priorities related to anti-piracy efforts in the Arabian and Red Seas, and is an important partner in countering  Iran\u2019s nefarious activities and in countering al-Qa\u2019ida and ISIS throughout the region.  By helping to support thousands of jobs across 41 States, this FMS transaction  also promotes United States economic security  and strengthens our defense industrial base.    S.J. Res. 20 would negatively  affect the  bilateral relationship  between the United States and the Kingdom of  Bahrain.   If  S.J. Res.  20 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he veto it. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of  H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act of 2019.  This  legislation would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue certain regulations regarding perfluoroalkyl  and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).  This bill would supersede existing  statutory requirements  that require EPA, when regulating chemicals in the environment, to evaluate and weigh the available scientific and technical information about the  occurrence of exposures, the health effects of  exposures, the treatment options available, the  opportunities for meaningful improvement in public health protection, and the significant  potential effects on public safety.  By doing so, the bill would create  considerable litigation risk, set problematic and unreasonable rulemaking timelines and precedents, and impose substantial, unwarranted costs on Federal, State, and local agencies and other key stakeholders in both the  public and private sectors.   The Administration is aware of the public concern regarding  PFAS  and is committed to  responding to this  important public health issue.  The  EPA, through its PFAS Action Plan, is  taking extensive efforts to help communities address PFAS nationwide.  In this work, the EPA, along with other  Federal agencies, continues to follow the statutorily mandated regulatory  processes to evaluate  and determine the  appropriate actions needed to protect the  health  of the  American people, including actions to protect the  safety of our drinking  water. H.R. 535 would require the Administration  to bypass well-established processes, procedures, and legal requirements of the Nation\u2019s most fundamental environmental  laws, including the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Safe Drinking  Water Act;  the Toxic Substances Control Act;  the Clean Air Act; and the Solid Waste Disposal Act.  These laws establish  valuable processes to ensure public participation and transparency  and ensure that appropriate, scientifically sound actions  are taken to protect the American people.   Rather than allow EPA to regulate PFAS in accordance with the carefully  devised processes set  forth in these and other laws, the bill would simply  require EPA to put certain regulatory  measures in place.  The regulatory process works best when EPA and other agencies are free to devise regulations  based on the best available science and careful consideration of all the relevant facts.   By  truncating the rulemaking process, this legislation risks undermining public confidence in the  EPA\u2019s decisions, and also risks the imposition of  unnecessary costs on States, public water  systems, and others responsible for complying with its prescriptive mandates.  This bill also  disregards  implementation challenges.   H.R. 535 would impose a heavy burden on States, local  governments, and other potentially responsible parties by placing them in the  difficult position of having to implement stringent regulations before  any consideration of  whether such implementation is  even  feasible.   Given the  lack of  available,  effective,  low-cost  treatment,  disposal, and replacement  options  for PFAS, States,  local governments, public water  systems, and other potentially  responsible parties are likely to encounter barriers to compliance  and unintended negative  consequences, such  as  significantly reduced  effectiveness of firefighting  capabilities.  Additionally, sections 6  and  8-12 of H.R. 535 are  duplicative of provisions recently enacted into law under the  National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.  Enacting  duplicative  statutory requirements such as these, which pertain  to PFAS data calls and  reporting, PFAS destruction and disposal, and cooperative agreements with States,  could generate significant confusion  among stakeholders, and could waste  valuable resources in administering redundant or  perhaps even conflicting  provisions.  If H.R. 535  were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 53.  This resolution would nullify Administration rulemaking and guidance regarding section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This rulemaking establishes achievable and realistic standards that enable States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while providing affordable and reliable energy for all Americans.  This resolution would reinstate the Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was premised on a novel and expansive view of the EPA\u2019s statutory authority that was inconsistent with the CAA.  The CPP sought to reduce emissions by effectively mandating expensive shifts in the balance of coal-, gas-, and renewable-generated power across the Nation\u2019s power grid.  Instead of allowing market forces and technology to drive innovation, the CPP picked winners and losers across the energy industry.  After the CPP was issued in October 2015, 150 entities, including 27 States, challenged the rulemaking as being unlawful, and in 2016, the Supreme Court issued a stay of the rule that blocked it from taking effect. By contrast, the Trump Administration\u2019s Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule adheres to the CAA, provides States with new emission guidelines, and empowers States to choose the path to emissions reductions that is appropriate for their unique energy portfolio.  The ACE rule also identifies efficiency improvements that can help existing coal-fired electric utility generating units meet and achieve realistic greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  It will help ensure that the American public will have access to affordable and reliable energy. By seeking to repeal a reasonable regulation and restore an overreaching, unlawful rule, S.J. Res. 53 would disrupt the rule of law and interfere with States\u2019 efforts to continue to reduce emissions. If S.J. Res. 53 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  ** * * * * *  ", "The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 2740, as amended by the House Committee on Rules, making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related agencies, for the Department of Defense, for the Department of State, foreign operations, and related programs, and for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2020 and for other purposes.  The Administration is strongly opposed to the budgetary framework that underlies this and other appropriations bills being considered by the House of Representatives.  This framework would raise the discretionary spending caps by more than $350 billion in fiscal years (FY) 2020 and 2021 and does not reflect either a House-passed budget resolution or a bipartisan, bicameral agreement.  It would put the Federal Government on track to add nearly $2 trillion to deficits over 10 years, adding significantly to the national debt, which is already more than $22 trillion and rising.   In addition, the House Democrats\u2019 framework continues to adhere to the misguided and unfounded notion that increases to defense spending must be matched or exceeded by increases to non-defense spending.  In fact, the appropriations bills under consideration would provide more than twice as much additional funding in FY 2020 for non-defense programs as for defense programs, relative to FY 2019 levels.  Investing in our national security remains a key Administration priority, but strengthening our defense does not require additional non-defense discretionary spending.  Overall, according to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 2740 would spend $984.7 billion\u2014 $63.4 billion, or 6.9 percent, above the FY 2020 Budget request and $31.5 billion above the FY 2019 enacted level.  In addition, this legislation includes a number of particularly problematic provisions implicating key Administration priorities, including provisions that would block implementation of new Title X and conscience protection rules at the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as restrict implementation of the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy.  The bill also includes problematic language that would prohibit the transfer and execution of funds to improve our Nation\u2019s border security, and that would otherwise impede immigration enforcement. If H.R. 2740 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the House Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill. Division A\u2014Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020 Department of Labor Apprenticeship. The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for the expansion of apprenticeship model, but opposes its restriction that the funding only be spent on registered apprenticeships.  This restriction limits the Department\u2019s ability to engage employers in adopting the apprenticeship model, particularly employers in industries in which apprenticeships are not already common.  Protecting Union Members. The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s underfunding of the Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS).  The increase requested in the FY 2020 Budget is necessary to restore OLMS\u2019s investigative workforce and strengthen protections for transparency for union members by supporting more audits and investigations to uncover flawed officer elections, fraud, and embezzlement. Job Corps. The bill provides $1.9 billion for Job Corps, ensuring excessive funds would continue to be spent on low-performing centers that are failing students.  The Administration continues to strongly support reforms to create a program to better prepare youth for jobs and keep them safe while doing so. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC). While the Administration appreciates the funding that the bill provides for the UAC program, the level provided in the bill would be insufficient to meet current program needs, which are at crisis levels, as acknowledged in the recent humanitarian supplemental request.  The Administration urges the Congress to include the $2 billion mandatory contingency fund proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request, which is the most effective way to manage the inherent uncertainty in this program.  The Administration also opposes the numerous provisions that might impede HHS\u2019s ability to effectively operate the UAC program and to protect the safety of children in HHS\u2019s care, and provisions that would create additional barriers preventing the Government from enforcing the Nation\u2019s immigration laws. Opioids. The Administration appreciates that the bill includes funding to fight the opioids epidemic, most notably the $1.5 billion provided for State grants to address opioid abuse including prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. Ending HIV Epidemic Initiative. The Administration appreciates that the bill includes funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Health Resources and Services Administration, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to undertake this priority initiative. 2  NIH.  The Administration supports the inclusion of funding for high priority research areas identified in the FY 2020 Budget request, such as the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative.  However, the bill also includes funding for NIH in excess of $7 billion above the FY 2020 Budget request.  The Administration supports strategic funding to accelerate the development of treatments and strongly opposes across-the-board increases to the NIH topline that are unsustainable and redirect resources from the highest priority research.  In addition, the Administration is disappointed that the bill does not consolidate the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality activities in NIH, as requested in the FY 2020 Budget.  The Administration strongly supports better coordination of health services research and the elimination of funding for potentially duplicative or lower priority activities. Title X Family Planning. The Administration opposes language that would prevent implementation of the new rule that would ensure compliance with statutory Title X program integrity provisions among HHS programs, in particular the prohibition on funding of programs wherein abortion is a method of family planning.  The new rule makes notable improvements designed to increase the number of patients served and to improve the quality of care they receive.  In addition, the bill includes $114 million more than the FY 2020 Budget request for Title X Family Planning.  The Administration is also disappointed that the bill does not contain language requested in the FY 2020 Budget that would prohibit Federal funding from being provided to certain providers of abortion services. CDC, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides unrequested funding for NIOSH activities, which is contributing to the overall excessive spending in the bill.  The bill provides $346 million, which is $156 million more than requested in the FY 2020 Budget. Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program. The Administration opposes the bill\u2019s inclusion of $110 million in unrequested funds for the TPP program.  The bill also requires that the Administration continue to fund through 2020 grants awarded for FYs 2015 through 2019. The TPP program began in FY 2010 to provide competitive grants to replicate successful TPP approaches, test new TPP approaches, and identify the effectiveness of these interventions.  The TPP program serves less than one percent of teenagers in the United States.  Although the teenage pregnancy rate has declined significantly, the evidence suggests that TPP has not been a major driver in that reduction. Conscience Protection Rule Implementation Prohibition.  The Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of section 240 of the bill, which prohibits the HHS Office for Civil Rights from using appropriated funds to finalize, implement, or enforce the newly published conscience protection final rule.  This rule protects conscience rights for healthcare entities and professionals. Reassignment of Medicaid Provider Claims.  The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s prohibition on the use of funds to implement the final rule to Protect Medicaid Provider Payments.  This rule ensures that any diversions of Medicaid providers\u2019 payments are consistent with statute. 3  Medicaid Nonemergency Medical Transportation (NEMT). The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s prohibition on the use of funds to publish the forthcoming Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rule to provide States with greater flexibility regarding the provision of NEMT for Medicaid beneficiaries. Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research. The Administration is concerned that the bill requires the CDC and NIH to fund research on firearm injury and mortality prevention. Indirect Costs. The Administration objects to the inclusion of section 224, which prohibits changes to the method that NIH uses to pay grantee institutions for facilities and administrative costs. The section also prohibits other Federal departments and agencies from developing or implementing modified indirect cost policies, which inhibits agency staff and stakeholders from developing strategies to maximize the effectiveness of Federal Government programs and reduce burden.  Syringe Services General Provision. The Administration notes that the bill does not continue the general provision in current law allowing the use of Federal funds to support elements of evidence-based syringe services programs, as requested in the FY 2020 Budget.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that these important services can continue to protect Americans from the infectious disease consequences of opioid and other drug use, improve rates of addiction treatment and recovery services, and improve public health, consistent with current law. Department of Education Unnecessary Department of Education Programs. The Administration is concerned that the bill funds 29 programs that the Administration has proposed for elimination in the FY 2020 Budget request.  Eliminating these programs, which are either duplicative, narrowly focused, or unable to demonstrate effectiveness, would save $6.7 billion in FY 2020. Charter Schools. The Administration is concerned that the bill reduces funding for charter schools by $40 million below the FY 2019 enacted level.  The $500 million requested in the FY 2020 Budget for charter schools is critical to the Administration\u2019s efforts to provide more families with high-quality educational options.  In addition, the bill does not provide the Department of Education with the flexibility needed to efficiently allocate funding to charter school programs based on applicant demand.  Expansion of Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Administration opposes the wasteful $350 million funding level provided in the bill for a temporary benefit in the Federal Direct Student Loan program that expands Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility.  The Administration\u2019s FY 2020 Budget request proposes to eliminate the PSLF program, which unfairly favors certain career choices over others, and instead focuses assistance on undergraduate student borrowers from all professions through a single income-based repayment plan. Other Independent Agencies 4  Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS). The Administration opposes the $1.1 billion funding level for CNCS.  This funding is unnecessary and wasteful, as the Corporation\u2019s mission is not a core Government function.  Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).  The Administration proposes to eliminate Federal funding for CPB in the FY 2020 Budget request and opposes the $495 million funding level for FY 2022 provided for CPB through the two-year advance appropriation.  CPB grants represent a small share of the total funding for the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio and the Administration believes private donations would be sufficient to fund these operations. Division B\u2014Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2020 Department of Defense (DOD) Defense Base and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Funding.  The Administration strongly objects to the allocation in the bill between base defense funding and OCO funding.  As outlined in the FY 2020 Budget request, the Administration prefers to limit base national defense funding to the current law discretionary cap, while using both OCO and emergency funding to provide the necessary resources to support the National Defense Strategy (NDS).  This approach is vital to ensure that necessary funding to defend the Nation is not dependent on another budget agreement or legislation increasing the base budget defense cap in current law. Transfer Authority. The Administration strongly objects to language in sections 8005 and 9002 of the bill that would significantly decrease DOD\u2019s general and special transfer authorities. Specifically, section 8005 of the bill would limit DOD\u2019s base budget general transfer authority to $1 billion in FY 2020, $4 billion below the FY 2020 Budget request.  Section 9002 of the bill would limit OCO special transfer authority to $0.5 billion in FY 2020, $4 billion below the FY 2020 Budget request.  Limiting DOD\u2019s transfer authorities would severely constrain the Department\u2019s ability to shift funds between accounts to meet unforeseen or emerging military requirements.  Border Funding. The Administration strongly objects to language in section 8127 of the bill that would prohibit the use of FY 2020 or prior-year defense appropriations to construct barriers or security infrastructure along the southern border.  The Administration also objects to restrictions included in the bill that would prohibit DOD from augmenting counter-drug appropriations using transfer authority, or using counter-drug appropriations for the construction of fences under section 284 of Title 10, United States Code.  The use of prior-year appropriations and transfer authority are critical to assist Department of Homeland Security (DHS) efforts to secure and manage the southern border.  Physical barriers impede the flow of illegal crossings, drugs, and other contraband, and therefore make DHS efforts at the border more effective. Space Force.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s recognition that space capabilities are an integral part of the Nation\u2019s security and economy, the bill only provides $15 million to study the establishment of the United States Space Force, which is $57 million below the FY 2020 Budget request.  Over the last 20 years, various commissions authorized by 5  the Congress and the Government Accountability Office have studied DOD\u2019s current organizational structure and have reached the same conclusion\u2014DOD is not properly structured for the challenges the Nation faces in space.  We look forward to working with the Congress to authorize and fully fund the Space Force.  Insufficient resources could delay its establishment, putting at risk the Nation\u2019s ability to adapt to the rapidly changing warfighting domain of space.  Republic of Turkey. Section 8111 of the bill would prohibit the use of any funds to deliver F-35 aircraft or related equipment to the Republic of Turkey.  The Administration shares the concerns reflected in the bill regarding the transfer of F-35s should Turkey purchase the S-400, which is incompatible with its continued participation in the F-35 program.  However, section 8111 of the bill is unacceptable as currently written as it could prohibit delivery of F-35s even if Turkey foregoes the S-400 system.  The Administration supports ongoing discussions between the United States and Turkey and seeks to retain Turkey in the F-35 program, as long as Turkey declines the S-400 system.  Removal of United States Armed Forces from Yemen.  The Administration strongly objects to the language in section 10002 of the bill that would require the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen, except for operations directed at al Qaeda or associated forces.  Removal of United States Armed Forces would harm bilateral relationships in the region, negatively affect the military\u2019s ability to prevent the spread of violent extremist organizations, and would establish a bad precedent for future legislation by defining \u201chostilities\u201d to include defense cooperation activities such as aerial refueling.  In addition, the Administration\u2019s continued cooperation with regional partner nations allows the United States to support diplomatic negotiations to end the conflict, promote humanitarian access, mitigate civilian casualties, and defeat terrorists who seek to harm the United States. Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The Administration strongly objects to section 9025 of the bill, which would repeal the current AUMF.  The 2001 and 2002 AUMFs grant the United States the legal authority to fight the counter-terrorism campaign against the Taliban, al Qaeda, and associated forces, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.  While DOD is not seeking a new or revised AUMF, the Department continues to participate in productive discussions with the Congress on the 2001 AUMF.  Arbitrarily repealing the 2001 AUMF would risk the military\u2019s ability to pursue and defeat terrorists who seek to harm the United States and the Nation\u2019s interests at home and abroad.  Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). The Administration strongly objects to the $108 million reduction in funding in the bill for the GBSD, the Minuteman III/Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) replacement. Failure to provide the full funding requested in the FY 2020 Budget would lead to delays in planned contract awards, increase the risk of not meeting the Combatant Commander\u2019s timelines, and hinder the Department\u2019s effort to replace the aging ICBM fleet. Intermediate Range Cruise Missile Capability. The Administration strongly objects to the elimination of research and development funding in the bill for Intermediate Range Cruise Missile capability. This elimination would disadvantage the United States in the event that Russia does not return to compliance with its obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear 6  Forces Treaty (INF) by the August 2, 2019 deadline endorsed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  The reduction would leave the United States unprepared to respond to the post-INF military environment that will have been created by Russia. Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD).  The Administration strongly objects to the $500 million reduction in funding in the bill for the NGAD program.  This 50 percent funding reduction from the FY 2020 Budget request would have a severe impact on the ability of the program to field NGAD capabilities that will be needed in the 2030 timeframe to meet the growing challenges of peer adversaries.  Full funding of NGAD is also critical for maintaining a strong United States industrial base capable of building the world\u2019s most advanced aircraft.  Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E). The Administration objects to the reduced funding in the bill for RDT&E.  The bill provides $101 billion for RDT&E\u2014$3 billion below the FY 2020 Budget request.  Underfunding RDT&E would constrain DOD\u2019s ability to make key investments in research, engineering, and prototyping to maintain the military\u2019s technological superiority. Unmanned Surface Vessels.  While the Administration applauds the Committee\u2019s recognition that Large Unmanned Surface Vessels will provide a more distributed, lethal, and survivable navy, the bill only provides $307 million for these systems, $200 million below the FY 2020 Budget request.  These are critical experimentation vessels with modular payloads to reduce risk, conduct integration and testing of payloads, and develop Navy tactics and concepts of operations.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully support this critical capability at the levels in the FY 2020 Budget request. Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR).  The Administration strongly objects to the $202 million reduction, and the obligation and expenditure limitation, in the bill that would reduce and withhold funding for Next-Gen OPIR.  The levels proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request are essential to hire personnel for design work and to purchase materials to meet the Department\u2019s fielding timeline.  Strategic missile warning is a \u201cno-fail\u201d mission and without full funding, the program would be delayed by a minimum of one year.  Multiple Munitions Reductions.  The Administration objects to the $562 million reduction in the bill for critical warfighter munitions, which would further reduce key weapons stores.  The FY 2020 Budget request increases procurement of preferred and advanced munitions to build war reserves and successfully execute the NDS.  Stable and consistent annual procurements are vital to increasing DOD\u2019s lethality and warfighting capability. Unobligated Balance Reductions. The Administration objects to the $1.6 billion in reductions across Military Personnel and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) accounts.  These reductions fail to account for actions already taken by the Armed Forces to reduce these balances.  If enacted, the reductions to the Military Personnel accounts would be applied to military pay and allowance programs and would directly affect the Department\u2019s ability to fund full-spectrum readiness recovery efforts, including the Services\u2019 planned growth in forces.  For O&M accounts, these reductions would negate the Committee\u2019s otherwise clear intent to support defense readiness, and would directly and negatively impact key readiness priorities including 7  depot maintenance, base operations support, communications, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization. Division C\u2014Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2020 Department of State and Other International Programs International Affairs Topline. The Administration opposes the bill topline level, which far exceeds the amount requested in the FY 2020 Budget request.  This is counter to Administration efforts to rein in non-defense discretionary funding and eliminate the use of OCO funding for Function 150 programs.  For example, the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development funding level is $12.4 billion, or 31 percent, above the FY 2020 Budget request. U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided for DFC administrative expenses, but is concerned that the bill significantly underfunds the new Agency\u2019s programs.  In particular, the bill provides $50 million for the DFC\u2019s new equity program, $100 million, or 67 percent, below the FY 2020 Budget request.  This level undermines an Administration and congressional priority to provide the DFC with a tool that would catalyze additional investment for development and national security objectives by mobilizing the private sector. Middle East Assistance. The Administration appreciates that the bill supports funding for key partners in the Middle East, including $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Israel in support of the 10-year Memorandum of Understanding, bilateral assistance to Jordan in support of the strong, strategic United States-Jordan relationship, and security and economic assistance to other key partners, including Egypt. Economic and Development Assistance. The Administration opposes the high level of spending provided in the bill for economic and development assistance.  The funding in the bill exceeds what is needed to support United States national security, promote United States prosperity and economic opportunities, and advance American interests and values around the world.  The bill also does not consolidate this funding into one Economic Support and Development Fund appropriation, as was proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request, maintaining unnecessary accounts with specialized objectives and limiting flexibility. International Organizations Contributions. The Administration opposes the significant increases for assessed and voluntary contributions to international organizations, including increased funding for the International Organizations and Programs account, which the FY 2020 Budget request proposed to eliminate.  The funding provided in the bill is counter to the goals of the FY 2020 Budget request, which fully funds international organizations that are critical to national security, while also signaling America\u2019s commitment to greater accountability and transparency and more equitable cost-sharing among members.  In addition, the Administration is concerned that the bill would waive the 25 percent statutory cap on United States peacekeeping assessments for prior years, and require use of taxpayer funds to pay assessments 8  in excess of the statutory cap despite the failure of the United Nations to act on United States cost sharing proposals. Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund).  The Administration is disappointed that the bill misses an opportunity to seek improved international burden sharing in support of the Global Fund.  The bill provides more than $600 million above the FY 2020 Budget request.  While the Administration supports the work of the Global Fund, the proposal in the FY 2020 Budget request would challenge other donors to do more, and use prior year funds that other donors have not matched, rather than increasing United States funding unilaterally.  The bill instead would undermine the previous matching pledge and require the United States to play a larger role, even while the combination of United States bilateral and multilateral efforts already represent well above half of global funding to combat AIDS. Program Eliminations and Reductions. The Administration is concerned that the bill increases or maintains funding that the Administration proposed to eliminate or substantially reduce in the FY 2020 Budget request.  This includes:  Educational and Cultural Exchanges; the African Development Foundation; the Inter-American Foundation; the Asia Foundation; the East-West Center; the International Fund for Agricultural Development; the U.S. Agency for Global Media; the U.S. Institute of Peace; and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. Mexico City Policy, Other Abortion Restrictions, and Family Planning. The Administration strongly opposes sections 7058(a) and 7064 of the bill that would effectively block the Administration\u2019s implementation of the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy, which prohibits the funding of foreign non-governmental organizations that promote or perform abortions. The Administration is also concerned that the bill restores unrequested funding for the United Nations Population Fund, an organization determined by the Secretary of State to support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. Reduced Flexibility. The Administration strongly opposes provisions that would significantly reduce the Administration\u2019s flexibility to allocate funds to achieve foreign policy objectives. Section 7019 of the bill again requires that allocations for assistance accounts conform to numerous detailed congressional funding directives. However, this section goes significantly beyond restrictions in prior acts which have allowed the Administration to respond to changing conditions and apply exceptions on a case-by-case basis for urgent or unforeseen needs by both lowering the threshold for authorized deviations and\u2014crucially\u2014not allowing for exceptions previously permitted.  In addition, the Administration opposes the revision of section 7011, which by limiting the amount of time funds are available for reprogramming, would significantly hamper the Administration\u2019s ability to ensure that tax payer resources are being used most effectively to support programmatic needs in response to evolving circumstances on the ground and foreign policy priorities. Paris Agreement. The Administration strongly opposes section 7060 of the bill, which prevents funding from being used to notify withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.  The provision is inconsistent with the President\u2019s announced intentions.  Venezuela Transition. The Administration is concerned that the bill fails to provide requested 9  authority to flexibly respond to the crisis in Venezuela.  Special transfer authority would enable the United States to initiate additional programming quickly to support a democratic transition and related needs.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide such authority in a final bill to support the people of Venezuela in their fight against tyranny. Foreign Military Financing (FMF) Loan Authority. The Administration is disappointed that the bill fails to include authority requested to provide FMF loans and guarantees, which the Administration views as an important tool for making United States defense equipment a more competitive and affordable option for partner countries. Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Reorganization. The Administration is concerned that the bill excludes provisions proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request that would strengthen and improve outdated and fragmented overseas humanitarian assistance, including a new International Humanitarian Assistance account where spending could adjust flexibly to meet the needs of affected populations as crises drive populations back and forth across borders and within their own countries.  In addition, section 7006 of the bill retains language enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 that limits improvements to the United States humanitarian structure by unnecessarily micromanaging how bureaus are managed and funds are administered.  The Administration believes that a stronger and seamlessly coherent Federal Government structure that elevates humanitarian assistance is needed to resolve conflicts underlying the largest crises while optimizing the outcomes for both beneficiaries and American taxpayers. Secretary of State Travel Restriction. The Administration is concerned that the bill seeks to limit the Secretary of State\u2019s travel expenses unless certain timelines are met for submission of the Department\u2019s congressional budget justification materials and allocations of appropriated resources.  Such action could adversely affect the ability of the Secretary to support United States national security objectives, and therefore should be deleted. Central America Strategy. The Administration is concerned that sections 7045(a)(l)(A) and 7045(a)(l)(B) of the bill retroactively amend and make more restrictive language providing funding in support of the Central America Strategy.  Such language would restrict the flexibility available to the President and Secretary of State to allocate foreign assistance funding in support of United States foreign policy objectives and further complicates compliance with numerous other congressional directives. Saudi Arabia. The Administration opposes section 704l(i) of the bill, which purports to impose restrictions on funding related to how the Administration should approach civil nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia.  The Administration opposes language that would in any way aim to restrict flexibility available to the Secretary of State pursuant to authorities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended).  The language also weakens the Administration\u2019s ability to support the United States civil nuclear industry\u2019s pursuit of commercial opportunities internationally, at a time when the entire Federal Government should be instead redoubling efforts to counter Russian and Chinese influence in the civil nuclear market worldwide. 10  Division D\u2014Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020 Corps of Engineers Infrastructure. The bill fails to extend section 1043 of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, as amended, which authorizes non-Federal implementation of construction of Federal projects, an important tool for reforming and improving investment in water resources. Transparency. The Administration is disappointed that the bill fails to revise appropriations language in five accounts as proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request to enable greater transparency in how funds are spent.  Establishing separate appropriations accounts for the navigation trust funds would improve accountability, ensure appropriations are used in a manner consistent with statutory requirements, and increase transparency for the public, including the users that pay fees to finance some of these costs.  Southern Border Wall Construction. The Administration objects to the inclusion of section 108 in the bill which would preclude the use of funds provided by the bill, or any prior Act, for the Civil Works program, for use on the design or construction of any border security infrastructure along the southern border. Department of Energy Plutonium Sustainment. The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s reduction of $220 million from the FY 2020 Budget request for Plutonium Sustainment within the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The requested level is necessary to meet the DOD requirement to produce no fewer than 80 pits per year by 2030.  This 32 percent reduction would significantly delay the NNSA\u2019s efforts to improve safety and security features while modernizing the stockpile.  In addition, delaying the program would force NNSA to further increase future pit production capacity to address plutonium aging, thereby requiring a larger and more costly pit manufacturing capability. W87-1 Modification Program. The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s reduction of $59 million from the FY 2020 Budget request for the W87-1 Modification Program. The W87-1 would provide enhanced safety and security compared to the legacy W78 that it is replacing. The 53 percent funding reduction would delay the program, increase its cost, and force it out of alignment with DOD\u2019s plans to deploy the next generation intercontinental ballistic missile, thereby adding risks and costs to maintain and qualify the existing warhead. Nuclear Counterterrorism and Incident Response (NCTIR).  The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s reduction of $32 million from the FY 2020 Budget request for the NCTIR program.  This reduction would compromise DOE ability to execute an interagency effort to speed life-saving responses in the event of a nuclear incident in the United States. Under the Capability Forward model, DOE would provide enhanced training and equipment to regional Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) teams, enabling them to render safe a nuclear device.  Given the 11  interdependence of DOE and FBI in executing the Capability Forward initiative, if the agencies\u2019 budgets do not remain synchronized, the timeline for fielding enhanced capabilities to United States cities would be severely disrupted.  Nonproliferation Fuels Development. The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s inclusion of funding for development of high-density, low-enriched fuels that could replace highly enriched uranium for naval applications.  In 2018, the Secretaries of Energy and the Navy jointly determined that the United States should not pursue research and development of an advanced naval nuclear fuel system based on low-enriched uranium since such a system would result in a reactor design that is inherently less capable, more expensive, and unlikely to support the significant cost savings associated with life-of-ship submarine reactors. To fully execute a development effort of this magnitude would also incur significant risk and compete for resources against other defense priorities. Applied Energy Programs. The Administration believes the bill provides excessive funding for DOE\u2019s applied energy programs.  The bill provides $5 billion for these programs, $3 billion more than the FY 2020 Budget request.  The Administration urges the Congress to restrain funding levels in these programs and focus resources on early-stage research and development (R&D) across the applied energy technology spectrum rather than late-stage or near-commercial ready technology.  Loan Programs. The Administration is disappointed that the bill maintains the Title XVII Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, and the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program.  The FY 2020 Budget request proposed to eliminate these programs and fund only the minimum administrative expenses necessary to monitor the existing portfolio.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the elimination proposal in order to recognize the private sector\u2019s primary role in taking risks to finance projects in the energy and automobile manufacturing sectors.  Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E). The Administration believes that the continued funding of ARPA-E makes little strategic sense given the existence of applied energy research elsewhere within the Department.  The Administration urges the Congress to eliminate ARPA-E and incorporate its more successful elements, such as coordination with industry and cross-cutting research, into the Department\u2019s applied energy programs. Petroleum Reserve Sales.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill fails to include language implementing the liquidation and sale of the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve and Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve.  Both of these reserves are costly to maintain, operationally inefficient, and have never been used for their intended purpose.  Environmental Management. The Administration opposes the $706 million increase, $487 million of which is defense funding, for the Environmental Management program.  The bill allocates more than half of this increase to the Hanford site in Washington State, where the Department\u2019s Inspector General recently compiled concerns regarding mismanagement, weak internal controls, and fraud.  The Administration urges the Congress to reallocate these funds to higher national security priorities. 12  Office of Science.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for basic R&D in the Office of Science.  However, the bill provides $6.9 billion, $1.4 billion more than the FY 2020 Budget request.  The Administration urges the Congress to use restraint in funding these programs.  Versatile Advanced Test Reactor.  The Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s support for the Versatile Advanced Test Reactor.  However, the Administration believes that the bill is substantially underinvesting in this priority. While the Administration agrees that the most cost-effective approach should be used and mechanisms such as international cost-sharing should be considered, the insufficient funding provided in the bill would contribute to problematic delays and negative impacts on the project\u2019s ability to achieve its strategic goals. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation.  The bill provides $1.6 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project (CUP), $528 million or 50 percent above the FY 2020 Budget request.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s investment in water resources through the Bureau of Reclamation and CUP, but believes funding should be limited to the amount in the FY 2020 Budget request and should be focused on the highest priority needs from a national perspective.  Constitutional Concerns Certain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, certain sections would interfere with the President\u2019s authority as Commander in Chief.  Certain other provisions would contravene the constitutional separation of powers between the Executive Branch and the Congress.  In particular, these provisions would require congressional committee approval of certain Executive actions, in violation of INS v. Chadha. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2020 appropriations process moves forward. * * * * * * * 13  ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 4863, the United States Export Finance Agency Act of 2019.  This bill creates significant obstacles to achieving the mission of the Export-Import Bank and includes provisions that would create excessive costs and burdensome reporting structures, which could delay project approval and implementation.  The Export-Import Bank must remain flexible so it can counter alternative sources of project financing from international competitors, such as China, that make use of a diverse array of credit agencies.  More specifically, the Administration has always supported using all energy sources and technologies as cleanly and efficiently as possible.  The Administration supports an energy source and technology-neutral approach to financing that discourages the consideration of non-market criteria in the financing process.  The Administration is committed to the long-term reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. H.R. 4863, however, does not represent the type of bipartisan, bicameral approach needed to appropriately accomplish that goal.  If H.R. 4863 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 21, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, providing appropriations for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2019, for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Justice, Interior, State, Transportation, Treasury, and for other purposes.  The Administration also opposes passage of H.J. Res. 1, providing appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through February 8, 2019, and for other purposes.  The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to reopen lapsed agencies, but cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nation\u2019s urgent border security needs. In recent months, the number of people attempting to cross the border illegally has risen to 2,000 per day.  Based on 2017 data, an average of more than 300 Americans a week were killed in heroin-involved overdoses\u2014and Mexico is the source of nearly 90 percent of wholesale heroin seized by law enforcement in the United States.  In FYs 2017 and 2018, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested close to 211,000 aliens convicted of criminal offenses and an additional 55,000 aliens charged with criminal offenses.   The first duty of the Federal Government is to defend the Nation and its citizens, which is why President Donald J. Trump has made addressing illegal immigration one of his top priorities since taking office.  Specifically, the Administration has repeatedly encouraged the Congress to provide resources needed for DHS to secure the border.  For FY 2019, the Administration has made it clear that the Government needs an investment of at least $5 billion for border security, along with the flexibility necessary to utilize these funds efficiently.  The appropriations bill, H.R. 21, and the corresponding H.J. Res. 1, does not come close to providing these necessary investments and authorities. Despite not meeting the minimum requirements identified by those who are directly responsible for the Nation\u2019s border security, this package funds a number of unnecessary programs at excessive levels well beyond what was put forward in the FY 2019 Budget.  The six bills provided for under H.R. 21 provide funding at levels nearly 20 percent higher than the President\u2019s FY 2019 Budget.  For instance, H.R. 21 provides $12 billion more for international  affairs programs, 29 percent higher than the President\u2019s request.  This includes $2.9 billion more than the request for economic and development assistance, including funding for the West Bank/Gaza, Syria, and Pakistan, where our foreign aid is either frozen or under review.  It includes $700 million more than requested for the United Nations, including restoring funding for the United Nations Population Fund. The bill would also undermine the President\u2019s Mexico City Policy (Presidential Memorandum of January 23, 2017), which prohibits the funding of foreign nongovernmental organizations that promote or perform abortions.  Further, H.R. 21 includes approximately $2 billion in excessive Environmental Protection Agency funding, providing funds beyond the Agency\u2019s core mission and including funding for programs that can and should be executed at the local level.  The bill also includes substantial unrequested funding for HUD programs, including $7.1 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request for HUD rental assistance programs.  These and other excessive spending items makes the lack of adequate border funding in the combined package all the more unacceptable. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that will adequately secure the Nation\u2019s borders and get the Federal Government back to work for the American people as soon as possible. If either H.R. 21 or H.J. Res. 1 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration opposes  passage of  H.R. 8294.  The mission of the Department of Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration is  to expand access to high-quality job training and employment opportunities.  Unfortunately, H.R. 8294 would undermine the ability of the Department of Labor  to perform that  mission under the mistaken belief that the government, rather than employers or  jobseekers, is best suited to determine the skills and competencies necessary for success on the job.  This bill  would  also  require a one-size-fits-all approach to apprenticeship that would stifle the Department\u2019s ability to promote innovation in the  apprenticeship system and ensure that as many Americans as possible have access to high-quality work-based learning opportunities.  At the same time, it would limit  the ability of the Department to promote labor standards necessary to safeguard the welfare of apprentices.  In the name of expanding apprenticeship opportunities, H.R. 8294 would eliminate such opportunities  at a  time when many Americans are struggling to find a family-sustaining job.  Effective workforce development and education initiatives  require collaboration with employers. The command-and-control method of skill identification and development embodied in this bill  fails to reflect labor market realities and the necessity of continually adapting programs to keep pace with changing business practices.   The Administration has consistently recognized the value of the earn-and-learn opportunities that  apprenticeships provide and has worked to promote apprenticeships.   Since President Trump took office, more than 850,000 apprentices have been hired thanks to efforts to support economic opportunity for all Americans.  On June 15, 2017,  President Trump signed an executive order  creating the Task Force on Apprenticeship Expansion.  This Task Force, which includes  employers, labor unions, and educators,  identified the following as key factors in the success of the apprenticeship model: the development of progressively advancing workplace-relevant skills and knowledge, paid work,  an educational component, structured mentorship, and the attainment of an industry-recognized credential.   The Task Force found that the Registered Apprenticeship program  succeeded in the area of building trades but the rigid framework of the program limited the adoption of Registered Apprenticeships by  other industries  in a 21st  century economy.   Based on these findings, the Administration used  the  flexibility provided under the National  Apprenticeship Act to create the complementary Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Program.  Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs are individual  programs that participate in the   program as a whole, and they are  helping  employers create more earn-and-learn  opportunities for American jobseekers, including traditionally under-represented populations,  in new and emerging fields and occupations.   The Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Program  has already engaged  a broader  array of industries, a larger number of employers, and a more diverse population than the Registered  Apprenticeship program.  This program recognizes the important  role of employers and employer associations  in  making programmatic decisions while ensuring labor market protections and increasing pay transparency.  Moreover, the program  is increasing  economic opportunity for all Americans while increasing diversity and inclusion in the workplace.  Program  administrators are responsible for performing outreach to diverse populations and ensuring apprentices are protected from harassment, intimidation, and retaliation,  while individual employers commit to reporting on the future employment and earnings of apprentices.  Unfortunately, H.R. 8294 would eliminate the  authority of the Department of Labor to  leverage additional apprenticeship models, such as Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, thereby  reducing apprenticeship opportunities  for workers who do not have access to them now  and rolling back worker  protections.   If H.R.  8294  were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 8406.  As with the original HEROES Act (H.R. 6800), which faced bipartisan opposition in the House in May, this bill is filled with longstanding partisan proposals that would do nothing to enhance our Nation\u2019s ability to deal with the public health and economic challenges we face.  Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the Administration has worked tirelessly to mobilize our Nation\u2019s vast resources to combat the virus and help people and businesses that are suffering.  The Administration is ready to continue working with Congress to support the American people in our fight against the coronavirus, but unfortunately, H.R. 8406 would not build on the progress we have already made. On four separate occasions, the President has worked with Congress in a bipartisan manner to respond to the outbreak by enacting legislation of unprecedented size and breadth.  President Trump has signed legislation that includes almost $2.5 trillion in spending to improve public health, support small businesses, and bridge the gap for individuals and families as they deal with the challenges presented by the coronavirus.  The Administration will continue its efforts to reach a bipartisan agreement to provide additional funding to support our public health response to the coronavirus and to continue the Nation\u2019s economic recovery, along with liability protection for universities, schools, and businesses.  Unfortunately, H.R. 8406 prioritizes ideological objectives at the expense of real progress to help Americans through these challenging times.  As a result, the Administration cannot support H.R. 8406. If H.R. 8406 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. ** * * * * * ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5687, which would make  emergency  supplemental appropriations for the fiscal  year  ending September 30, 2020.  Division A  of the bill provides an additional $4.7 billion  in disaster relief  designed for  Puerto Rico, which is already projected to receive $90 billion in disaster funds.  Division B would make permanent changes to  the Nation\u2019s tax code and provide  more than $15 billion in Federal subsidies that are unrelated to immediate disaster relief  and recovery.   Further, the House is rushing this  bill through its process\u2014and seeking to push taxpayer dollars  out the door\u2014even before the Federal Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA) has completed its review of the damage caused by  earthquakes that have recently affected the island.   The Administration has taken unprecedented steps to help the people of Puerto Rico after  recent disasters.  FEMA\u2019s response  to Hurricane Maria was  historic in scope, including the  longest sustained air support  mission in United States history, which provided food and water  to the island, the largest disaster commodity distribution mission in United States  history, and the largest sea-bridge operation of  Federal disaster  aid in United States  history.  In addition, President  Trump approved funding for 100 percent of  Puerto Rico\u2019s  emergency work  cost-share for nearly  a  year, the third longest period of time  ever  granted by a President.   For Hurricane Maria alone,  FEMA  has completed  more than 110,000 repairs of individual homes, approved $3.5 billion in assistance to individuals, and granted  $6.1 billion in public assistance.  The Department of Housing  and Urban Development  has  released $9.7 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster  Recovery  funding.  Of this total, $1.5 billion has been obligated, but Puerto Rico has spent only  $11 million.  To date, the Federal Government has allocated a total of  $44 billion across 14 agencies to disasters in Puerto Rico, and of those funds, $22 billion has been obligated.  Of the amount  obligated, $8 billion remains unspent.  In total, the  overall spending on these disasters in Puerto Rico is projected to be  at least $90 billion. FEMA has similarly acted swiftly to respond to the earthquakes that began in December 2019.  On January 16, 2020, the President issued a major disaster declaration,  making available public and individual assistance  to address damage on the island.  To  date, FEMA has  provided $54 million for earthquake response efforts.  The current  balance in FEMA\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund is $43 billion, demonstrating the  presence of  substantial available resources.   In addition, FEMA has provided more than $1.4 million in  direct financial assistance to individuals and families in Puerto Rico to help them recover  from the recent earthquakes.   The Department of  Transportation has also provided another  $5 million in quick-release Emergency Relief highway funds  to meet immediate  infrastructure recovery needs     During the initial earthquake response, at the request of the Government of Puerto Rico, FEMA provided nearly 1.1 million liters of water,  5,000 cots,  and nearly 163,000 meals to fulfill commodity  requests from the affected municipalities and  to help survivors recover.  FEMA also provided 20 tanker trucks to transport  water, also  at the request of the Commonwealth.   However, neither Puerto Ricans nor  the American  taxpayers benefit when  emergency  aid  is misallocated, lost, or stolen  through waste, fraud,  and abuse.  Puerto Rico has a long  history of inadequate  financial controls over regular  government operations, which forced the Congress to appoint a financial control board in 2016.  Multiple high-profile cases of  corruption have marred distribution of aid already  appropriated and have led to ongoing  political instability on the island.     This  misguided  bill would add $4.7  billion on top of  all of the billions  already  allocated  to Puerto Rico, and its restrictive provisions  would prevent the Administration from ensuring  these  funds are well-spent.   Additionally, the  creation  of in excess  of $15  billion in  new  Federal subsidies through the tax code would add billions of dollars to the deficit and undermine efforts to put the  Commonwealth on a  path to sustained economic growth and fiscal self-sufficiency.   If  H.R. 5687  were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1373, the Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act.  This bill would permanently make more than 1 million acres of Federal lands in Arizona off limits to development and uses that would otherwise be permissible under Federal laws governing public lands, mining, mineral, and geothermal leasing.  The Administration opposes such a large, permanent withdrawal, which would prohibit environmentally responsible development, as determined through site-specific analysis, of uranium and other mineral resources. The United States has an extraordinary abundance of mineral resources, both onshore and offshore, but this legislation would restrict our ability to access critical minerals like uranium in an area known to have them in large supply.  Moreover, the size of the withdrawal included in H.R. 1373 is inconsistent with the Administration\u2019s goal of striking the appropriate balance for use of public lands described in two executive orders.  This withdrawal would conflict with the objectives set forth in Executive Order 13783, Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth, and Executive Order 13817, A Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals.  Development of our Nation\u2019s mineral resources is essential to ensuring the Nation\u2019s geopolitical security, and this bill would not help us achieve that goal.  If H.R. 1373 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. * * * * * * * ", "The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 3055, making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies, and the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2020 and for other purposes.  The Administration is strongly opposed to the budgetary framework that underlies this and other appropriations bills being considered by the House of Representatives.  This framework would raise the discretionary spending caps by more than $350 billion in fiscal years (FY) 2020 and 2021 and does not reflect either a House-passed budget resolution or a bipartisan, bicameral agreement.  It would put the Federal Government on track to add nearly $2 trillion to deficits over 10 years, adding significantly to the national debt, which is already more than $22 trillion and rising.   In addition, the House Democrats\u2019 framework continues to adhere to the misguided and unfounded notion that increases to defense spending must be matched or exceeded by increases to non-defense spending.  In fact, the appropriations bills under consideration would provide more than twice as much additional funding in FY 2020 for non-defense programs as for defense programs, relative to FY 2019 levels.  Investing in our national security remains a key Administration priority, but strengthening our defense does not require additional non-defense discretionary spending.  Overall, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would appropriate $321.9 billion, $25.7 billion, or 8.7 percent, above the FY 2020 Budget request and $29.8 billion above the FY 2019 enacted level.  In addition, this legislation includes a number of particularly problematic provisions implicating key Administration priorities, including provisions that would prohibit the use of FY 2020 or prior-year military construction funding to design, construct, or carry out projects along the southern border; preclude the use of appropriated funds to implement the 2020 Decennial Census questions as submitted to the Congress in March 2018; and prevent the Administration from finalizing key rules at the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. If H.R. 3055 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the bill. Division A\u2014Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020 Department of Commerce (DOC) Trade Enforcement. The Administration appreciates the support the bill provides for DOC\u2019s International Trade Administration and Bureau of Industry and Security trade enforcement programs.  These programs are key parts of the Administration\u2019s efforts to address unfair trade practices impacting United States businesses and national security. Census Bureau. While the Administration is committed to a fair, modern, and accurate 2020 Decennial Census, the bill provides $1.6 billion more than what is needed for Census\u2019s Periodic Programs and Censuses account to support all planned preparation, scale up, and operations anticipated in 2020.  In addition, the bill proposes to adjust the non-defense discretionary caps by $7.5 billion to accommodate the costs of the Decennial Census.  The Administration opposes this adjustment as the Decennial Census is neither unanticipated nor an emergency, which is the criteria for other discretionary cap adjustments.  The Administration also strongly opposes language in section 534 of the bill that would preclude the use of appropriated funds to implement the 2020 Decennial Census questions as submitted to the Congress in March 2018. DOC Departmental Management.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not adopt the Administration\u2019s proposal to elevate and expand the Office of Space Commerce.  Failing to adopt the FY 2020 Budget request to improve space traffic management and situational awareness would weaken the ability of commercial satellites to safely operate in a congested space environment. DOC Program Eliminations and Savings. The Administration is disappointed the bill continues to fund DOC bureaus and programs proposed for elimination in the FY 2020 Budget request, including the Economic Development Administration, and Sea Grant.  The Administration urges the Congress to discontinue funding for these duplicative, unauthorized, and lower priority programs. Department of Justice (DOJ) Federal Law Enforcement. The Administration appreciates the $15.7 billion provided for DOJ\u2019s Federal law enforcement components.  These resources would support ongoing efforts to address counterterrorism, the opioid crisis, and violent crime.  Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided to address the pending caseload by enhancing the efficacy and efficiency of EOIR\u2019s immigration adjudication programs.  However, the Administration objects to section 218 of the bill which would prohibit EOIR from incorporating case completion metrics into individual performance evaluations for immigration judges.  The Administration believes that setting case completion goals for Immigration Judges is one important tool to address the system\u2019s unacceptable backlog and efficiently manage the docket overall. 2  Legal Representation Funding. The Administration opposes the establishment of an Immigration Representation Pilot grant program.  Such a program may be inconsistent with the policy directive in section 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act that aliens in removal hearings are not entitled to Government-funded representation. Combating the Opioid Crisis. The Administration greatly appreciates the resources provided to address the opioid epidemic, including the $2.8 billion provided for the Drug Enforcement Administration and the $375 million provided for Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act grants.  These resources would help to address the opioid crisis in communities across the Nation. First Step Act. The Administration appreciates that the bill provides $75 million, the authorized level of funding, to support the historic First Step Act of 2018.  The Act puts into place commonsense reforms to make our justice system fairer and help inmates successfully transition back into society. The Administration is committed to fully implementing the Act and would utilize this funding to expand inmate access to evidence-based, recidivism-reducing programs. Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN).  The Administration is disappointed that the bill fails to provide funding for the PSN program.  PSN brings together law enforcement and their communities to develop effective, locally-based strategies to reduce violent crime.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure the necessary funding is in place to fully support efforts to create safer neighborhoods through sustained reductions in violent crime. Federal Prisoner Detention. The Administration strongly urges the Congress to fully fund the Federal Prisoner Detention account at the level included in the FY 2020 Budget request.  The U.S.Marshals Service (USMS) pre-trial detainee population has increased significantly since April 2017 due to enhanced enforcement of immigration, weapons, and drug offenses.  While the USMS has identified and is in the process of implementing cost saving measures in response to the population increases, additional funds are required to adequately support current and anticipated population increases. Bureau of Prisons. The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not cancel funding for an unnecessary prison project in Letcher County, Kentucky, as proposed by the FY 2020 Budget request.  After years of declining inmate populations nationwide, it is wasteful to pursue a facility that is estimated to cost the taxpayers more than $500 million and continues to be plagued by delays and cost overruns. Sanctuary Jurisdictions. The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the amendments requested in section 217 of the DOJ general provisions of the FY 2020 Budget.  These amendments would clarify that Federal, State, and local governments must comply with immigration detainer requests and authorizes the Department of Homeland Security and DOJ to condition financial assistance on cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement activities and requests. Firearm Protections. The Administration is concerned that the bill excludes certain second amendment related protections that have been included in prior appropriations acts, such as those 3  related to the import and export of certain firearms.  The Administration urges the Congress to include these provisions. Crime Victims Fund (CVF). The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not adopt the FY 2020 Budget request proposal to eliminate the use of the CVF change in a mandatory program\u2014or CHIMP.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reform the CVF to eliminate this budget gimmick, limit receipts deposited into the fund, and to provide predictable and sufficient funding for crime victims and victim services. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) NASA Exploration Research and Development.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s investments in NASA.  However, the Administration is disappointed that the bill provides far less funding than is needed to support the Administration\u2019s goal of a near-term human lunar landing.  Instead, the bill diverts funding to support lower-priority activities within the Agency. The Administration strongly urges the Congress to redirect this funding to allow the United States to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024 as an important step on our way to Mars. National Science Foundation (NSF) NSF Topline. The Administration is concerned that the bill funds NSF at $1.6 billion above the level in the FY 2020 Budget request.  This unrequested funding undermines the Administration\u2019s efforts to rein in non-defense discretionary funding. Legal Services Corporation (LSC) LSC Topline.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not eliminate Federal funding for LSC, which would save the American taxpayer more than $400 million per year.  The Administration seeks to end the one-size-fits-all model of providing legal services through a single grant program by putting more control in the hands of State and local governments which better understand the needs of their communities. Division B\u2014Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  The Administration appreciates the $6 billion funding level provided by the bill for the WIC program, which includes an $800 million rescission of unobligated balances.  This level is sufficient to serve all projected eligible participants. Agriculture Building and Facilities. The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for USDA facilities including modernization and implementation of USDA\u2019s OneNeighborhood Initiative in the National Capital Region.  The bill provides $331 million consistent with the FY 2020 Budget request. 4  Public Law 480 Title II Food Aid (Title II).  The Administration opposes providing food aid funding through use of Title II and prefers providing all food aid through the International Humanitarian Assistance account, as proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request, which consolidates overseas humanitarian assistance programs and funding of the Department of State and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  While the United States is the world\u2019s largest donor of food aid, taxpayers expect such aid to be provided in the most cost-effective manner possible.  Title II is cost-inefficient, slow, and limits USAID\u2019s ability to use the most appropriate food aid intervention for a particular crisis. McGovern Dole International Food for Education.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides $235 million in funding for the McGovern Dole International Food for Education program, which has been proposed for elimination in every budget request since FY 2018.  McGovern-Dole has unaddressed oversight and performance monitoring challenges and is duplicative of USAID programs.  Agriculture Research Agency Relocation.  The Administration opposes language in the bill that would prohibit funding that is appropriated to the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to be used to relocate ERS or NIFA outside the National Capital Region, including language under the ERS and NIFA headings and in sections 755, 758, and 759.  Relocation of ERS and NIFA would bring Federal resources closer to the stakeholders which USDA serves. The relocation would improve USDA\u2019s ability to attract and retain highly qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture, many of whom come from the land-grant universities dispersed across rural America. Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers. The Administration opposes section 780 of that bill that would prevent funds from being used to alter the USDA role in the Job Corps program in any manner.  The Administration is pursuing reforms to Job Corps that would allow the USDA Forest Service to better focus on its core natural resource mission and unify program responsibility at the Department of Labor, which would improve efficiency for the disadvantaged youth the program serves.  In contrast, section 780 would ensure that funds continue to be spent on low performing Job Corps centers that are failing to meet the needs of students and wasting taxpayer funds. New Swine Slaughter Inspection System Rule. The Administration opposes section 779 of the bill that would prohibit USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service from implementing a proposal to modernize the inspection of hog slaughter plants until the Office of the Inspector General reviews the data used to develop the proposed rule.  Commodity Credit Corporation. The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not include language requested in the FY 2020 Budget that would allow USDA to use the Commodity Credit Corporation\u2019s third quarter financial statement to provide an interim reimbursement of net realized losses prior to the completion of the FY 2019 financial statement.  Rural Broadband Pilot Program. The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for this high priority program that would provide vital broadband infrastructure for rural America.  USDA is working to implement the initial $1.2 billion enacted in FYs 2018 and 2019, most of which is unobligated.  The bill provides an additional $550 million for the rural broadband pilot, while the 5  FY 2020 Budget only requested an additional $200 million which the Administration believes is sufficient given the availability of prior year funding.  Rural Housing Loans and Grants. The Administration is disappointed that the bill misses an opportunity to fund mortgage lending in a way that utilizes the private banking industry to provide home loans, through USDA\u2019s single family housing loan guarantee program, as the more efficient way to deliver this assistance.  In total, the bill provides $1.7 billion for the USDA\u2019s housing programs, which is $312 million above the FY 2020 Budget request.  The bill diverges from the priorities in the FY 2020 Budget request by funding the direct housing loans and grants program at historical levels. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  The Administration opposes the $167 million in unrequested funding provided in the bill for the small, private watershed infrastructure and rehabilitation efforts administered NRCS.  While many of these watershed projects were initially constructed with Federal funding, maintenance and rehabilitation of these projects are more appropriately the responsibility of local entities.  Rural Business\u2014Cooperative Service.  The Administration proposes to eliminate Rural Business Cooperative Service grant programs in the FY 2020 Budget request. These grant programs have failed to meet goals and are duplicative of private sector assistance.  The bill provides $119 million, $98 million above the FY 2020 Budget request.  Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides excessive funding for the AMS without adopting the savings proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request.  The bill provides $68 million above the FY 2020 Budget request for AMS, including unrequested funding for the National Organic Program.  USDA Research Programs. The bill provides $3.3 billion for research programs, $425 million above the FY 2020 Budget request. The FY 2020 Budget request targeted research to competitive grant programs while supporting primary research and reducing lower priority duplicative research areas. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) FDA.  The Administration appreciates additional funding provided in the bill to a number of key medical product safety and food safety initiatives, including increases as requested in the FY 2020 Budget to strengthen safety of the Nation\u2019s blood supply, compounded drugs, and to improve medical countermeasure development.  The bill also includes requested increases to advance FDA\u2019s efforts to promote innovation and food safety.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee adopted an amendment to restore section 778 of the bill, to protect human embryos by prohibiting FDA from accepting and reviewing any applications involving human embryos that have been intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification, and strongly urges the Congress to retain this provision in the final bill. 6  Division C\u2014Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020 Department of the Interior (DOI) DOI Topline. The Administration is concerned that the bill would provide $13.8 billion for DOI, which is $2.4 billion above the FY 2020 Budget request. DOI Reorganization. The Administration is concerned that the bill provides no funding to support the reorganization of DOI, an initiative focused on making DOI more efficient and responsive to the public.  The Administration strongly opposes efforts to block these important and bold reforms. Objectionable Energy Language Provisions. The Administration strongly opposes provisions that would block authorized activities that promote America\u2019s energy security.  This includes language in section 117 of the bill that would effectively prohibit pre-leasing and other activities in certain areas of the Outer Continental Shelf, and language in section 118 of the bill that would impose arbitrary criteria prior to conducting authorized lease sales in Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. DOI and USDA, Forest Service Federal Land Acquisition. The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides $216 million above the FY 2020 Budget request for Federal Land Acquisition.  Adding land to the Federal estate is a lower priority because USDA and DOI already manage roughly 700 million acres of land and the focus should be on addressing the backlog on deferred maintenance.  Forest and Hazardous Fuels Management.  The Administration appreciates the hazardous fuels funds provided in the bill to support forest landscape management priorities across both departments. Providing the full requested level of $644 million would allow the agencies to reduce wildfire risk by treating more areas. USDA, Forest Service USDA Forest Service Topline.  The Administration appreciates the increased transparency of the revised budget structure reflected in the bill.  However, the Administration is concerned that the bill would provide $3.7 billion for non-wildfire activities at the Forest Service, which is $891 million above the FY 2020 Budget request. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) EPA Topline. The Administration is concerned that the bill would provide $9.5 billion for EPA, which is $3.3 billion above the FY 2020 Budget request.  The bill provides significant funding for additional activities and programs that go beyond EPA\u2019s core statutory and regulatory requirements to protect air, land, and water resources, and ensure the safety of chemicals. 7  Environmental Grants.  The Administration continues to recommend reductions to EPA\u2019s State and Tribal Assistance Grants account, which the bill would fund at $2 billion above the FY 2020 Budget Request.  Within this account, the bill provides significant unrequested funding, including support for categorical grants and activities that may go beyond statutory mandates. EPA\u2019s Science and Technology Account. The Administration continues to recommend reductions to the Science and Technology account, which is funded at $301 million above the FY 2020 Budget request.  Reductions to this account would reduce extramural Federal funding for environmental research and development activities that would more appropriately be funded and conducted by entities outside of the Federal Government. Other Independent Agencies National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (Wilson Center).  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not eliminate or reduce Federal funding for NEA, NEH, and Wilson Center as proposed in the FY 2020 Budget request.  The Administration recognizes the positive effects the arts and humanities have on our communities; however the FY 2020 Budget request proposed an orderly phase-out of Federal funding for these agencies, as the Administration does not consider their activities to be core Federal responsibilities. Division D\u2014Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020 Department of Defense (DOD) Border Security Funding and Authority. The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s lack of funding for DOD\u2019s border-related military construction requirements and prohibition on the use of FY 2020 or prior-year military construction funding to design, construct, or carry out projects along the southern border.  The security and humanitarian crisis at the border is a national emergency, and this funding is vital to build the border barriers needed to help secure and manage the southern border.  Hurricane Relief. The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support to fund the replacement or reconstruction of facilities damaged beyond repair by Hurricanes Florence and Michael and also by significant flooding in Nebraska. Reprioritization of Military Construction Funding to Unrequested Projects.  The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s realignment of military construction funding from priority projects to other projects not included the FY 2020 Budget request.  Contrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible policy to fully fund projects, the bill proposes to incrementally fund 20 military construction projects, effectively creating an unfunded obligation of $1.4 billion needed to fully fund these projects over time.  In addition, the bill diverts $1 billion requested in the FY 2020 Budget to fully fund priority projects, or from rescissions of prior year funds, to other unrequested projects. 8  Reprogramming Guidelines. The Administration strongly objects to the one percent reprogramming threshold for military construction and family housing projects. This limitation significantly hinders the ability to reprogram funds without prior congressional notice and would subsequently have negative consequences on the timely execution of many projects, which could lead to unnecessary cost increases.  Market conditions are changing steadily due to recent events such as hurricanes resulting in increased labor and material costs.  The Department would have virtually no flexibility to manage and execute the military construction and family housing programs since a one percent increase would equate to $550,000, based on the average cost of an FY 2020 construction project, which is $55 million. Detention Facilities at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s lack of funding for the high-value detention facility replacement at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Discretionary Funding and VA MISSION Act of 2018. The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s robust funding level of $94.3 billion in discretionary appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  This level fully supports the Administration\u2019s highest priorities for veterans\u2019 programs, including implementation of the VA MISSION Act of 2018.   However, the Administration understands that the House Majority would like to provide funding related to the VA MISSION Act of 2018 outside of the statutory non-defense discretionary spending cap, which the Administration would strongly oppose.  All funding for the VA MISSION Act of 2018 should be included within the FY 2020 non-defense discretionary cap. Division E\u2014Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020 Department of Transportation (DOT) Capital Investment Grants (CIG). The Administration opposes policy provisions, as well as overly prescriptive administrative provisions, that contravene the current law, regulations, and guidance of the CIG program.  The Administration believes that funding allocations should be made based on defined criteria and that the directives in the bill that affect local cost share, contingency funding requirements, and pre-determination of project award selection would cause taxpayers to assume more risk for complicated, multiyear projects. Amtrak.  The Administration is disappointed the bill continues the status quo, providing $2 billion for all Amtrak operations, including its highly inefficient long-distance trains.  The Administration believes that there is a real opportunity to reform and improve Amtrak service across the United States.  The FY 2020 Budget request would leverage the Restoration and Enhancements grant program to begin a collaborative process with stakeholders to undertake a multi-year process to restructure the network, which has not markedly changed in over 40 years.  DOT Rulemaking Prohibitions. The Administration strongly objects to provisions prohibiting DOT from finalizing vital regulations, particularly section 145 of the bill, which would prohibit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) from finalizing or enforcing the 9  Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule which has the potential to save more than 12,700 lives and save society more than $250 billion.  In addition, the Administration strongly objects to efforts to limit DOT from finalizing and enforcing hours of service regulations to ensure the safe and efficient operation of commercial vehicles on the Nation\u2019s roads. California High Speed Rail. The Administration objects to section 192 of the bill that would prohibit DOT from terminating, de-obligating, and requiring repayment of expended funding under grant agreements with the California High Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA) in effect on the date of enactment of the act.  The responsibility for grant oversight and management should remain with DOT, including any potential resulting action the Department may need to take as steward of Federal funds in its review of CHSRA\u2019s grant agreement for $2.5 billion in funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Essential Air Service (EAS). The Administration is disappointed that the bill did not include the Administration\u2019s FY 2020 Budget proposals to reform the EAS program at DOT.  The Administration believes that common-sense, modest reforms can be implemented to control costs, while ensuring that truly remote communities receive air service. Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) Non-Federal Project Share. The Administration opposes language in the bill that could eliminate the requirement for TIFIA-supported projects to be funded at least 20 percent by non-Federal assistance.  The language could impede TIFIA\u2019s effectiveness in leveraging Federal resources to generate non-Federal investment, and could increase the default risk of projects.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Rental Assistance Programs.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides $45.1 billion, $7.1 billion above the FY 2020 Budget request, for HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs.  The bill continues to reflect the status quo and does not adopt the FY 2020 Budget\u2019s proposed legislative reforms to Housing Choice Vouchers, Project-Based Rental Assistance, Public Housing, and Housing for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities.  The Administration\u2019s proposal includes uniform work requirements, as well as offers public housing authorities, private property owners, and HUD-assisted families a simpler and more transparent set of rent structures to reduce administrative burden, incentivize work, and place HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs on a more fiscally sustainable path. Proposed Grant Eliminations. The Administration opposes the $3.6 billion provided in the bill for the Community Development Block Grant program, as the program is not well-targeted to the most distressed areas and has not demonstrated measurable impacts on communities.  The Administration also opposes the $1.8 billion provided in the bill for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program because State and local governments can more effectively address the unique market challenges, local regulations, and impediments that lead to housing affordability problems for households across the Nation.  In addition, the Administration opposes the $300 million provided in this bill for Choice Neighborhoods since State and local governments are better positioned than the Choice Neighborhoods program to fund locally driven strategies for neighborhood revitalization.  In total, these eliminations would save $5.7 billion in FY 2020, which could be directed to higher priority needs.  10  HUD Rulemaking Prohibitions. The Administration objects to section 234 of the bill that would prevent HUD from proceeding with the proposed rule to align HUD\u2019s regulations for housing assistance to current law, which prohibits persons other than United States citizens and other eligible noncitizens from receiving HUD rental assistance.  Section 236 of the bill would also prevent HUD from proceeding with the proposed rule to allow grantees participating in programs which permit single-sex facilities to have greater flexibility in establishing their own policies, consistent with State and local laws.  In addition, section 237 of the bill would statutorily codify an outdated guidance notice on this subject.  The Administration opposes such provisions as they would impede the Administration\u2019s rulemaking process and authority.  Division F\u2014Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act of 2019 The Administration opposes division F of the bill, which provides back pay for contractors during a lapse in appropriations. While contractors play an important role in helping Government agencies meet their missions, this legislation ignores important principles of Federal contracting, and would lead to increased cost and a significant increase in the risk of fraud, waste, and improper payment. The Administration anticipates significant, disruptive, and costly challenges in trying to force-fit the requirements of contractor back-pay legislation into an acquisition system that is not designed or equipped to manage contractor employees, making it difficult, if not impossible, to meet the dual goals of paying quickly and paying accurately. Constitutional Concerns Certain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, certain provisions would interfere with the President\u2019s constitutional authority and duty to protect national security, as well as his authority as Commander in Chief. Another provision would violate the Recommendations Clause of the Constitution while other provisions would intrude upon the President\u2019s constitutional authority over international diplomacy.  Other provisions would contravene the constitutional separation of powers between the Executive Branch and the Congress, and another could infringe on the President\u2019s constitutional authority to control the disclosure of information that is subject to executive privilege. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2020 appropriations process moves forward. * * * * * * * 11  ", "The Administration opposes  H.R. 2546.  This bill  would impose unnecessary and harmful  restrictions on more than 2.5 million acres of land in Colorado, California, and Washington State, including nearly 1.5  million acres in the form  of  wilderness designations.  These  restrictions  will greatly reduce opportunities for  multiple  uses on these public lands, limit access  to them, and significantly reduce the  available productive acreage  in working forests, rendering them  more prone to catastrophic  wildfires.    The Administration has expanded  access to America\u2019s public lands;  increased hunting, fishing, and recreational opportunities nationwide; and enhanced conservation stewardship  of our  vast  natural resources.  With regard to the designation of  wilderness on public lands, the  Administration  generally supports  congressional action  to  resolve  wilderness designation and Wilderness Study Areas  (WSA) release issues, particularly for  WSAs  that were established  more  than 30 years ago.  Many WSAs  were  recommended for designation, while others  were  recommended as not  suitable, with suggestions  that they be returned to agency  management to  integrate their other intrinsic values  into surrounding land management plans.  The  Administration recommends  addressing these long overdue WSA decisions before undertaking potential designations  of  new areas that did not meet the  criteria  established in the  1964 Wilderness Act  when inventories were completed  many  years ago.   The Administration strongly believes  that before  new  or potential wilderness  areas or  wild and scenic rivers  are designated, it  is  important to first ensure that  such designation  is  the most appropriate land management tool  for a given parcel.  For this  and other reasons, successful  conservation proposals  that have incorporated this  tool over the last decade have been more limited  in geographic scope  than this  bill.  It is important to ensure that designating new  wilderness  areas on public lands does not unnecessarily impede public  access, limit  outdoor  recreational opportunities, or conflict with pre-existing uses.   Unfortunately, a number  of the  proposals for  wilderness  designations in H.R. 2546 fail to follow this successful model.  While many recreational  activities, such as hunting, fishing, and hiking, are compatible with  wilderness designation, other  activities, such as mountain biking and off-highway  vehicle use, are not.  Some  of the areas proposed for  wilderness designation in H.R. 2546 contain popular  motorized or  mechanized recreation areas.  In addition, existing energy development poses  inherent challenges for  wilderness designations, creating complex  management issues pertaining to active mining claims and oil and gas leases within a designated wilderness  area.  The  designations under this  bill could impede future  energy and mineral development, including  development that is important  to the economic and national  security  of the United States.  The Administration is  committed to  managing public lands  as a good neighbor to the local  communities  and to the  Americans who live and work in close proximity to them.  Engaging local  stakeholders and  considering their on-the-ground expertise  are  critical steps in making decisions about public lands management, and local  communities have concerns that  many aspects  of  H.R. 2546  would produce negative effects  for their  citizens and their economies.  The Administration is willing to  work  with Congress to  make the necessary  improvements to this  bill if it is  considered further.  If H.R.  2546  were presented to the President  in its current form,  however, his advisors  would recommend that he veto it.    * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly opposes S.J. Res. 54.  This resolution would undermine the Administration\u2019s ability to respond effectively to the ongoing crisis at the Southern Border by terminating the national emergency the President declared on February 15, 2019.  The Southern Border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics, and the crisis threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency. In addition, security challenges at the Southern Border exacerbate an ongoing humanitarian crisis that threatens the well-being of vulnerable populations, including women and children.  While the Administration has made great strides in tightening border security with the use of available statutory authorities, countering large-scale unlawful migration and humanitarian challenges across the Southern Border requires continued vigilance and the dedication of available Federal resources.  The President\u2019s emergency declaration invokes the same authority that President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama used to undertake more than 18 different military construction projects between 2001 and 2013.  When President Trump declared the national emergency on the Southern Border in February 2019, it marked the sixtieth time a President has used this authority since the enactment of the National Emergencies Act of 1976. Since the President\u2019s declaration, the situation on the border has improved, and S.J. Res. 54 would hinder the progress that is being made.  The Congress has acted in an overwhelmingly bipartisan manner to approve the provision of emergency resources to address the crisis, and the Congress has agreed to a budget framework that expressly preserves the authorities the Administration is using to address the crisis.  Congress should not vote to terminate the national emergency and remove important border security and humanitarian tools from the Government\u2019s toolkit.  As the Administration continues to use its national emergency authorities to address the crisis on the border, its Fiscal Year 2020 budget request calls on the Congress to ensure sufficient funding is provided to ensure these emergency measures do not delay other important investments across the Government. On March 15, 2019, the President vetoed an identical resolution that would have terminated  the national emergency.  If S.J. Res. 54 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it as well. ** * * * * *  ", "The Administration appreciates the work of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  on H.R. 7575, the Water Resources  Development Act of 2020.  H.R. 7575  would advance some of the Administration\u2019s policies and principles,  including building a foundation for long-term economic growth, addressing significant risks to public safety, and protecting our environment.   The bill, however,  could be improved.  The Administration  looks forward to working  with Congress to modify or remove certain provisions and to include others so that  this important legislation can achieve its full potential.    H.R. 7575  would authorize 38  new construction projects,  at a total cost of  more than  $10 billion,  and  41  new studies.   Given the large number of previously authorized projects that have not been started or completed, the priority for new project and study authorizations should go to  those  that would most likely produce  high economic or environmental returns to the Nation and  to those  most likely to address significant  risks  to public safety within one of the three main mission areas of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps):  flood and storm damage reduction,  commercial  navigation,  and aquatic  ecosystem restoration.    The Administration appreciates  the  inclusion of section 137,  which would extend section 1043 (b) of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, as amended, to September 30, 2026.  This authority, which allows the Corps to transfer Federal appropriations to a  non-Federal sponsor  for construction of  projects, is an important tool for improving how the Nation invests in and manages our water  resources.  It  helps accelerate the construction of infrastructure projects, generate cost efficiencies, and empower States and local communities to achieve their priorities. The Administration also supports the goal of section 301, which would establish a process to identify for deauthorization projects that no longer meet the Nation\u2019s needs.  The Administration,  however,  has concerns that similar provisions in previous  legislation  have not resulted in substantial deauthorizations  and believes the bill should be strengthened to ensure projects are actually deauthorized.   The Administration  objects to  section 108, which would reduce the users\u2019  share of the cost of capital projects on the inland waterways from  50  percent to 35  percent.  The Administration believes the users\u2019  share of these  investments should continue to be 50  percent.  The Corps has  previously  estimated that the annual receipts from the existing diesel fuel tax cover less than 10  percent of the total cost that the Corps incurs  to support commercial navigation on these waterways, after accounting for infrastructure  operation and maintenance costs, which are  currently borne by taxpayers.   Reducing the users\u2019 share of the cost of capital projects would  result in the taxpayer paying for nearly all of the cost that the Corps incurs to support commercial  navigation on the inland waterways.  The Administration believes beneficiaries  should pay their fair share.   The Administration encourages Congress to enact additional reforms that would improve the  Nation\u2019s management of water resources.  These include, for example,  an annual per-vessel fee that would increase  the amount paid by commercial navigation users of the inland waterways.  This fee would support economic growth, help cover the expected future construction and operating requirements of the inland waterways, and more accurately reflect actual  costs incurred  by the Corps on behalf of commercial users.  The current excise tax on diesel fuel used in commerce  in inland waterways  will  not produce the revenue needed to cover these costs.     The Administration also objects to section 134 of  the bill.   This provision would require the Secretary of the Army to identify levee deficiencies, recommend repairs, and develop cost estimates for those  repairs  for up to roughly 9,000 levee systems without specifying the appropriate  cost share  for all of this work.   This work is now mostly the responsibility of levee owners.   If the bill were to require the work to be undertaken by the Federal Government, it  would  undermine efforts to build up the capability of States to develop and run their own levee programs.  In many cases, it also could result  in  slower  repair times, which would increase flood risks.   The Administration is concerned that sections 140 and 330 of the bill could result in the forgiveness of debt owed to the Federal Government for the non-Federal cost share of the construction of certain projects. While restructuring debt may be appropriate in some circumstances, the administration is  concerned that these provisions, as written, are overly broad  and could result in significant losses of funds owed to the Treasury.     The Administration supports the goal of section 142, but has some concerns with the provision as drafted.  The Administration has worked hard to ensure critical components of infrastructure projects comply with \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions that already exist  in current  law.  Further, through Executive Order  13881, the Administration has tightened the domestic content standards required under the Buy American Act for a company to receive a preference in a Federal procurement, including a requirement that iron or  steel must have 95% domestic content to be considered American-made.  The Administration believes Buy American  provisions are in the best interests of Americans and American companies and would like to work with Congress to strengthen the statutory Buy American  policy, while avoiding  schedule delays and unreasonable increases  in construction costs.     Finally, the Administration encourages Congress to authorize  the Corps to divest of the Washington Aqueduct, which is  the only local water  supply system in the Nation owned and operated by the Corps.  The Administration believes that water supplies should be owned by  State or local governments, or  private sector  entities,  which are disciplined by appropriate  regulatory and market incentives.   The Administration remains committed to working with the Congress  to improve  this legislation and address the Nation\u2019s water resources challenges.   ", "The Administration opposes H.J.  Res. 90, a disapproval resolution under the Congressional Review Act of the final rule on Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Regulations  adopted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  The Administration is dedicated to the  promotion of lending, investment, and enhanced economic activity in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods across our country, and this final rule is a reflection of that dedication.  The regulations  that the House seeks to overturn, in coordination with the Opportunity Zones program,  are a critical step in ensuring prosperity for all Americans, and the final rule increases  support for and investment in  small businesses, small- and family-owned farms, Indian Country, and distressed communities.  Unfortunately, H.J. Res. 90 does not recognize the important work that has been completed to develop a final rule that helps Americans all  over the  Nation.  The  final rule takes important steps to strengthen the CRA regulatory framework for OCC-regulated institutions by clarifying and bringing certainty to what qualifies for CRA consideration.  It  also strengthens the regulatory framework  by  evaluating bank CRA performance more objectively, updating how banks define their assessment areas, and making the entire process  of bank efforts to fulfill the CRA\u2019s goals  more transparent and efficient.  Additionally, the final  rule\u2019s framework  is readily applicable  to  banks  of all sizes and business  models.  The final rule also incentivizes banks to achieve specific performance goals for lending.  As a result, the Administration disagrees with the Resolution\u2019s  premise  that the OCC\u2019s CRA regulations weaken requirements to lend to low-income borrowers and communities.  Instead, the Administration is confident that these incentives will lead to an increase in lending to these borrowers and communities  and an overall increase in total  lending.  The incentives provided by the final  rule represent a  substantial  improvement from  the previous rule, under which  a bank\u2019s  performance was rated on ambiguous, often subjective review criteria.    Overall, the  rule is the culmination of more than a decade of dialogue about improving how the CRA works.  Stakeholders submitted more than 7,500 comments on the regulations at the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  stage, and the final rule incorporates  many of their suggestions.  The Administration is confident that this rule will help small businesses and other entities, improve  how the CRA works, and lead to an increase in total  lending.   If H.J.  Res. 90 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that  he veto the disapproval resolution.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly supports H.R. 5430, which approves and implements the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The Agreement was  recently  signed by  all three countries and will replace the 25-year-old North American  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with  a 21st century, high-standard agreement that rebalances trade in North America and modernizes  these important trading relationships. This historic and modern  Agreement will be the template for  all future United States trade agreements. After  a year of  advocacy across the country from  thousands of businesses, grassroots campaigns,  and elected officials, the Agreement  passed the  House  overwhelmingly last month. One of President Trump\u2019s principal objectives when negotiating  a new deal with Canada and Mexico to replace NAFTA was to ensure that the new Agreement benefits American workers.  The Agreement\u2019s rules of origin for  automotive goods secure this outcome by imposing a labor value  content rule requiring  at least 40-45 percent of  auto content be produced at  plants or facilities with an average wage of at least $16 per hour, in addition to increasing the regional content of the  vehicles to 75 percent.  The Agreement also benefits American  farmers, ranchers,  and agribusinesses by  expanding  opportunities for exports of American products. It  does so by increasing market access into  Canada for  American dairy, poultry, and eggs; enhancing information exchange  and cooperation regarding  agricultural biotechnology trade-related matters; and improving transparency and cooperation to ensure non-discriminatory treatment for agricultural product standards.  The Agreement also provides strong  and effective  protection and enforcement of intellectual  property rights critical to driving innovation, creating economic  growth, and supporting American jobs. In addition, the Agreement\u2019s digital trade provisions provide a firm foundation for the  expansion of trade and investment in the innovative products and services  where the  United States  has a competitive advantage.  Additionally, the Agreement includes commitments to liberalize financial services markets and  facilitate a level playing field for United States financial institutions and enhance  cross-border trade in financial services, while preserving the discretion of regulators to  protect financial stability.  For the  first time in a  United States trade agreement, the USMCA includes a dedicated  chapter on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which complements other key provisions  supporting small and medium-sized businesses throughout the  Agreement.   Further, the Agreement includes a chapter on currency that targets competitive devaluations and includes strong transparency provisions that are  enforceable through dispute settlement. It  also strengthens protections against unfair trading practices by state-owned enterprises.   The USMCA is a historic trade agreement that presents a tremendous opportunity  for all three  countries by  greatly improving the outdated NAFTA. It substantially enhances protections for  workers  and the environment and includes strong new mechanisms to  ensure those provisions are  enforced. It opens markets to United States manufacturers and farmers  and reduces trade barriers, thereby creating freer markets, fairer trade, and robust economic growth throughout  all of North America.   If H.R. 5430 were presented to the President in its current form, he would sign the bill.   * * * * * * *                                           2   ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 38, a joint resolution disapproving the issuance of an export license for the proposed transfer of defense articles, defense services, and technical data to support the manufacture of the Aurora Fuzing System for the Paveway IV Precision Guided Bomb Program in regards to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The transfer of Paveway precision-guided capability to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia directly supports the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a friendly country that continues to be an important force for political and economic stability in the Middle East. Apart from negatively affecting our bilateral relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the joint resolution would hamper our ability to sustain and shape critical security cooperation activities and would significantly hinder the interoperability between our nations. Additionally, the joint resolution would impact our partner\u2019s ability to deter and defend against Iranian military aggression. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia serves as a bulwark against Iran and its proxies\u2019 malign activities in the region. Its civilians and the thousands of United States citizens residing in Saudi Arabia continue to be threatened by attacks from the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, and suffered an attack last month that injured 26 civilians. S.J. Res. 38 would send a message that the United States is abandoning its partners and allies at the very moment when threats to them are increasing. The United States has taken a number of actions to help the Saudi military mitigate the risk of civilian casualties in Yemen, including training and advising the Saudi military to help them improve their targeting processes to minimize civilian casualties. Combined with this assistance, the provision of precision-guided munitions would further help the Saudis mitigate the risk of civilian casualties. In addition to the joint resolution\u2019s adverse effects on our Middle East partner, it would also negatively affect our NATO Allies and the transatlantic defense industry. Actions such as these could, without further examination, have unintended consequences for defense procurement and interoperability with our partners, and could create an opportunity for exploitation by our adversaries.  If the President were presented with S.J. Res. 38, his advisors would recommend he veto it. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly opposes passage of H.R. 8015. Instead of reforming the United States Postal Service (USPS)  to ensure its  continued viability in the modern economy, H.R. 8015 would arbitrarily give USPS  $25 billion in \u201cemergency\u201d taxpayer funding,  without linking that funding to either  the COVID-19 pandemic or the upcoming election. The  bill  would also prohibit \u201cany change in the nature of postal services which will generally affect service on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis,\u201d and would explicitly tie this freeze on reforms to the period of the COVID-19 public health emergency. By  doing so, H.R. 8015 seeks to exploit  the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext for placing counterproductive restrictions on USPS\u2019s already limited operational flexibilities.  This bill misses an opportunity to improve USPS. In December 2018, the  President\u2019s  Task Force on the United States Postal System provided recommendations to Congress to set a course for USPS to operate under a sustainable business model, which would provide necessary mail  services to citizens and businesses while competing fairly in commercial  markets. Although implementing these recommendations is even more pressing today,  as  USPS proactively works  with State election officials to prepare  for Election Day on November 3, 2020, this bill ignores  them. Instead, it  would impose  burdensome new requirements  on USPS that would make it even  harder for USPS to deliver election mail.  Furthermore, this bill would create a private right of action against USPS for anyone claiming to have been harmed by its operational  reforms. If enacted, this provision would mark a radical shift in the legal framework governing USPS  operations and could subject the already heavily indebted agency to substantial litigation costs and risks. The trial  lawyers would benefit, while those who rely on USPS would suffer.   This bill  is an overreaction to sensationalized media reports that have made evidence-free accusations that USPS has undertaken reforms to achieve political rather  than operational objectives. USPS has not changed its service standards this year. And the reforms it has pursued have been the continuation of  incremental  reforms  USPS has pursued  under the leadership of three successive Postmaster Generals,  each of whom was selected by an independent  and bipartisan Board of Governors.  The Administration regrets that some have chosen to politicize required operational changes at USPS,  but it nevertheless appreciates Postmaster General Louis DeJoy\u2019s  commitment  to  delay these needed changes until after the election.  The broad prohibitions included  in H.R. 8015 would serve only  to further a false political narrative and introduce additional constraints on the ability of USPS  to deliver  life-saving drugs, critical  packages, economic relief payments,  and election mail.      USPS does not need a $25 billion bailout. It needs reforms that  will return it to a trend of  long-term financial self-sufficiency. USPS  has stated that, under  current authorities,  it has sufficient financial liquidity to maintain operations until August 2021.  As of June 30, 2020, USPS is in a strong cash position with almost $13 billion in reported cash on hand. Additionally, USPS recently  announced an agreement in principle with the Treasury  regarding the terms for up to $10 billion in support authorized by the CARES  Act if needed to fund its operating expenses  due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  As a result,  there  is no reason to suspect that USPS, which handled an average of 2.7 billion pieces of mail per week  in 2019, will  have any difficulty handling mail  volume associated with the 2020 election  unless Congress puts in place new requirements that make this important work more difficult.     The Administration looks forward to working with Congress on comprehensive legislation that  will provide additional financial support to hardworking Americans who have been  most severely affected  by the economic consequences of  the COVID-19  pandemic. This legislation could  also include financial or operational flexibilities to help  USPS  continue to provide critical services to the American people. H.R. 8015  takes the opposite approach, however,  and only adds to the significant challenges already facing USPS.   If H.R. 8015 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 205, the Protecting and Securing Florida\u2019s Coastline Act of 2019, H.R. 1146, the Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act, and H.R. 1941, the Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act.  These bills would undermine the Administration\u2019s commitment to a prosperous American economy supported by the responsible use of the Nation\u2019s abundant natural resources.  Development of our resources enhances our energy security and energy dominance, and produces high-paying American jobs; provides increased revenue to the Treasury, States, tribes, and local communities; and is a critical source of conservation funding. H.R. 1146 would prohibit the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management from administering an oil and gas leasing program in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. The bill would repeal a provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program for the development of the Coastal Plain that would allow the use of no more than about 0.01 percent of the total acreage of ANWR for surface development of production and support facilities.  The Administration supports environmentally responsible energy development in the Coastal Plain, also known as the 1002 Area, of ANWR.  Such development is expected to increase America\u2019s energy security and independence, create jobs, and provide affordable, reliable energy for consumers while providing much-needed revenue to both the State of Alaska and the Federal Government. Similarly, H.R. 205 and H.R. 1941 would both restrict future oil and gas development in the Federal waters of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  H.R. 205 would amend the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) to make permanent the current temporary leasing moratorium on offshore leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the west coast of Florida.  H.R. 1941 would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to permanently remove from consideration acreage for offshore leasing on both the Atlantic and Pacific OCS.  Both of these bills would undermine OCSLA, which established a periodic, multi-stage planning process involving State and tribal consultation and a thoughtful comparison and balancing of the benefits and impacts to all the regions of the OCS.  These bills would permanently constrain this careful administrative process.  Under the bills, large swaths of the OCS would be off limits for resource development without the benefit of periodic assessments of the potential economic, social, and environmental effects of development, as required by existing law.  Excluding these areas from  leasing consideration could place more pressure for development on other OCS areas and constrain our ability to meet national energy needs as required by OCSLA. Additionally, each of these bills would eliminate the potential for future direct revenue that would otherwise be provided to the Treasury, and through revenue sharing, to the States, tribes, and counties where the development activities occur.  In Fiscal Year 2018, energy development on Federal and Indian lands and waters generated approximately $9 billion in direct revenue from royalties, bonus bids, and rents.  Of that revenue, $1.78 billion was disbursed to 35 States.  The top States receiving Fiscal Year 2018 revenues were New Mexico ($634.9 million); Wyoming ($563.9 million); Colorado ($112.5 million); Louisiana ($91 million); and Utah ($76 million). Additionally, more than $1 billion was disbursed to Indian tribes and individual Indian mineral owners; $1.22 billion to the Reclamation Fund; $970 million to the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF); $150 million to the Historic Preservation Fund; and $3.5 billion to the general fund of the Treasury. Prohibiting energy development in new Federal areas would hinder future administrations\u2019 efforts to make up for revenue lost as production declines from leases in aging energy fields.  Such restrictions will tie the hands of future administrations and reduce their ability to enhance energy security through strong domestic energy production and to ensure affordable energy for American families. If these bills were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he veto them. * * * * * * * 2  ", "The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 4617, the Stopping Harmful Interference in Elections for a Lasting Democracy (SHIELD) Act.  The Administration agrees that transparency and accountability in elections are vital to the democratic process.  The SHIELD Act, however, is redundant, overly broad, ambiguous, and unenforceable.  The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) and current regulations already address the policy objectives of H.R. 4617, and the bill\u2019s expansive language would make impartial and predictable implementation of the law impossible. H.R. 4617\u2019s ambiguous language would ensnare American citizens and entities acting in good faith in its web of requirements and prohibitions.  Title I, Subtitle A, for example, would require political committees to self-report foreign contact to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) within one week and require political committees to establish a compliance protocol on self-reporting, among other new requirements.  H.R. 4617\u2019s broad definition of \u201creportable foreign contact,\u201d however, would result in significant over reporting to the FBI and FEC, leading to fruitless inquiries and wasted time and resources.  Given that Subtitle A would authorize criminal penalties and up to $1 million in civil fines, the parameters for self-reporting foreign contacts should not be ambiguous.  In fact, the bill\u2019s expansive definitions seem designed to instill a persistent fear among Americans engaged in political activity that any interactions they may have with a foreign national could put them in legal jeopardy and jeopardize the political viability of the candidates or issues they support.  Title I, Subtitle B purports to provide additional transparency to the public about who is purchasing political advertisements by imposing disclosure requirements on certain online platforms.  For example, Subtitle B defines a \u201cqualified political advertisement\u201d to include messages \u201crelating to any political matter of national importance, including . . . a national legislative issue of public importance.\u201d  The term \u201cnational legislative issue of public importance,\u201d however, is not defined.  Moreover, the bill includes a safe harbor that will exempt many online platforms from disclosure obligations, which could ultimately produce less transparency.  The safe harbor allows an online platform to avoid the transparency requirements if it independently makes the determination, using its \u201cbest efforts,\u201d that the request to purchase an advertisement was not subject to the statute\u2019s recordkeeping requirements.  The contours and scope of this extremely vague safe harbor, however, will likely be defined, if at all, through  regulations, creating a high likelihood that some platforms will be able to secure advantages over their competitors. The Administration also opposes Title II of H.R. 4617, which purports to close \u201cloopholes\u201d related to foreign nationals\u2019 financial campaign contributions made online and to certain entities. In reality, the conduct it addresses\u2014i.e., foreign nationals donating money to Super PACs or Corporate PACs\u2014is already prohibited. Foreign nationals are precluded from directing, controlling, and directly or indirectly participating in the decision-making process of any person, including a political committee, pertaining to any election-related activities. Moreover, foreign nationals cannot make contributions, donations, expenditures, or disbursements in connection with any elections in the United States. Furthermore, Title II would require a corporation, limited liability company, or partnership to file a certification that a foreign national was not involved in certain prohibited election activities with the FEC before speaking.  This provision could have the effect of precluding certain categories of speakers from commenting on events of national importance in the final days before a Federal election. While the Trump Administration seeks to limit foreign national interference in our elections by strengthening FECA and combatting illegal behavior, the SHIELD Act would produce harmful unintended consequences without achieving that goal.  Accordingly, the Administration opposes H.R. 4617. If H.R. 4617 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he veto it. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration opposes House passage of H.R. 1, the For the People  Act of 2019.  H.R. 1 proposes an overreach of Federal power  that would violate constitutional principles of  separation of powers, federalism, and freedom of speech.  H.R. 1 proposes to have the Federal  Government micromanage elections  that are largely and  properly within the purview of  the States themselves.   For example,  H.R. 1 would prohibit  commonsense  efforts to clean up voting-rolls to limit opportunities for voting fraud.  The bill would also require States to adopt online registration, same-day registration,  and automatic voter  registration, thus imposing a one-size-fits-all standard for  weighing  the competing  values  of voter access and voting integrity.  Furthermore,  H.R. 1 would enhance the powers of the Federal  Election Commission (FEC) Chairman and reduce the number of  FEC  members  from six to five, thus  increasing the chances that the FEC becomes  a partisan  entity with undue power to shape  and regulate  elections nationwide. In addition, the  legislation further advances political redistricting mandates.   Specifically, the legislation  would force States to create unelected  bodies and then delegate redistricting decisions  to them.  This would suppress  the voices of our Nation\u2019s citizens  and  cut off a nationwide debate on how best to pursue fair and ethical  redistricting  processes throughout the country.  H.R. 1 also  chills free speech  by creating requirements  that would limit the  ability  of Americans  to participate in advocacy  without undue compliance costs and without  fear of public reprisals.   The bill would establish costly and unnecessary programs  to finance political campaigns,  and force  American taxpayers  to finance  Federal candidates they may not support.   Finally, the legislation would implement a number of well-intentioned but  misguided ethics  reforms for Government  officials.   Many of these reforms, such as  giving the Office of  Government Ethics (OGE) the authority to review and approve decisions throughout the  Executive Branch and sheltering  its director from removal,  are inconsistent with the  constitutional structure of the executive branch, and would effectively  restrict  the ability of the  executive branch to fully  function as well as its ability to hire and retain an experienced and  knowledgeable workforce.

Instead of adding to this success, this joint resolution would upend longstanding principles of tax law and create confusion among taxpayers and preparers.

It also provides legal certainty for hundreds of thousands of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients, provides additional disaster relief to impacted communities, immediately reopens the Federal Government and funds it through the remainder of fiscal year (FY) 2019, and sets the stage for broader, permanent immigration reforms. To physically secure our southern border, the bill includes $5.7 billion for a steel barrier system, including embedded investments in technology and roads, in the priority areas on the southern border designated by professionals from the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In addition, this legislation provides critical funding to address several other needs at our southern border, including: \u2022 $800 million in humanitarian assistance, medical support, and new temporary housing;\u2022 $805 million for technology, canines, and personnel to help stop the flow of illegal drugs,weapons, and other contraband;\u2022 $782 million to hire an additional 2,750 border agents, law enforcement officers, andstaff;\u2022 $4.2 billion for space to detain those who are apprehended entering the Nation illegallyand who may pose a threat to the safety and security of our communities;\u2022 $563 million to support the immigration court system, including funding to hire 75 newimmigration judge teams to reduce the immigration court backlog of over 800,000 cases;and\u2022 a new system to allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their homecountries, and reforms to promote family reunification for unaccompanied children.In order to build the trust, goodwill, and bipartisan support necessary to begin real immigration reform, the Shelby Amendment provides three years of legislative relief for approximately 700,000 DACA recipients brought to the United States unlawfully as children by their parents.  This relief would prevent these DACA recipients from being deported and continue to allow  them access to work permits and Social Security numbers.  This legislation also provides a three-year extension of TPS for the over 300,000 immigrants whose protected status is currently facing expiration. In addition, the Shelby Amendment provides appropriations for FY 2019 that would immediately reopen the Federal Government for the American people, and provides disaster relief to impacted communities.  While the Administration remains concerned with the overall discretionary funding levels included in this bill, and with disaster spending that is unnecessary and premature, it supports this compromise approach as part of legislation that addresses the crises at the southern border.

In particular, the Administration strongly supports the extension of the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982 to ensure covert intelligence officers are protected without regard to their assigned location.  The Administration also supports the proposed transfer of the National Intelligence University to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The Administration looks forward to reviewing the classified schedule of authorizations and working with the Congress to address classified authorization levels.  Although the bill contains many provisions that advance the mission of the IC, it also includes provisions of significant concern, and we look forward to continuing to work with the Congress to address these concerns as outlined below. Limitations on determinations regarding certain security classifications.  The Administration strongly objects to section 2310 of the bill, which purports to preclude IC officers nominated for a position requiring Senate confirmation from making certain classification decisions.  This provision would unconstitutionally infringe on the President\u2019s control over national security information. IC Information Technology Environment (ITE).  The Administration objects to section 2312, which conflates the IC Information Environment with the IC Information Technology Enterprise (IC ITE), interferes with the intended purpose of the IC ITE, and risks reversing the gains achieved in establishing common platforms.  The provision treats the IC ITE construct itself as a major system deliverable with overly prescriptive testing and developmental requirements, and it would inflexibly require IC elements to use IC ITE, regardless of whether doing so in a given situation is either necessary or appropriate.  Further, the required business plan incorrectly assumes that all legacy applications are compatible with IC ITE. Unfunded Requirements of the IC.  The Administration objects to section 304, which would require the DNI to brief the congressional intelligence and appropriations committees on programs  and activities not funded in the President\u2019s Budget.  This provision infringes on the President\u2019s prerogatives to define priorities as he sees fit. ODNI Reporting Structure.  The Administration objects to sections 2404 and 2405, which would unnecessarily require two positions within ODNI, the IC Chief Financial Officer and IC Chief Information Officer, to report directly to the DNI.  These two positions already serve statutory roles as the DNI\u2019s principal advisors within their areas of expertise.  As such, they already have and will continue to have direct access to the DNI and Principal Deputy DNI to execute their responsibilities. Reporting Requirements.  The Administration objects to certain reporting requirements in the bill.  The bill contains over 50 new reporting and briefing requirements, including several that recur periodically, which would exceed the IC\u2019s ability to respond in a timely manner and would require the IC to shift limited resources away from executing its critical missions. Furthermore, the Administration strongly objects to sections 308, 602, and 2718 to the extent they would require reporting of information about ongoing law enforcement investigations.  The extensive data reporting required by section 602 would, in particular, significantly strain the resources of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The Administration also objects to section 702, which purports to require the production of deliberative executive branch information, and to section 2720, which would affect the Vulnerabilities Equities Process.  In addition, sections 501, 502, and 503 should reflect the Committee\u2019s consultations with the Department of State. Security Clearance Reform.  The Administration appreciates support from the Committee for improving the security clearance process; the Administration is concerned, however, that the cumulative amount of burdensome reporting and short deadlines included in title XXVI would slow down current reform initiatives.  In particular, the Administration objects to section 2604\u2019s establishment of timelines for conducting security clearances, as the prescribed deadlines are not based on empirical data and do not take into account the transformation activities already underway to significantly streamline the clearance process.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress to ensure appropriate performance measures are established as the current reform initiatives are implemented. Election Matters.  The Administration has several concerns with certain aspects of the bill\u2019s election-related provisions.  Section 2501 would require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to disclose sensitive information obtained through voluntary partnerships that may not have anticipated such disclosures.  Section 2503 would require the IC to conduct assessments of security vulnerabilities of State election systems, which is outside the scope of appropriate IC activities. Section 2505 is redundant of existing requirements.  And section 2506 would duplicate ongoing DHS information-sharing activities.  Moreover, the posture review required by section 2502 should be updated, and DHS should take the lead with respect to the strategy required by section 2504, given its domestic focus.  The strategy should also be scoped to the threat rather than to specific countries. Paid Parental Leave.  While the Administration supports paid parental leave, it has concerns with limiting such a program to a select few Federal agencies.  The Administration looks forward to 2  working with the Congress on proposals to provide parental leave to all families nationwide, including to all United States government employees, as set forth in the President\u2019s Budget. Establishment of Energy Infrastructure Security Center.  The Administration has significant concerns regarding section 2422, which would require the President to establish an Energy Infrastructure Security Center within the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence at the Department of Energy.  The proposed center would create a vast infrastructure that is not needed to appropriately evaluate or mitigate cyber threats to critical energy infrastructure.  The Administration would instead continue to pursue ongoing initiatives to study, better understand, and improve mitigations that address the cybersecurity threat to critical infrastructure. 3  ", "The Administration opposes H.R. 268, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2019, making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes.  While the Administration supports the provision of efficient and effective disaster relief to impacted communities and agencies, it is concerned that the bill includes funding that is unnecessary, excessive, premature, and duplicative of other Federal funds. The Congress should not use natural disasters as a pretext to engage in unnecessary spending outside of the agreed-upon discretionary spending caps. In response to the numerous recent disasters that have hit States and territories, the Administration acted swiftly to provide relief to those in need and begin the process of identifying the resources required for long-term recovery.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF)\u2014a significant mechanism through which the Federal Government conducts response efforts for major disasters and emergencies\u2014has sufficient balances to address all immediate threats to life and property resulting from these recent disasters.  The only supplemental appropriations the Administration is seeking at this time are those that would address the ongoing security and humanitarian crisis along the southern border.   The Administration also has a number of specific policy and funding concerns with the legislation.  For instance, H.R. 268 includes $600 million in excessive and unnecessary funding for Puerto Rico\u2019s Nutrition Assistance Program (NAP), $849 million in excessive Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funding, and other line-item funding, which the Administration has not requested, that is well in excess of the levels included in the disaster bill that passed in December of last year.  The bill also includes a number of policy changes that would waive or reduce cost sharing for State and local governments and other non-Federal entities, thus reducing a key incentive to limit excessive and unnecessary spending.  Finally, the bill makes unnecessary changes to the Department of Agriculture\u2019s trade mitigation payments that would allow funds to go to those with adjusted gross income (AGI) over $900,000.   In addition, the Administration recognizes that there may be an effort to amend H.R. 268 with a manager\u2019s amendment containing a continuing resolution through February 8, 2019.  As the Administration has relayed in multiple Statements of Administration Policy since the beginning of the current lapse in appropriations, including such a continuing resolution without a broader agreement to address the border crisis is unacceptable.  If H.R. 268 were presented to the President with a continuing resolution included, his advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the House Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop and Livestock Losses.  The Administration does not support the $1.1 billion provided for crop and livestock losses.  Existing USDA safety net programs, including crop insurance, can provide this assistance to producers.  Emergency Forest Restoration.  The bill includes $480 million for restoration of storm-damaged forests.  This amount is excessive and unnecessarily increases Federal costs, therefore the Administration does not support it. Rural Development.  The Administration objects to the $150 million included in the bill for Rural Development Housing, Water and Wastewater, and Community Facilities programs.  These funds were not requested and duplicate program resources that are available through the annual budget process.  Trade Mitigation Payments.  The Administration does not support section 104, which would change eligibility criteria for Market Facilitation Payments to allow producers with higher AGI to receive payments.  The existing eligibility criteria are consistent with other price and income support payments.    Nutrition Assistance, Puerto Rico.  The bill provides $600 million for Puerto Rico\u2019s NAP.  This funding is excessive and unnecessary.  USDA has been working closely with Puerto Rico to develop and implement a plan to return the NAP to normal operations after providing significant additional resources immediately after the 2017 hurricanes.  There is no indication that households need ongoing support at this time or that Puerto Rico requires additional time to return to normal NAP operations. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration (EDA), Economic Development Assistance Programs.  The Administration objects to the $600 million included in the bill for EDA\u2019s disaster recovery grants, which is in addition to the $600 million in unrequested funding provided in the prior year.  EDA\u2019s disaster grant programs are duplicative of other disaster assistance programs, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery.  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund Grants.  The Administration opposes the inclusion of $50 million for grants from the National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund.  These grant funds, which support research on ocean and coastal resources, are not necessary to address the immediate impacts of the disasters 2  experienced last year.   NOAA, Fisheries Disaster Assistance.  The Administration objects to the $150 million included in the bill for fisheries disaster assistance.  This amount is excessive and not directly tied to the actual economic losses from declared disasters in 2018.    Army Corps of Engineers  Construction of New Flood Risk Reduction Projects.  The Administration opposes emergency funding for the construction of new projects.  The Army Corps has sufficient funding to address all priority repairs to existing infrastructure it has identified.  The construction of new projects or studies to develop potential new projects to address the risks associated with future storms should be considered on a national level to address the most significant risks to public safety as well as the costs and benefits of potential investments.  Further, the Administration opposes waiving upfront cost share requirements by non-Federal sponsors for the study or construction of new projects which shifts these costs from beneficiaries of these projects to taxpayers.     Department of Energy  Office of Electricity.  The Administration does not support the $16 million provided in the bill for the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Electricity to provide technical assistance related to recently-declared disasters.  Technical assistance can be prioritized and executed as needed within available funding.   Department of Homeland Security  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Disaster Assistance.  The Administration strongly objects to language waiving non-Federal cost shares for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for Hurricanes Maria and Irma.  Cost shares are critical to ensure that work with impacted jurisdictions is collaborative and that both partners have incentives to operate efficiently and control costs.  Further, the Administration is concerned with language that would waive FEMA\u2019s pre-disaster condition limitation for certain disasters.  Removing the limitation could cause FEMA to reimburse impacted jurisdictions for costs unrelated to disasters.    Environmental Protection Agency  State Revolving Funds.  The Administration does not support the $849 million provided for the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs), as the funds are excessive and go beyond core emergency response activities.  For example, $500 million is provided to the SRFs for areas impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria to support work exceeding normal core response activities, including projects to address future flood damage risk and vulnerability.  In addition, the $349 million provided to the SRFs for projects to improve drinking and clean water infrastructure impacted by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Yutu, and 2018 earthquakes and wildfires is excessive given the funding that FEMA is providing to bring those systems back into operation.  3   Department of Education  Education-Related Disaster Relief.  The Administration objects to the inclusion of $165 million for education-related disaster relief as it is excessive and duplicative.  The $50 million approved by the prior Congress in H.R. 695 was sufficient to satisfy education-related needs associated with recent disasters.   Department of Housing and Urban Development  Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR).  The Administration also opposes the inclusion of the unrequested and excessive $1.2 billion for CDBG-DR in 2018, which is in addition to the unrequested $1.7 billion that was appropriated for similar purposes in the prior year.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure appropriate and sufficient funds are provided to respond to natural disasters.  * * * * * * *  4   ", "The Administration supports the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1892, the Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act,  2018.  This bill funds most Government programs at current levels through March 23,  2018, while incorporating the text of the House-passed fiscal year (FY) 2018 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, which provides the resources the military needs to keep the Nation safe.  As the Administration has noted previously, the House-passed Department of Defense Appropriations Act is consistent with the President\u2019s pledge to undo the looming defense spending reductions that are  harmful to America\u2019s national security and military readiness. The House-passed Department of Defense Appropriations Act incorporated in the bill includes a total of $659 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD), including  $584 billion in base spending and $75 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.  These amounts are consistent with a total funding level for DOD similar to that authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which was signed into law by the President.   It includes $1.2 billion requested by the Administration to  support increased troop levels in Afghanistan, special operations forces capabilities, and other urgent needs. The United States military\u2019s greatest asset is the men and women who volunteer to serve.  This bill keeps faith with service members by providing a 2.4 percent military pay raise.  It increases end strength across the military  services for active duty, reserve, and National Guard personnel, and includes funding for  training and maintenance to ensure that United States troops are properly equipped and ready to fight. In addition to supporting the defense bill, the Administration supports language in  the House Amendment to H.R. 1892 that provides for an extension of  a variety of healthcare provisions, including Community Health Centers.  The Administration is also appreciative that the bill includes language requested by the Administration to ensure continuity of operations for the 2020 Decennial Census Program and the Small Business Administration\u2019s Disaster Loans Program. The Administration supports continuing discussions over a two-year budget agreement that ensures funding for national defense and other priorities.  As those discussions continue, however, it is dangerous to hold defense funding for the current fiscal year hostage to arbitrary demands for lower-priority domestic programs. If the Further Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act,  2018, were presented to  the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. * * * * * * * ", "The Administration supports S. 1094.  The Administration is committed to ensuring the Nation\u2019s veterans have access to the care, services, and benefits they have earned.  To achieve this goal, it is critical that employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are held to the highest performance standards, and that they are accountable when those standards are not met.  In addition, it is important that employees be able to discuss concerns without fear of retribution or reprisal, particularly when those concerns deal with the quality of care Federal employees provide to our veterans.  Therefore, whistleblower rights and processes must be clear and unambiguous.  S. 1094 holds VA employees to high standards of performance and conduct, and clarifies whistleblower rights and processes. The Administration thanks the Senate for passing this important bill, and looks forward to passage in the House of Representatives. If S. 1094 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.                                                                   * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration is already using existing Medicaid 1115 demonstration authority to enable States to use Medicaid resources for inpatient opioid abuse recovery services, and this bill would be consistent with this constructive policy.  H.R. 6082, the Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act, may improve care for patients with  substance use disorders by updating information sharing to better align with existing HIPAA regulations.  Patients suffering or recovering from opioid addiction must access services from doctors, treatment facilities, and hospitals across an increasingly complex healthcare system.  This bill would enhance coordinated care while protecting patient privacy.  The Administration is supportive of this effort and looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that this bill does not have unintended effects. H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, combines a number of bipartisan initiatives that would improve Medicare and Medicaid and strengthen efforts to prevent and treat opioid abuse by patients enrolled in these health programs.  The bill\u2019s Medicaid changes would protect vulnerable youth, enhance monitoring to detect irresponsible and abusive opioid prescribing, and encourage States to increase coverage of treatment for substance use disorders.  H.R. 6 would also enable Medicare to encourage the use of safe and effective alternatives to opioids for pain, screen enrollees for opioid abuse, require secure prescribing of opioids to prevent diversion and misuse, and facilitate coverage of medication-assisted treatment and telehealth services for opioid use disorders.  Finally, this bill would support the development of non-addictive opioid alternatives, provide grants to local public health laboratories that detect synthetic opioids, and expand the ability of medical professionals to prescribe medications that help patients overcome addiction.  The Administration appreciates the Congress\u2019s efforts to prevent opioid overdose deaths and looks forward to working to refine some parts of this bill, such as the proposed pilot on testing drugs for adulterants. These initiatives represent bold, evidence-based steps to prevent and treat opioid abuse, and will help save the lives of countless Americans.  The Administration commends the House on taking up these important bills and looks forward to working together to take all necessary steps to tackle the opioid crisis.  The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 5797, H.R. 6082, and H.R. 6, and looks forward to working with the Congress to address the opioid crisis as the legislative process continues. * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports passage of the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018.  In accordance with the spending levels set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, the bill provides $1.3 trillion in discretionary funding for fiscal year (FY) 2018, including adjustments, with $695 billion for national defense and $600 billion for non-defense activities.  While the bill is far from perfect, it funds numerous critical Administration priorities, including rebuilding the military, securing the border, combatting the opioid crisis, promoting school safety, empowering American working families, and providing a robust investment in infrastructure. Since day one, the President and his Administration have been committed to ensuring the American military remains the strongest in the world.  The bill supports an overall funding level of $665 billion for the Department of Defense, including $599 billion in base discretionary funds and $66 billion in Global War on Terror/Overseas Contingency Operations funds.  This tremendous investment in our Armed Forces includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for the troops, the largest since 2010; $144 billion for new and upgraded platforms, weapons, and equipment, an increase of over $20 billion from FY 2017; and funding for ongoing operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and other adversaries around the world.  Pursuant to the National Defense Strategy, these funds would ensure our military is postured to combat the full spectrum of threats we face today, invest in domains central to tomorrow's conflicts such as space and cyber, sustain American influence globally, and safeguard the free and open international order.  The bill provides a down payment on the President's promise to secure our borders.  It provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and associated technology along the Southwest border, funding 110 miles of border wall system.  However, it fails to fund the highest priority areas identified by border security professionals with decades of experience, areas where this investment is needed most and will have the most significant impact.  It also increases funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement by 10 percent.  The Administration is deeply disappointed in those Members of Congress who recklessly set funding for detention beds below levels that the Department of Homeland Security deems necessary to detain illegal aliens and enforce our Nation's laws.  Without reservation, the Administration will execute its immigration enforcement mission, using all available authorities and resources. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $4 billion in high priority investments to fund the President's Opioid Initiative and combat this growing crisis.  These resources will expand access  to prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. It also includes $330 million for Department of Justice grant programs that support drug courts, treatment, and law enforcement and community responses, $130 million for the Rural Communities Opioid Response program, and $386 million for opioid-related programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In addition, the bill prioritizes funding at the Department of Justice for the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Organized Drug Enforcement Task Force for fighting drug addiction and the opioid crisis.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides robust funding levels for infrastructure.  This includes $635 million in rural broadband, $500 million for rural water and wastewater grants and loans, and $2 billion to repair and enhance VA medical facilities and State Veterans Homes. The bill also includes substantial increases for core infrastructure, such as highways, airports, railways, and waterways.  The Administration also appreciates that the Congress has chosen to channel a significant share of this increase to competitive, merit-based infrastructure grant programs without providing an unfair advantage to certain projects.  The Administration is strongly supportive of both the STOP School Violence Act and the Fix NICS Act and appreciates their inclusion in the bill, along with other funding for critical public and school safety programs across the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services, and Justice.  The bill includes additional resources to improve school safety, including $75 million to support the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative, full funding for mental health programs authorized in the 21st Century Cures Act, and increased funding for research grants to improve bullying prevention, counseling, gang enforcement, and training for school personnel.  The bill also includes funding to improve the National Instant Criminal Background System (NICS), and to incentivize States to submit complete, accurate, and timely records.   The bill helps American families secure better jobs by increasing funding for apprenticeships\u2014an effective earn and learn training approach\u2014by more than 50 percent.  The bill also provides significant new investments in child care, including nearly $2.4 billion in additional funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which will help families access and afford the care they need while they work, go to school, or enroll in job training.  The bill also advances the President's historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by providing resources for implementation of the tax law, as well as addressing an unintended problem with section 199(A) that created market distortions in farm country.  Further, the creation of a new wildfire suppression cap adjustment and accompanying land management reforms will improve the Federal Government's ability to prevent and respond to wildfires.    The Administration also commends the Congress for including the Taylor Force Act, which prohibits most U.S. foreign assistance that directly benefits the Palestinian Authority (PA) until the PA ends the abhorrent practice of providing payments to terrorists and their families in reward for acts of violence.  The Administration is strongly supportive of the CLOUD Act, which empowers law enforcement to better protect the public from serious crime and terrorism and will improve international comity.   A strong military and secure border are the centerpieces of the Administration's efforts to keep the Nation safe.  H.R. 1625, the product of negotiation and compromise, includes wasteful spending increases in order to secure bipartisan support.

Instead, under this bill, those grant funds would be reallocated to States and localities that comply with Federal law.  Additionally, this bill would provide for more robust detention of criminal aliens.  The Administration is committed to strengthening enforcement of our Nation\u2019s immigration laws in order to improve national security and public safety.

For months, the Administration has supported multiple bills that repeal central parts of Obamacare and include replacement provisions, such as market stability funding and an expansion of Health Savings Accounts.  These bills include H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017, and the Senate amendment to H.R. 1628, the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017.  Both pieces of legislation fulfill President Trump\u2019s promise to provide relief to Americans suffering from the failures of Obamacare and to transition to a better healthcare system by taking power out of Washington and returning it to the States and to families.   H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which passed both chambers in 2015, outlines yet another path to providing relief from Obamacare.  This bill repeals Obamacare\u2019s damaging individual and employer mandate penalties and its tax increases, while providing a reasonable transition period for the Congress to enact patient-centered healthcare.  The Administration supports H.R. 3762 as a first step in a multi-step repeal-and-replace process. As Obamacare exchanges continue a collapse that began years ago, the Administration firmly believes that inaction on healthcare reform is not an option. The Administration strongly encourages all Senators to support the Motion to Proceed to H.R. 1628 and to move forward on repealing Obamacare and replacing it with true reforms that expand choice and lower costs.  ", "The Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burden on all Americans.  On January 30, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13771, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which provides for repeal of two regulations for every new one issued.  This historic step accelerates the retrospective review process to make common-sense reforms to regulations across the Federal Government.  Legislation is helpful where it amends agencies' regulatory processes to ensure they are transparent, and appropriately balance costs and benefits.   Each of these bills would address different aspects of the regulatory process.  The SCRUB Act, H.R. 998, addresses the numerous outdated, duplicative, and otherwise unnecessary regulations that have accumulated throughout government.  The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, H.R. 1004, would restrict the use of agency funds to advocate on behalf of regulations, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act, H.R. 1009, would codify specific executive branch regulatory review procedures.    The Administration supports the SCRUB Act, the Regulatory Integrity Act, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on technical and other amendments to these bills.  The Administration appreciates the efforts of the Congress to rationalize the regulatory system and looks forward to continuing to work together to reform the regulatory process.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration appreciates the continued work by the Senate Armed Services Committee (Committee) on behalf of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in S. 1519, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. The bill supports key Administration priorities including ending the defense sequester, rebuilding our military readiness, and modernizing our Armed Forces for the future.  It authorizes funding for our ongoing efforts to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), to deter potential adversaries, and to bolster our allies.  The bill also includes substantial reforms to Department of Defense (DOD) management and business practices, and the Administration looks forward to working with the Committee to continue finding efficiencies at DOD.  In particular, the Administration is fully committed to DOD\u2019s full financial statement audit efforts starting in FY 2018 and shares the Committee\u2019s goal of achieving a positive audit opinion over time.  The Administration will work closely with the Committee on language that facilitates this effort.  The Administration also appreciates the bill\u2019s inclusion of the 2010 Compact Review Agreement with Palau and its related authorities.   The bill authorizes $692.1 billion in total discretionary funding for FY 2018, consisting of $631.9 billion of base national defense funding ($36.7 billion above the President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget request) and $60.2 billion of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding ($4.4 billion below the President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget request).  The previous Administration enacted harmful cuts to defense spending, and this Administration strongly supports eliminating them.  To ensure that our military is not rebuilt on the backs of future generations of Americans, however, the Administration looks forward to enacting reductions to non-defense spending, including those proposed in its FY18 Budget. While the bill contains many promising reforms, it prohibits a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, which would produce substantial recurring savings and allow DOD to align infrastructure with force structure.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address its concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the classified annex and working with the Congress to address its concerns about the bill provisions regarding classified programs. 1   Prohibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure Round:  The Administration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges Congress to provide BRAC authorization, as requested, so that DOD can ensure it is not wasting resources on unneeded infrastructure.  The Department estimates that a new BRAC round in 2021 would save an additional $2 billion or more annually, resources which could be devoted to higher priorities such as readiness and modernization.   Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility: The Administration strongly objects to continued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility as directed in section 3112.  While the Administration appreciates the waiver authority to terminate the MOX project provided to the Secretary of Energy, the project is unaffordable and risky.  The most recent estimates, produced by the Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers, project $12 billion in remaining costs and total construction costs of $17 billion.  In addition, the projected operating costs are between $800 million and $1 billion per year for nearly two decades.  The alternative, known as dilute and dispose, is a proven approach that is significantly less risky and expensive, and it can be implemented decades sooner than the MOX approach.  TRICARE Benefit Reform:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of meaningful TRICARE benefit reform proposals reflected in sections 706 and 707.  Section 706 institutes reasonable pharmacy co-pays that will retain TRICARE as one of the most generous health benefits available while also making it sustainable in the long term.  Section 707 eliminates confusion and reduces administrative costs by creating one generous, consistent health benefit that is equal for all members while making special accommodations for the most vulnerable populations, including medically retired members and their families and survivors of those who died on active duty.   Authority to Provide Assistance to Counter ISIS and to the Vetted Syrian Opposition:   The Administration appreciates the expanded authority in sections 1231 and 1232 for small-scale construction of temporary facilities to meet operational needs and force protection requirements in both Iraq and Syria. The Administration objects, however, to language in section 1232 that requires the Secretary to provide a 30-day notice to Congress on new initiatives.  This provision will hamper DOD\u2019s ability to respond rapidly to opportunities on the battlefield.   Modification of the President\u2019s Authority to Determine Alternative Pay Adjustment in Annual Basic Pay of Members of the Uniformed Services:  The Administration strongly objects to section 604, which would place restrictions on the President\u2019s authority to set an alternative pay adjustment for members of the uniformed services.  This change would place more restrictions  on the President\u2019s ability to set pay for members of the uniformed services than for the Federal workforce.  Being able to adjust military compensation nimbly in response to serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare is not only essential to the Administration\u2019s responsibility to recruit and retain a ready and capable uniformed services, but it is also required to balance military compensation costs against other investments critical to readiness, equipment, and modernization.      2   Provisions on the Organization and Structure of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD): The Administration is concerned with sections 901, 902, 910, and 921, which would significantly reorganize DOD and its components.  In order to address those concerns, DOD hopes to work collaboratively with the Committee to better understand the justifications for these provisions. In their current form, these sections seem to hinder DOD\u2019s ability to stabilize its senior leadership team and manage the functions and capabilities needed to plan, execute, and oversee national security policies, capability development, and operations.  Sections 901 and 902 would alter DOD\u2019s planning and would require adjustments before DOD is able to implement changes enacted last year.  The Administration is also concerned with the creation of additional Executive Schedule Level II positions in OSD.  This reporting structure could complicate the relationship between the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Defense.  In addition, section 921 would eliminate each of the military department Assistant Secretaries charged with real property, installation, and facility management.  Eliminating these three Assistant Secretary positions would jeopardize each military department Secretary\u2019s ability to comply with his or her title 10 responsibilities.   Personnel Limitations:  The Administration strongly objects to section 912, which would modify the definition of personnel in section 143(b) of title 10, United States Code, by adding the contractor personnel counts against the statutory limitation of 3,767 for military, Government civilian, and detailed personnel in OSD and the OSD direct support activities of the Washington Headquarters Services. Management of the contractor personnel counts in OSD has been addressed through the funding ceiling imposed on all departmental headquarters by section 346(b).  The Administration also strongly objects to section 931, which would further increase the Senior Executive Service (SES) reduction set forth in the FY 2017 NDAA by an additional 10 percent, because it would be detrimental to the overall DOD mission and, especially, the SES workforce.  Requiring the Department to arbitrarily cut additional SES positions across-the-board would have long-term negative effects or likely effects for various DOD services and organizations.  Any further reductions to SES positions in DOD should be made in a deliberate manner following a review and analysis of the impact of such reductions on the functioning of each component or agency.    Adjustment to Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) of Certain Members of the Uniformed Services:  The Administration objects to section 603, which would make a military member who is married to another military member ineligible for a BAH at the \u201cwith dependents\u201d rate.  This section would inappropriately penalize military families in which both spouses have chosen to serve their country and, by providing a lesser compensation package than other members of equal grade, send a clear message that their service is not valued as highly.    Aviation Bonuses:  The Administration strongly objects to sections 616 and 617, which would eliminate DOD\u2019s current flexibilities and impair DOD\u2019s ability to manage the payment of aviation bonuses for well-established reasons.  Sections 616 and 617 would harm DOD\u2019s ability to respond to current heavy recruiting by the civilian airline industry from the military pilot community and would hamper DOD\u2019s ability to appropriately manage bonuses and to differentiate bonus levels for enlisted members who pilot remotely piloted aircraft.   3   Modification of Cost Limitation Baseline for CVN-78 Class Aircraft Carrier Program:  The Administration strongly objects to section 125, which would limit the procurement cost for aircraft carriers after CVN-79 to $12 billion.  The Administration shares the Committee\u2019s concern with the cost of the CVN-78 Class Aircraft Carrier Program  and CVN-80 and beyond.  The Navy\u2019s estimate for CVN-80, however, is $12.6 billion, not including class spares, which is approximately $900 million lower than CVN-79 in constant dollars.  Reducing procurement cost for CVN-80 and follow-on ships to $12 billion cannot be achieved without a fundamental change in acquisition strategy (such as multi-year procurement or block-buy contracts that leverage economies of scale) and continuous construction efficiencies, along with significant design modifications that will reduce ship capability.  Stability in ship design and funding is the most effective way to achieve significant cost reductions.   Discharge in the Selected Reserve of the Commissioned Service Obligation of Military Service Academy Graduates who Participate in Professional Athletics: The Administration strongly objects to section 543, which would allow newly commissioned officers graduating from  the military service academies, who obtain employment as professional athletes, to forego any active duty service and immediately serve in the Selected Reserve until the completion of their commissioned service obligation.  The military service academies exist to develop future officers who enhance the readiness and lethality of the military services.  Following graduation from  a military service academy, individuals  should serve as full-fledged military officers, carrying out the normal work and career expectations of an officer who has received the extraordinary benefits of a taxpayer-funded military academy education.   Transfer of Lead of Guam Oversight Council (GOC) from the Deputy Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of the Navy: The Administration strongly objects to section 951, which would transfer lead of the GOC from  the Deputy Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of the Navy.  The GOC oversees more than just Navy and Marine Corps activities and, when led by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, is able to balance international commitments against various Service considerations in developing policy direction.  In addition to the realignment of Marine forces from  Okinawa to Guam, the GOC is monitoring U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Joint Military Training proposal to develop live-fire ranges and training areas in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (the CNMI) (Tinian and Pagan), and U.S. Air Force Divert and Exercise Airfield for up to 12 tankers on the CNMI.  The interagency coordination necessary to complete required environmental analyses for these complex initiatives is most effectively accomplished with direct oversight by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  Workforce Issues for Relocation of Marines to Guam:  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of section 1264, which would authorize the admission before December 31, 2023, of H-2B workers coming to Guam  to perform  certain military-related work under modified admission requirements.  The Administration strongly urges Congress to adopt the Administration\u2019s request, which would address specified needs in both Guam  and the CNMI.  The Department of the Navy\u2019s current workload projections indicate that approximately 2,300 H-2B workers would be required to supplement the Guam or CNMI workforce on military build-up construction projects.  Without additional H-2B workers, limited access to construction 4   workers would harm our ability to relocate Marines to Guam on planned timelines.  This could be a factor in meeting the commitment of the United States to return land to Japan.    Policy of the United States on Cyberspace, Cybersecurity, and Cyberwarfare:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1621, which would establish United States policy for deterring and responding to cyber-attacks or other malicious cyber-activities against United States interests.  This section would enact certain foreign policy and military determinations that are traditionally within the purview of the President.  Development of such policy decisions must necessarily take into account changing circumstances on a more rapid timeline than the proposed legislative process would allow.  In particular, section 1621(f) would require the United States to notify and encourage the governments of countries whose computer networks are being used by malicious cyber actors to take action themselves to eliminate the threat, to the greatest extent practicable. This would severely constrain the President\u2019s decision space and undermine the ability of the Armed Forces to act rapidly and decisively, in accordance with applicable law, to neutralize threats and to defend United States national interests in cyberspace.    Reductions to Army Networking Programs: The Administration strongly objects to the severe   funding reductions in sections 4101and 4201, and prohibitive language in sections 112 and 234, which would affect the Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, Distributed Common Ground System-Army, and Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense programs.  These limitations would cripple the Army\u2019s efforts to provide commanders with a unified communications network while working on a solution to  fill a critical capability gap regarding on-the-move communications.  These constraints also would hamper the ability to provide reliable intelligence analysis down to the battalion level and to ensure that integrated sensors and weapons support current and future Air and Missile Defense systems.  At this stage of development, limitations of this magnitude would delay delivery of critical capabilities to our soldiers by at least two years.    Development of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Range Ground-Launched Missile System:  The Administration objects to section 1635, which would establish a program of record to develop a road-mobile, ground-launched missile system  and would prohibit any authorization of funds for research and development until a detailed analysis of systems is delivered to defense committees.  The Administration is currently developing an integrated diplomatic, military, and economic response strategy to maximize pressure on Russia.  It is also evaluating those military capabilities that are needed to protect our national security.  This provision unhelpfully ties the Administration to a specific type of missile system and funding requirements, which would limit potential military response options.  The Administration would support broad authorization of research and development on missile systems, including those prohibited by the treaty, to determine candidate systems that could become programs of record.  Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems:  The Administration is disappointed that its proposal on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is not included in the bill.   For multiple economic and national security reasons, the Administration supports the safe and secure integration of UAS into the national airspace, but that requires the development of a legal framework that protects the public from  those who would misuse this technology, such as recklessly flying near major airports, intentionally conducting surveillance, or facilitating attacks.  Under current law, the Government is unable to fully evaluate or use essential detection, tracking, and mitigation 5   technologies to counter these rapidly advancing threats.  The proposal would provide a tailored grant of authority within a framework for effective oversight and protections of privacy, civil liberties, and airspace safety. Next National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) West (N2W) Campus:  The Administration strongly objects to the Committee\u2019s decision to reduce N2W by $331 million through an incremental funding approach and recommends that funding be provided at the President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget request level.  The Administration objects to this type of incremental funding for military construction projects because  it undermines program stability and cost discipline and could negatively impact other mission-critical priorities.  In the case of this project, the NGA expects to obligate the full amount of the budget request in FY 2018.  Navy Shipbuilding:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for Navy shipbuilding; the Administration, however, objects to the authorization of funding for only one Littoral Combat Ship, one fewer than the Administration requested, as well as the authorization of partial funding for an additional amphibious ship LX(R).  In addition, the Administration strongly objects to section 124, which provides permanent incremental funding authority for the procurement of the LX(R) ship class or the amphibious transport dock ship (LPD-30) class. Incremental funding undermines program stability and cost discipline.    Missile Defense:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for missile defense; the Administration, however, regards section 1653 as premature given that the Ballistic Missile Defense Review (BMDR) is still underway.  The provision would require the Secretary of Defense to deploy up to 14 additional ground-based interceptors (GBIs), store up to 14 GBIs, and complete any required supporting construction at Fort Greely, Alaska, no later than December 31, 2021.  After the BMDR is completed, the Administration will provide recommendations on how best to strengthen our Nation\u2019s missile defense.  Exercise on Assessing Cybersecurity Support to Election Systems of States:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1630, which would require DOD to exercise for a mission inconsistent with its statutory authority, as well as with democratic norms  on the role of the military in American political affairs.  The Department of Homeland Security is the Federal lead for critical infrastructure, including electoral infrastructure.  In addition, section 1630 would direct the Secretary of Defense to intrude on the authority of State Governors to determine how to use their own State National Guard forces to carry out a State cybersecurity mission to protect State election systems.  TRICARE Advantage Demonstration Program:  The Administration objects to section 701, which would require the Secretary of Defense to establish a demonstration program to contract with and automatically enroll TRICARE beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage plans.  Automatic enrollment of beneficiaries eligible for both Medicare and TRICARE into a Medicare Advantage plan is undesirable and unworkable.  In addition, there is existing demonstration project authority under both Medicare and TRICARE to evaluate any appropriate collaborative initiatives.  Foreign Military Sales:  The Administration objects to section 1283, which would require the Defense Security Cooperation Agency to consult with United States commercial entities before 6   delivering a formal pricing and availability response to a foreign customer.  Section 1283 would significantly delay responses to a partner\u2019s request for price and availability data, and also could result in the United States not being able to respond in time for an international competition.  Mandating such procedures would be inconsistent with existing federal procurement rules, could negatively affect open competition in the acquisition process,  and slow it to the point of resulting in loss of sales.   Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF):  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s willingness to revise changes made to the SDAF in the FY 2017 NDAA.  The Administration objects, however, to section 1281 because it would preclude using available funding in the SDAF account to purchase defense articles and services other than precision guided munitions.  The SDAF is a revolving fund and the available funding obligational authority amount fluctuates throughout the year.  By mandating that 20 percent of the available obligation authority be used to purchase precision guided munitions every year, the Administration will not have sufficient funding available to purchase any other defense articles or services that will likely be urgently needed by our friends and allies, including those participating in coalition operations that directly support our national interests.  SDAF is an important security cooperation authority, as it makes the United States more responsive to the military needs of our international partners, and enhances readiness of our Armed Forces by reducing the need to divert assets from  them to support urgent foreign requirements.  Defense Export Licensing:  The Administration supports the goals in section 867 to use flexible comprehensive defense export authorizations, including for large international cooperation defense programs, but emphasizes that the Secretary of State already has the authority to undertake this effort.  Since enactment of the Arms Exports Control Act (AECA) in 1976, the Secretary of State has had exclusive responsibility for defense sales and defense exports, including defense export licensing.  Over the years, the State Department has always worked closely with its key partner agency, DOD, on these issues.  Therefore, no additional authority is needed, and such authority could cause confusion.  Should this section be retained, the authority should be vested in the Secretary of State so as to minimize overlapping, duplicative statutory authorities and frameworks.  Further, the Administration objects to the mandate in subsection (b), since the longstanding practice is to permit industry to select which of the available licensing authorizations it wishes to use, and restricting this practice would likely create unnecessary regulatory burdens. DOD Support for Corporate Activities and Charitable Organizations:  The Administration recognizes the value of United States charitable organizations and notes the existing mechanisms  through which DOD supports State and United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-led reconstruction, development, and stabilization efforts globally, including foreign disaster relief and humanitarian assistance.  The Administration has not, however, assessed whether support to a particular organization, as outlined in section 1083, may be undertaken consistent with any other relevant law concerning the provision of non-reimbursable assistance such as military personnel and the use of DOD facilities and other assets by such organizations.  The Administration is also concerned about the implications of having a private entity receive preferential support from DOD in security cooperation or operational efforts.  Such preferential treatment would cause confusion among existing networks of non-governmental organizations 7   supported by State and USAID in these programmatic areas regarding the recognized need for maintaining a distinction between military and civilian missions, actors, and activities in providing humanitarian assistance.  The Administration also believes that section 1082, which facilitates foreign assistance, should be subject to foreign policy direction of the Secretary of State, with input from  USAID.  Section 1083 also appears premature, insofar as section 1082 directs the DOD to review its collaboration with charitable organizations.  Therefore, the Administration objects to section 1083 pending further interagency coordination and internal DOD analysis. Defense Industrial Base: The Administration strongly objects to section 863, which would sunset certain procurement requirements related to sourcing goods exclusively from  the national technology and industrial base.  The existing procurement requirements act as a key guarantor of strategic supply chain security.  They protect DOD\u2019s ability to reliably source goods such as chemical weapons antidotes and components for naval vessels, among others.    Expanding Competition:  The Administration objects to the breadth of section 811, which would grant waiver authority to the Secretary of Defense in expanding competition for DOD contracts where there is only one responsible bidder.  In cases where only one bidder exists, DOD already possesses the necessary capabilities to ensure proper quality and quantity of procured goods, as well as the reasonableness of prices.  This waiver authority, if used to override current Buy American laws, would result in further losses of existing American capabilities and jeopardize American jobs.  To avoid unintended consequences, the Administration urges Congress to narrow the authority by authorizing its exercise only on a case-by-case basis approved by the Secretary and by exempting certain laws from waiver, including, at a minimum, those that impose domestic source  restrictions.   Simplified Acquisition Threshold:  The Administration supports the increase in the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT) that would be provided by section 812, but objects to expansion of the waiver to the Berry Amendment and Specialty Metals requirements whose thresholds are tied to the SAT and would automatically increase if the SAT is raised.  These provisions provide vital protections for American manufacturing and American jobs.  For this reason, the Administration urges Congress to maintain the current threshold for applicability of the Berry Amendment and Specialty Metals requirements.  This would enable agencies and contractors to enjoy the benefits of simpler and less costly transactions made possible by an increase in the SAT without erosion of critical domestic source protections.      Wearable Electronics:  The Administration objects to section 817, which would repeal domestic source restrictions related to wearable electronics.  The Berry Amendment has protected American manufacturing and American jobs since its enactment in 1941.  Wearable electronics are an emerging industry in the United States, and this legislation should not hamstring American capabilities in this young field by allowing it to be opened up for foreign bidding.  The section also should provide a definition of \u201cwearable electronics.\u201d  Congress should also consider whether less intrusive means, such as the availability subsection already encompassed in subsection (c) of the Berry Amendment, are sufficient for the acquisition of wearable electronics.  8   Berry Amendment Exceptions:  The Administration objects to section 865, which would create exceptions to the Berry Amendment under memoranda of agreement with foreign governments. Opening up the end-item  market to foreign competitors could collapse upstream industries in the United States such as weaving, cloth-making, cotton growing, sheep herding, and many others.  It is important to defend the Berry Amendment, which supports American jobs and protects American supply chains.  Civilian Workforce Provisions:  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee did not include the Administration\u2019s proposals to provide for key workforce flexibilities to improve, expand, and harmonize the Federal Government\u2019s efforts to restructure and reshape the Federal workforce.  Many of the proposals enacted in the FY 2017 NDAA, and the Administration\u2019s proposals seek to expand those flexibilities across the Federal Government so that the benefits and impacts of the flexibilities they provide can be used across the Federal civilian workforce.  The proposals aim  to improve the speed and precision with which the Government can hire temporary, term, and student employees; expand access to qualified talent; improve the attractiveness and utility of buyouts as a workforce reshaping tool; and allow for a broader exchange of ideas and talent between the Government and the private sector through industry exchange authority.  We highly encourage Congress to include the Administration\u2019s five proposals because all Federal agencies would greatly benefit from these workforce flexibilities as they seek to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability to the American taxpayer.   Procurement Standardization:  The Administration urges inclusion of the Administration\u2019s proposals to expand to civilian agencies the procurement provisions applied to DOD by the last Congress to standardize basic acquisition procedures and flexibilities across the Federal Government.  Consistent treatment of issues, including task order protests and use of purchase cards, will reduce unintended costs and complications associated with bifurcated acquisition processes.  Constitutional Concerns:  Certain provisions in this bill raise  constitutional concerns.  These include, for example, section 1242, which would interfere with the President\u2019s exclusive authority to recognize foreign nations; section 1265 and 1653, which would interfere with the President\u2019s authority to command the armed forces; and section 1241, which would interfere with the President\u2019s authorities to conduct diplomacy and command the armed forces.  Section 901(e) would contravene the Appointments Clause by authorizing an incumbent official to serve in a new office without further appointment.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns. * * * * * *   9  ", "The Administration also welcomes the Senate\u2019s timely consideration of appropriations legislation, and looks forward to working with the Congress well before the end of the fiscal year to enact individual bills that provide sufficient funding to essential programs without further jeopardizing the Nation\u2019s fiscal state. The Administration is concerned, however, that this combined package is nearly $38 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request, includes certain objectionable policy provisions, and excludes important Administration policy priorities.  Division D exceeds the Administration\u2019s request by $23.5 billion, division A exceeds the Administration\u2019s non-Defense request by $7.6 billion, and division C exceeds the Administration\u2019s request by $6.3 billion.  The Administration recognizes that the problematic spending levels in the bills composing this package stem from the non-Defense discretionary cap set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), about which the Administration has repeatedly registered concern in multiple Statements of Administration Policy and other communications to the Congress since the BBA\u2019s enactment.  In the FY 2019 Budget request, this SAP, and publicly available letters to the Senate Appropriations Committee expressing views on each division of this bill, the Administration has identified numerous reductions and reforms that, if adopted, would bring these bills in alignment with the President\u2019s policies.  The Administration hopes the Congress will consider these suggestions and engage with the Administration to ensure that funding is eventually enacted for the truly essential programs supported by these bills.  As the appropriations process continues, the Administration would like to work with the Congress to identify a path to ultimately enacting non-Defense discretionary spending for FY 2019 below the BBA cap of $597 billion.    The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Senate Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill.  Division A \u2013 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019   Department of the Interior (DOI)  DOI Topline.  The Administration appreciates the support for priority DOI programs, but is concerned that the bill also provides funding in excess of the FY 2019 Budget request for a number of DOI programs.  In total, the bill provides an estimated $13.1 billion for DOI, or $2.4 billion more than the FY 2019 Budget request.  Energy Development.  The Administration applauds the Committee\u2019s commitment to energy development on public lands and in offshore waters, including additional resources for the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.   National Park Service (NPS) Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for NPS construction, and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to address the NPS deferred maintenance backlog.  Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) Closure.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not support the FY 2019 Budget request to begin the process of closing ONHIR, which is on pace to complete relocation activities that began 44 years ago.  It is time to start an orderly transition, which has bipartisan support, by transferring land management functions to DOI.   DOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service  Wildland Fire Management.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s $4.3 billion investment in wildland fire operations, fully funding the 10-year average for wildland fire suppression costs for both USDA\u2019s Forest Service and DOI.  The Administration also appreciates the additional $900 million for suppression operations, $724 million for the Forest Service and $176 million for DOI, to cover suppression costs above the 10-year average, which would help in the year before wildfire cap adjustment funds become available.  Federal Land Acquisition.  The Administration opposes funding provided in the bill for land acquisition, which is $172 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Departments currently manage roughly 700 million acres and have a deferred maintenance infrastructure backlog of over $16 billion.  Acquiring new lands, however, is a low priority.  USDA, Forest Service  USDA, Forest Service Topline.  The Administration is concerned that funding for non-fire programs is nearly $900 million above the FY 2019 Budget request, with large increases for 2   facilities and roads, and for State and Private Forestry grants.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  EPA Topline.  The Administration is concerned that the bill would provide $8.8 billion for EPA, which is $2.7 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request, and includes funding for programs that are outside of the Agency\u2019s core responsibilities.  Funding for Water Infrastructure.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s attention to critical water infrastructure needs through the robust funding provided to both the State Revolving Funds and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act credit program.  Combined, this funding could support several billion dollars in total water infrastructure investment for a wide variety of needs.    Superfund.  The Administration appreciates the $1.1 billion included in the bill for the Hazardous Substance Superfund account, which would support infrastructure projects and ongoing cleanup of contaminated sites that are impacting the health and economic well-being of communities.  EPA Geographic Programs.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides $418 million above the FY 2019 Budget request for the Geographic Programs, which perform local ecosystem protection activities, much of which is more appropriately funded by State and local entities.  Categorical Grants.  The Administration continues to recommend reductions to Categorical Grants, which the bill would fund at $496 million above the FY 2019 Budget request. Reductions to these grants would reduce Federal funding for State activities that go beyond statutory mandates, and would encourage a rebalancing of environmental program funding between Federal and State resources.  EPA\u2019s Science and Technology Account.  The Administration continues to advocate for reductions in the Science and Technology account, which is funded at $706 million or $283 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  This account includes programs in research and development that are not necessary to implement core EPA responsibilities.  Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) Grant Program.  The bill provides $50 million, or $40 million above the FY 2019 Budget request for the DERA grant program.  While the Administration supports limited DERA funding for targeted high-priority projects, DERA projects overlap with other Federal and State programs, and have diminishing returns for older vehicles that would eventually be replaced regardless of DERA grant funding levels.  States may also be able to use some of a $2.7 billion fund established through a settlement with Volkswagen to support very similar projects to those normally funded by the DERA program.   Other Independent Agencies  National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (Wilson Center).  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not eliminate Federal funding for NEA, NEH, and Wilson Center.  3   The Administration recognizes the positive effects the arts and humanities have on our communities; however, the FY 2019 Budget request proposed an orderly phase-out of Federal funding for these agencies, as the Administration does not consider their activities to be core Federal responsibilities.   Division B \u2013 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019   Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The bill provides the IRS a total of $11.3 billion, $128 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  This amount includes $77 million in dedicated funding for tax reform implementation.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for tax reform and the amounts provided in the bill fully fund the Administration\u2019s two-year proposal requested in FY 2018.  Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).  The bill provides TFI a total of $159 million, equal to the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for TFI to continue its critical work safeguarding the financial system from abuse and combatting other national security threats using non-kinetic economic tools.  Treasury Departmental Offices.  The bill provides $209 million for Treasury\u2019s Departmental Offices, $7 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  These additional funds could be used to strengthen review of foreign investment in the United States and address other emerging priorities.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to provide adequate resources to support anticipated increases in the caseload for review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.   Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP).  The bill includes a provision that would allow BEP to acquire land and construct a replacement for its currency production facility in the National Capital Region using its existing resources.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for this proposal which would allow BEP to avoid a costly renovation of its current facility and ultimately lower the operating costs of producing the Nation\u2019s paper currency.  Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The bill provides $250 million, $236 million above the FY 2019 Budget request, for the CDFI Fund.  The Federal Government should not be allocating taxpayer funds to the mature CDFI industry, which should have ready access to private capital.  The requested amount is sufficient to support ongoing CDFI Fund activities, including the New Markets Tax Credit and the zero-subsidy Bond Guarantee Program.  Executive Office of the President (EOP)  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for EOP, including an increase for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the bill does not adequately fund the Information Technology Oversight and Reform (ITOR) account.  To maintain the OMB Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer\u2019s (OFCIO) ability to perform statutorily required IT oversight, policy development, and IT security functions and the U.S. Digital Service\u2019s ability to 4   respond effectively to significant security breaches or recover failed systems, the Administration urges the Congress to fund ITOR at the level requested in the FY 2019 Budget and to support the requested funding necessary to transition certain OFCIO activities to the GSA Office of Government-wide Policy.  The Administration shares the Committee\u2019s goal of ensuring that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has sufficient resources to execute its duties, but is concerned that $2 million of OMB\u2019s appropriation is directed to OIRA in a way that is inconsistent with OMB\u2019s staffing plan for FY 2019 and impinges on the President\u2019s ability to prioritize the work of his staff.  General Services Administration (GSA)  Federal Buildings Fund.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of the Department of Transportation Headquarters purchase and priority renovation projects, and encourages the Congress to fully fund the Federal Buildings Fund at the anticipated level of agency rent collections.   Federal Capital Revolving Fund.  The Administration continues to support the establishment of a Federal Capital Revolving Fund (FCRF), a new budgetary mechanism for large civilian real property projects.  The Administration recently transmitted legislative language and looks forward to working with the Congress to enact the FCRF proposal.   Federal Information Technology (IT) Modernization.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s prior attention to modernizing vulnerable and inefficient legacy IT systems with initial funding provided to the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) in FY 2018, and urges continued support for the TMF in FY 2019 as a means of addressing these pressing challenges.  The bill provides no funding for the TMF, which would halt the Technology Modernization Board's ongoing work to tackle impactful, Government-wide IT modernization efforts.  The Administration believes that any additional funding would be well-utilized and will continue working with the Congress to demonstrate the taxpayer value generated by the TMF.  Environmental Review Improvement Fund.  The Administration is pleased that the Committee fully funds the FY 2019 Budget request for the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, allowing the Council to create a more standardized, coordinated, and predictable permitting process that protects public health, safety, and the environment.  Workforce Fund.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact authorizing legislation to establish the President\u2019s Management Council Workforce Fund and urges the Congress to provide appropriations upon its enactment.  The Administration believes it is essential to develop and fund innovative solutions aimed at recruiting, retaining, and rewarding high-performing Federal employees and those with critical skills sets.  Federal Civil Service  Pay Adjustment.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides an across-the-board pay increase for Federal employees in calendar year 2019.  Across-the-board pay increases have long-term fixed costs, yet fail to address existing pay disparities, or target mission critical 5   recruitment and retention goals.  As proposed in the Administration\u2019s request for a Workforce Fund, the Administration continues to support performance-based pay that is strategically aligned toward recruiting, retaining, and retraining high performers and those in mission-critical areas.  Small Business Administration (SBA)  SBA Disaster Loans Program Account.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides no funding for SBA disaster loan administrative expenses, assuming instead that SBA will rely on balances from appropriations provided in the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-123, division B, subdivision 1).  These balances are necessary to administer loans to those affected by the major hurricanes that occurred in 2017, and may not be sufficient to allow SBA to continue to provide loans to disasters occurring in FY 2019.  The Administration believes it makes sense both fiscally and programmatically to provide funds through the regular appropriations process and ensure that SBA will have the necessary resources to quickly assist homeowners and businesses in disaster recovery.   Other Independent Agencies  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  The bill provides $282 million for the CFTC, consistent with the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support, which would bolster the CFTC\u2019s examination and analysis capabilities and help to address financial technology innovation.  The Administration also proposed legislation authorizing user fees to fund certain CFTC activities, in line with nearly all other Federal financial and banking regulators.  The Administration urges the Congress to adopt this proposal.  Division C \u2013Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019   Department of Agriculture  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Topline.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for select priority programs, but is concerned that the bill also provides funding well in excess of the FY 2019 Budget request.  In total, the bill provides an estimated $20.3 billion for USDA programs funded in the bill, approximately $6.5 billion more than the FY 2019 Budget request.  In addition, the Administration is also disappointed that the bill includes unrequested funding for the Economic Research Service, Foreign Agricultural Service, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the Agricultural Marketing Service.  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).  The bill provides $6.1 billion for WIC and includes a $400 million rescission of unobligated balances.  The Administration appreciates the funding level for the WIC program.  This level is sufficient to serve all projected eligible participants.  6   Competitive Research Grants.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides $405 million for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s premier competitive research program.   National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides funding for the transfer of facility operations from the Department of Homeland Security to USDA, but requests that the special hiring authority provided in the bill include a salary cap.  Rural Business-Cooperative Service.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides $105 million for grants and loan programs for the Rural Business-Cooperative Service.  The FY 2019 Budget request proposes to eliminate these programs as they are duplicative of other Federal funding and have not been successful in improving economic outcomes in rural areas.  Rural Broadband Pilot Program.  Advancing broadband deployment in unserved rural areas is a priority of the Administration.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 recently provided $600 million for this purpose, and USDA is actively implementing the program in conjunction with the private sector.  An additional $425 million as provided in the bill for the same purpose as the $600 million the Congress already provided is premature at this time.  Foreign Agricultural Service.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides $210 million in funding for the McGovern Dole International Food for Education program, which was proposed for elimination in the FY 2018 and FY 2019 Budget requests.  McGovern-Dole has unaddressed oversight and performance monitoring challenges and is duplicative of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Administration appreciates additional funding provided in the bill to support the FDA\u2019s Oncology Center of Excellence, modernize the generic drug development review process, and advance drug development for rare diseases as requested in the FY 2019 Budget.    Other Agencies  P.L. 480 Title II Food Aid (Title II).  The Administration opposes providing food aid funding through use of Title II and prefers that all food aid be provided through the International Disaster Assistance account within USAID.  While the United States is the world\u2019s largest donor of food aid, taxpayers expect such aid to be provided in the most cost-effective manner possible.  Unfortunately, Title II is cost-inefficient, slow, and limits USAID\u2019s ability to use the most appropriate food aid intervention for a particular crisis.  Division D \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019   Department of Transportation (DOT)  Infrastructure Investments.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s strong support for 7   improving the Nation\u2019s infrastructure, consistent with the Administration\u2019s infrastructure priorities.  The bill provides $57 billion in highway, highway safety, and transit formula funds, equal to the authorized fourth year of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act).  In addition, the Administration appreciates the additional $4.8 billion in General Fund budget authority provided for highway, transit, and airport formula programs.  The Administration urges the Congress, however, to support the principles of the Infrastructure Initiative, which seek a more modern approach to investing in the Nation\u2019s infrastructure, by strengthening partnerships between the Federal Government and non-Federal stakeholders, encouraging more non-Federal leadership, and removing barriers to allow non-Federal parties to move forward with projects that they deem priorities.  The Administration believes the bill could do more to promote these principles and would like to work with the Congress to include provisions that support these goals.  Objectionable Competitive Grant Spending.  The Administration opposes the excessive spending the bill allocates to a number of competitive grant programs.  These programs disproportionately allocate funds to projects in States and regions that have the financial wherewithal to provide more support to projects that benefit those areas.  Accordingly, the Administration does not support the bill\u2019s funding levels for: Capital Investment Grants (CIG).  The bill provides $2.6 billion, $1.6 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request for CIG, which proposed to wind down the CIG program by not entering into any additional grant agreements.  The Administration notes that the bill does not contain any authorizing language directing how projects should be evaluated as they move through the CIG statutory process, and the Administration would oppose any effort to insert such language in a final bill. Rail Grant Programs.  The bill provides $565 million for three discretionary grant programs administered by the Federal Railroad Administration, which were not requested in the FY 2019 Budget.  The Administration does not support funding for these programs, which can be addressed with private sector, State, and local support.  In particular, the State of Good Repair program is unnecessary as the main beneficiary of the program\u2014the Northeast Corridor (NEC)\u2014runs through some of the wealthiest states in the Nation that have the resources to invest in the NEC if they so choose.  The Administration appreciates that the bill includes no funding for the Gateway projects, about which it continues to have significant concerns. Essential Air Service (EAS).  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee did not include the Administration\u2019s proposals to reform the EAS program.  The EAS program is in dire need of reform, as total EAS spending has increased 600 percent since 1996, and its per-passenger subsidy costs are $238 on average, with a high of $778 per passenger.  The Administration\u2019s reform proposals would bring spiraling costs under control while ensuring that truly remote communities receive air service.  Amtrak.  The Administration believes that there are real opportunities to make Amtrak a more efficient passenger rail provider, and is encouraged by the performance of Amtrak executive 8  leadership in identifying efficiencies.  The Administration encourages the Congress to support these efforts.  The bill would continue the status quo, unfortunately, providing Amtrak funding equal to the FY 2018 enacted level for all its operations, including its highly inefficient long-distance trains.  BUILD Grants.  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the National Infrastructure Investments (\u201cBUILD Grants\u201d) program, the Administration believes that overly prescriptive project selection requirements, such as the bill\u2019s requirement to award projects based solely on the selection criteria from the 2016 Notice of Funding Opportunity, dilute the DOT\u2019s ability to select the most meritorious grantees and would be particularly harmful and unfair to rural communities.   Pipeline and Hazardous Materials. The Administration objects to language in the bill that would reduce the operational expenses of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) by $100,000 per day if a certain hazardous materials regulation is not completed within 45 days of enactment.  Such a provision will degrade the ability of PHMSA to carry out its mission of ensuring the safety of pipelines and the transport of hazardous materials.   Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Rental Assistance Programs.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides $42.9 billion for HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs, which is $7.1 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request and does not reflect requested legislative reforms.  In April 2018, the Administration released its Making Affordable Housing Work Act, which would give assisted families a simpler and more transparent set of rent structures to reduce administrative burden, incentivize work, and place HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs on a more fiscally sustainable path.  Proposed Grant Eliminations.  The Administration urges the Congress to eliminate the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), the HOME Investment Partnerships program, and the Choice Neighborhoods program, as proposed by the FY 2019 Budget request. The CDBG program is not well-targeted to the most distressed areas and has not demonstrated a measurable impact on communities.  The Administration also believes that State and local governments are better positioned to comprehensively address community revitalization needs as well as the unique local market challenges and impediments that lead to housing affordability problems.  In total, these eliminations would save $4.8 billion in FY 2019, which could be directed to higher priority needs.  Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  Some provisions would contravene the separation of powers between the executive branch and the Congress.  In particular, certain provisions\u2014including one purporting to bar OMB from expending funds to alter the annual work plan of the Army Corps of Engineers\u2014would interfere with the President\u2019s supervision of the executive branch.  Others would require congressional committee approval of certain Executive actions, in violation of INS v. Chadha, or could infringe on the President\u2019s constitutional authority to control the disclosure of information that is subject to Executive 9   privilege.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2019 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  10   ", "The Administration strongly supports H.R. 3004, Kate\u2019s Law.

The alleged shooter, Francisco Sanchez, was an illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times and had seven felony convictions.  H.R. 3004 would increase the penalties that may be imposed on criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry, deterring reentry and keeping criminal aliens off our streets.  The bill is consistent with the Administration's broader efforts to strengthen enforcement of our immigration laws and improve the security of our Nation's borders.

The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested.  The rule  imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.    H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. Reg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize regional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for activities on public lands.  The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located mostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy and mineral development.  Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes the rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities\u2019 interests and could potentially dilute their input in planning decisions.  H.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act \u2013 Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86076 (Nov. 29, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education.  This rule establishes requirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have an accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student success, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student progress.  While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local control of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas where the ESSA intended broad flexibility.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they implement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  H.J. Res. 58 would nullify the final rule related to the Teacher Preparation Program Accountability System, 81 Fed. Reg. 75494 (Oct. 31, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education.  This rule establishes annual State reporting to measure the performance and quality of teacher preparation programs and tie them to program eligibility for participation in the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program.  The rule imposes new burdensome and costly data reporting requirements on States and institutions of higher education.

The bill would expand existing Federal criminal law pertaining to certain crimes targeting law enforcement officers.  By permitting the Federal prosecution of individuals who knowingly cause serious bodily injury to a law enforcement officer, or attempts to do so, H.R. 5698 would help protect the courageous men and women of law enforcement who put their lives on the line every day to keep us safe.  Individuals who commit such crimes would be subject to imprisonment for up to 10 years.  The penalty would increase if the offense results in the death of a law enforcement officer or includes a kidnapping, or an attempt to kill or kidnap.  The Administration stands with the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs Association, and the Sergeants Benevolent Association in recognition and appreciation of the unwavering dedication and service of law enforcement officers to the Nation and the American people.

While the Administration supports this short-term extension of FAA authorities ahead of their scheduled expiration on September 30, 2017, it strongly urges the Congress to continue working toward modernization of our outdated air traffic control system.  Specifically, the Administration supports legislation introduced by House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA), which would separate our antiquated air traffic control (ATC) service from the Federal Government and create a not-for-profit entity to finally help modernize our ATC system. H.R. 3823 would also provide targeted tax relief for taxpayers impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.  In addition to supporting these tax relief measures, the Administration will submit further requests to the Congress for supplemental funding in the near future, and looks forward to working with Congress to enact these recovery measures into law.   The Administration strongly supports the inclusion of H.R. 1422, the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act, which would clarify that privately-issued flood insurance policies satisfy mandatory purchase requirements, and would allow a property owner with a private policy to meet continuous coverage requirements for the purpose of re-enrolling in a subsidized Federal plan.

The Administration\u2019s second disaster funding request, submitted to Congress on October 4, 2017, underscored this belief.  The request also noted the Administration\u2019s belief that land management reforms are critical to solving the problem of \u201cfire borrowing\u201d -- taking funds from  forest management programs to cover fire costs that exceed appropriations -- in a comprehensive manner, rather than through a funding-only approach. The Administration appreciates the intent of H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of  2017, and is supportive of land management reforms like those outlined in the legislation.  The Administration, however, has concerns about the legislation\u2019s revisions to the Stafford Act, which would force competition for funding between wildfires on Federal land and other disasters already covered by the Stafford Act, including hurricanes. Wildland Fire Management Funding Last year, Federal wildfire suppression spending reached $2.9 billion, an amount that signals clearly the need for Congress to address the rising cost of fire suppression operations.  The dependence on \u201cfire borrowing\u201d to cover funding shortfalls in times of severe wildfire impedes the missions of our land management agencies, including by taking critical funding from programs that help reduce the risk of catastrophic fire, restore and maintain healthy functioning ecosystems, and yield timber production. The Administration, however, has concerns with re-purposing the Stafford Act to address wildfires.  The purpose of the Stafford Act is to assist State, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments that become overwhelmed when responding to and recovering from natural disasters affecting their jurisdictions.  H.R. 2936 would modify the Stafford Act by creating a new type of disaster declaration to address the cost of wildfire suppression on Federal land, thereby changing long-standing principles governing Federal support to SLTT governments.  As we have seen in this year\u2019s historic Atlantic hurricane season, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must continue to be focused on its existing mission, and the Stafford Act\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund must remain dedicated solely to that mission.   Instead of the approach outlined in H.R. 2936, the Administration supports a separate, annual cap adjustment for wildfire suppression operations, which will resolve concerns about the sufficiency of funds for wildfire suppression and avoid unnecessary competition for Stafford Act funds. Improving Forest Management   The Administration appreciates H.R. 2936\u2019s recognition that fixing the funding component of fire borrowing will not, on its own, stop the worsening trend of catastrophic wildfires.  Meaningful forest management reforms to strengthen our ability to restore the Nation\u2019s forests and improve their resilience to destructive wildfires must be a part of any permanent solution.  H.R. 2936\u2019s provisions that expedite environmental approval for proactive forest management, including hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire timber salvage and reforestation actions, are important steps forward.  The Administration supports and will continue to work with Congress on the details of the forest management reform proposals.  \u00a0Although the Administration has concerns with H.R. 2936\u2019s modifications to the Stafford Act, the Administration will continue working with Congress to enact a sustainable solution to \u201cfire borrowing\u201d that does not adversely affect FEMA\u2019s critical disaster relief funding and that recognizes the need for a comprehensive solution to the problem of wildfires.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.J.

The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the House Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill. Department of Defense (DOD) Military Personnel and End Strength.  The U.S. military\u2019s greatest asset is the men and women who volunteer to serve.  The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the requested 2.6 percent military pay raise as well as the FY 2019 Budget request to rebuild the military by increasing end strength to 1,338,100 Active Component and 817,700 Reserve Component members.  Littoral Combat Ship.  The Administration urges the Congress to limit the funding level to $647 million in FY 2019 to procure only one Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).  There is no requirement for an additional two LCSs in FY 2019 at a cost of $950 million.  One LCS in FY 2019, when combined with the three LCSs funded in FY 2018 and the three funded in FY 2017, would keep both shipyards supplied with ample work to remain viable for the U.S. Navy Next Generation Frigate FFG(X) Program competition.  It is imperative that we take the lessons learned from the LCS program and move on to providing a more capable and survivable ship to meet the Navy\u2019s  needs, consistent with National Defense Strategy (NDS) priorities. Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) Recapitalization.  The Administration strongly believes the JSTARS recapitalization program does not meet the needs of the warfighter across the full spectrum of conflict and investing in the Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) is prudent and better postures DOD for future warfighting environments.  DOD is moving away from its previous aircraft-centric approach to JSTARS recapitalization and urges the Congress to support DOD\u2019s new, more survivable, net-centric approach.  The old, aircraft-centric JSTARS recapitalization program will be unable to perform its mission in high-end contested environments, which is counter to the NDS.  Therefore, the Administration objects to the addition of $623 million to fund that program, and to making the divestment of current JSTARS aircraft contingent on its funding.  In order to address sensing and command-and-control requirements across the full range of military operations, resources would be better utilized to invest in ABMS.    Reductions to Operations and Maintenance Accounts.  The Administration appreciates the funding the Committee provided to restore readiness in FY 2019, which supports the NDS to build a more lethal force.  The Administration strongly objects, however, to the $3 billion reduction to the Services\u2019 Operation and Maintenance (O&M) accounts.  These reductions negate the Committee\u2019s otherwise clear intent to support defense readiness, and would directly and negatively impact key readiness priorities including depot maintenance, base operations support, communications, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization.  The reductions to Defense-wide O&M would negatively impact readiness enablers supporting the military services and the Defense Health Program\u2019s medical services for service members and their families.  Consistent with the NDS objective to reform DOD business practices, the FY 2019 Budget request already contains reductions in the O&M account of over $450 million for prior-year underperformance; these funds were realigned to support other NDS priorities. Financial Assistance for Palau.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s ongoing support for the 2010 Palau Compact Review Agreement (CRA), which enables the United States to fulfill its financial commitment to the Republic of Palau in FY 2018.  Consistent with the CRA, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to include DOD\u2019s requested provision in FY 2019 that would provide the authority for DOD to offset costs associated with Palau\u2019s acquisition of private land for new U.S. defense sites to install critical defense assets.  Multiple Munitions Reductions.  The Administration appreciates the overall support for preferred munitions provided in the bill, which directly supports the NDS to build a more lethal force.  The Administration objects, however, to the bill\u2019s nearly $245 million in reductions to munitions across multiple procurement appropriations.  The FY 2019 Budget request continues increased procurement of preferred and advanced munitions, a necessity due to ongoing operations in the Middle East and the need for war reserves.  DOD still has shortfalls in preferred munitions needed to achieve successfully the operational plans identified in the NDS; the AIM 120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM), and the Tomahawk missile are all significant contributors to increasing DOD\u2019s lethality and warfighting capability that would be detrimentally impacted by these reductions. 2  C-135B (Open Skies Treaty Aircraft).  The Administration objects to the elimination of$222 million in procurement funding for the C-135B.  The Air Force requires the full fundinglevel requested in the FY 2019 Budget to recapitalize its existing fleet of 1960s-era OC-135BU.S. Open Skies Treaty (OST) observation aircraft with modern, capable, and cost-effectivereplacements.  Currently, the United States is not able to fully exercise its rights under OSTbecause some airfields covered by OST are not accessible to the current OC-135B aircraft.Reporting Requirements Related to Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI).  The acceleration of cloud technologies is critical to developing technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.  In order to maintain our military advantage, DOD will responsibly leverage foundational infrastructure and platform technologies from the commercial sector.  The Administration recognizes the importance of proper congressional oversight and appreciates the Committee\u2019s interest in and support for these efforts, but is concerned that language in section 8130 of the bill is overly prescriptive and creates a burdensome reporting requirement.  DOD is committed to continuing to work with the Congress to address concerns and enable oversight while balancing the requirement to deliver new capabilities to the warfighter.  Israeli Cooperative Programs.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the FY 2019 Budget request of $500 million for Israeli Cooperative Programs, consistent with the U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding.Constitutional Concerns Certain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns, including with respect to the President\u2019s authority as Commander in Chief.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2019 appropriations process moves forward. * * * * * * *3  ", "The Administration supports House passage of S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer  Protection Act.  The bill is consistent with the Administration\u2019s core principles for regulating the United States financial system set forth in Executive Order 13772.  Specifically, the bill would advance the principles of:  (1) fostering economic growth; (2) making regulation efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored; and (3) empowering Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the marketplace. S. 2155 builds on the legislative foundation established by a series of bills passed by the House of Representatives with strong, bipartisan support, including H.R. 389, the Credit Union Residential Loan Parity Act; H.R. 1699, Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act; H.R. 2133, the CLEARR Act; H.R. 2226, the Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Act; H.R. 2255, the Housing Opportunities Made Easier Act; H.R. 2683, the Protecting Veterans Credit Act; and H.R. 3221, Securing Access to Affordable Mortgages Act.  The bill also includes a variety of provisions from bipartisan Senate bills, including S. 223, the Senior$afe Act of 2017; S. 1002, the CLEAR Relief Act; S. 1139, the Main Street Regulatory Fairness Act; S. 1310, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act; S. 1753, the SAFE Transitional License Act; and S. 1751, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act.  S. 2155 contains commonsense reforms that will improve consumer access to credit, tailor regulations to better fit our diverse financial system, and provide enhanced protections to consumers and veterans.  It reforms regulations governing mortgage lending to facilitate prudent lending by community banks and credit unions to prospective homebuyers.  It also helps nonprofit organizations such as Habitat for Humanity continue their missions of expanding homeownership by allowing them to accept donated appraisal services.  S. 2155 streamlines regulations for credit unions and community and regional banks, reducing unnecessary regulatory costs and making it easier for them to serve their customers without creating risks to the financial system.  Although the Administration prefers a risk-based approach to systemic risk regulation, S. 2155 provides a reasonable alternative in raising from $50 billion to $250 billion the threshold for the application of enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve.  The new threshold, along with the bill\u2019s other supervisory reforms, will further tailor regulation to the nature of the risks presented by different institutions and help allocate more regulatory resources toward the institutions that present the greatest risks to the financial system.  Further, these provisions are an important step in addressing the  Administration\u2019s concerns that excessive regulation provides a competitive advantage for the largest institutions and fosters excessive concentration in the banking industry.  The  Administration notes that Federal banking agencies retain their authority to address any risks to safety and soundness that may emerge with institutions that fall below the new threshold.  The Administration also notes that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has the authority to increase risk-based deposit insurance premiums to address new risks, if any, arising from the threshold to ensure that there are no net costs to the FDIC.    The Administration is committed to consumer protection and ensuring that consumers have the tools needed to manage their finances in the manner that best suits their own personal needs and financial goals.  Accordingly, the Administration supports section 301 of the bill that gives consumers the ability to place security freezes on their credit files with credits bureaus.  This provision will empower consumers to protect their credit in the event of future data breaches or incidents of identity theft.  The Administration further supports the bill\u2019s enhanced protections for our Nation\u2019s veterans with respect to the excluding of certain medical debt from consumer report information.      The net impact of this legislation will be to foster economic growth by expanding prudent lending, reducing regulatory costs, and strengthening the ability of consumers to protect their credit records, while ensuring the proper oversight and regulation of the financial system.    The Administration is grateful to Senator Mike Crapo, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, and Congressman Jeb Hensarling, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, for their tireless work on this legislation to improve the regulation of community banks and credit unions, protect our financial system, and create the conditions for robust economic growth.   If S. 2155 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend he sign the bill into law.    * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration supports H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017.  Many Americans have seen their health insurance premiums increase, and healthcare options decrease, significantly under the Affordable Care Act.  The Administration supports efforts to restore competition to the health insurance marketplace in order to lower costs and expand choices for consumers.   H.R. 372 would amend the McCarran-Ferguson Act to ensure that Federal antitrust laws apply to the business of health insurance.  The bill supports the goal of giving American families and businesses more control over their own healthcare choices by promoting greater health insurance competition.  The bill would specifically prohibit businesses from engaging in anti-competitive practices, including price fixing, bid rigging, and market allocation that could drive up healthcare costs.   If H.R. 372 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.                * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration appreciates the funding in this bill to support execution of the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy, as well as the Nuclear Posture Review, South Asia Strategy, and vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region.  The Administration also welcomes the Senate\u2019s timely consideration of appropriations legislation, and looks forward to working with the Congress well before the end of the fiscal year to enact individual bills that provide sufficient funding to essential programs without further jeopardizing the Nation\u2019s fiscal state. Division B invests in the health, education, and job skills of the American people.  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of funding for priorities such as anti-opioid programs, charter schools, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, and apprenticeship grants, as well as the bill\u2019s support for efforts to combat improper payments and maintain program integrity.  However, the bill does not include \u2013 and in some case precludes \u2013 numerous Administration proposals to reduce spending and improve program effectiveness found in the FY 2019 Budget\u2019s Major Savings and Reform volume.  The Administration appreciates that division A is generally consistent with the FY 2019 Budget request topline level.  Division B, however, exceeds the Administration\u2019s request by $11.8 billion.  The Administration recognizes that the problematic spending levels in division B stem from the non-Defense discretionary cap set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), about which the Administration has repeatedly registered concern in multiple SAPs and other communications to the Congress since the BBA\u2019s enactment.  In the FY 2019 Budget request, this SAP, and publicly available letters to the Senate Appropriations Committee expressing views on each division of this bill, the Administration has identified numerous reductions and reforms that, if adopted, would bring these bills into alignment with the President\u2019s policies.  The Administration hopes that the Congress will consider these suggestions and engage with the Administration to ensure that funding is  eventually enacted for the truly essential programs supported by these bills.  As the appropriations process continues, the Administration would like to work with the Congress to identify a path to ultimately enacting non-Defense discretionary spending for FY 2019 below the BBA cap of $597 billion.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Senate Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill.  Division A \u2013 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019  Military Pay Raise.  The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the FY 2019 Budget request for a 2.6 percent military pay raise.  Strategic Forces.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s robust support for the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review and the FY 2019 Budget request for operations, sustainment, and recapitalization of U.S. strategic nuclear forces.   Ground Combat Investments.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s robust support of Army and Marine Corps ground investments.  The bill provides $12.5 billion, including Armored Brigade Combat Teams and amphibious ground combat systems, which provide critical support in furtherance of National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy (NDS) objectives.  Israeli Cooperative Programs.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the FY 2019 Budget request of $500 million for Israeli Cooperative Programs, consistent with the U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding.    Financial Assistance for Palau.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s ongoing support for the 2010 Palau Compact Review Agreement (CRA), which has enabled the United States to fulfill its financial commitment to the Republic of Palau in FY 2018.  Consistent with the CRA, the Administration strongly urges the Congress to include the provision requested in the FY 2019 Budget that would provide the authority for DOD to offset costs associated with Palau\u2019s acquisition of private land for new U.S. defense sites to install critical defense assets.   Littoral Combat Ships (LCS).  The Administration strongly objects to the provision of an additional $475 million above the FY 2019 Budget request for the procurement of a second LCS.  The additional ship is not needed.  One LCS in FY 2019, when combined with the three funded in FY 2018, would keep both shipyards supplied with enough work to remain viable for the Frigate competition.  It is imperative that, based on lessons learned from the LCS program, a more capable and survivable ship is developed to meet the Navy\u2019s needs, consistent with NDS priorities.  Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle.  The Administration strongly objects to the elimination of $209 million in launch funding for the Space Test Program-4 mission.  The Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites payload is an innovative public-private partnership to demonstrate on-orbit repair, refueling, and other servicing capabilities.  This satellite will be available for launch in spring 2021, which requires the procurement of its launch vehicle in FY 2019.  Failure to do 2   so would lead to significantly increased program costs for satellite storage and program support, and puts at risk substantial private investment and future public-private partnerships.   Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF).  The Administration objects to the $532 million reduction to the ASFF.  With the President\u2019s South Asia Strategy at a critical juncture, this reduction would jeopardize the ability of the Afghanistan National Defense and Security Forces to maintain a security environment that supports upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections and achieve political reconciliation with the Taliban. Reduced funding specifically risks undermining:  1) the combat effectiveness of the Afghan National Army; 2) the ability of the Afghan National Police to effectively implement the Kabul Enhanced Security Zone; 3) the continued modernization of the Afghan Air Force; and 4) the continued expansion of the Afghan Special Security Forces.  Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria Train and Equip Fund (CTEF).  The Administration objects to the FY 2019 CTEF reduction of $406 million.  This reduction would inhibit DOD\u2019s ability to ensure a lasting and complete defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), executed as part of DOD\u2019s by, with, and through strategy.  The primary defeat mechanism in the fight against ISIS are U.S. partner forces in Iraq and Syria.  Fully equipping and training these partner forces is critical to maintain campaign momentum against ISIS and its threat networks.  If funding is reduced to the level in the bill, DOD would be significantly degraded in its ability to:  1) complete the materiel provisioning of the border guard forces to secure the western border of Iraq; 2) provide the necessary mobility and lethal equipment sets for local security forces to strengthen the security of liberated provinces; 3) build the capability of Peshmerga to conduct wide area security; 4) support the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service with the necessary modern equipment to sustain the pressure on ISIS threat networks; 5) resource emerging requirements to support Syrian Democratic Forces offensive operations against remaining ISIS forces; and 6) support building the capacity of internal security forces to stabilize a post-ISIS Syria and prevent an ISIS reemergence.  Security Cooperation Funding.  The Administration objects to the $150 million reduction to the security cooperation Overseas Contingency Operations request.  Funding security cooperation at a level below the FY 2019 Budget request would force the cancellation or delay of critical security cooperation programs supporting the NDS line of effort to strengthen alliances and attract new partners.  Defense Information Systems Agency\u2019s National Background Investigation System (NBIS).  The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s $60 million reduction to NBIS, which would undermine the Administration\u2019s efforts to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal background investigation process.  The reduction would delay NBIS\u2019s deployment from FY 2019 to FY 2020, and undercut DOD\u2019s efforts to assume the National Background Investigation Bureau mission.  The reduction would also limit DOD\u2019s ability to integrate capabilities that are critical to reducing the background investigation backlog, such as continuous evaluation, biometrics and fingerprinting, automated records checks, and case management.  End Strength.  The Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the request to increase end strength to 1,338,100 Active Component and 817,700 Reserve Component members.  One of the 3   primary objectives of the FY 2019 Budget request, which fully aligns with the National Defense Strategy, is to invest in DOD\u2019s most important asset: people.  Failure to fund the necessary end strength growth could impose critical delays on efforts to improve readiness by increasing manning levels to reduce personnel and operational tempo, as well as to generate expanded ability for full-spectrum training opportunities.  Division B \u2013 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019  Department of Labor  Apprenticeship.  The Administration strongly supports the continued funding for the Department of Labor\u2019s apprenticeship grant program.  These grants would help to expand the use of apprenticeship as a tool for cultivating a skilled workforce in businesses across the Nation.  The bill maintains language, however, preventing the Department from spending funds to provide a streamlined, employer-driven approach to establishing high-quality apprenticeship programs.  Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments (RESEA).  The Administration strongly supports the bill\u2019s funding for RESEA in accordance with the BBA.  RESEA is an evidence-based intervention that reduces improper payments in the Unemployment Insurance program while getting claimants back to work more quickly and at higher wages.  Protecting Union Members.  The Administration strongly objects to the lack of increased funding for the Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS).  The increase is necessary to restore OLMS\u2019s investigative workforce, which the previous administration allowed to fall by one-third during the past 10 years.  The FY 2019 Budget request strengthens protections for transparency for union members by supporting more audits and investigations to uncover flawed officer elections, fraud, and embezzlement.  International Labor Affairs Bureau (ILAB).  The Administration strongly objects to the bill\u2019s continued funding for ILAB\u2019s grants, which the FY 2019 Budget request proposed to eliminate.  Many of ILAB\u2019s grants are awarded non-competitively and spent on activities that are of questionable utility and where there is not a clear Federal role.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  Child Care.  The Administration appreciates the support provided for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, which helps families access child care so they can work, go to school, or enroll in a job training program.  Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s continued support of program integrity in health programs and the flexibility the bill provides to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to focus funding on the most valuable program integrity efforts and areas of greatest need.  Opioid Abuse and Mental Health Funding.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides 4   funding to address opioids and mental health, most notably the $1.5 billion provided for State grants to address opioid abuse.  National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consolidations.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not consolidate the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research activities in NIH, as requested in the FY 2019 Budget.  Further, the bill includes funding in excess of the request for NIOSH, AHRQ, and NIH, totaling $4.7 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration strongly supports actions that reduce overlap in Government programs and increase efficiency, and looks forward to working with the Congress to achieve these goals.  Indirect Cost Policy.  The Administration is disappointed by the continued inclusion of language in the bill (section 226), which prohibits changes to the method NIH uses to pay grantee institutions for administrative and facilities costs.  In addition, the Administration strongly opposes any attempts to prohibit NIH or any other Agency staff from developing strategies to make Government programs more effective and efficient.  21st Century Cures Act Research Policy Board.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not authorize the use of NIH funding to establish and operate the 21st Century Cures Act Research Policy Board, as requested in the FY 2019 Budget.  Further, the indirect cost policy provision noted above makes it difficult to address regulatory burden in a meaningful way.  As a result, the Administration will not be able to establish the Research Policy Board as directed by the Congress.  Health Professions Training Programs.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill provides unrequested funds for health professions training programs.  The bill provides $643 million, which is $555 million more than included in the FY 2019 Budget request.  Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) program.  The Administration opposes the bill\u2019s inclusion of $101 million in unrequested funds for the TPP program.  The TPP program began in FY 2010 to provide competitive grants to replicate successful TPP approaches, test new TPP approaches, and identify the effectiveness of these interventions.  The TPP program serves less than one percent of teenagers in the United States.  Although the teenage pregnancy rate has declined significantly, the evidence suggests that TPP has not been a major driver in that reduction.   Department of Education  Charter Schools.  The Administration appreciates the funding provided in the bill for the Charter Schools Program, which is generally consistent with the FY 2019 Budget request.  This funding supports the opening, expansion, and replication of charter schools as well as helps charter school operators access high-quality facilities.  Unnecessary Department of Education Programs.  The Administration is concerned that the bill funds 28 programs that the Administration has proposed for elimination in the FY 2019 Budget 5   request.  Eliminating these programs, which are duplicative, narrowly-focused, or unable to demonstrate effectiveness, would save nearly $6 billion in FY 2019.   School Choice.  The Administration opposes the lack of funding for Opportunity Grants.  The FY 2019 Budget requested $1 billion in funding to empower more families to choose the best private or public school for their children.  Student Aid Administration.  The Administration objects to the funding level for Student Aid Administration which is $93 million below the FY 2019 Budget request.  The requested increase is needed to service an ever increasing volume of Federal student loans, improve cybersecurity, and protect the data of 40 million Americans with student loans.  The Administration also strongly opposes a provision in the bill under the Student Aid Administration heading that would constrain the Department of Education\u2019s authority in awarding a new servicing contract.  The provision would require significant change to the Next Generation Processing and Servicing Environment procurement, increasing the discretionary cost of Federal student loan servicing, and severely restricting the Department of Education\u2019s ability to provide a consistent and improved borrower experience.   Expansion of Public Service Loan Forgiveness.  The Administration opposes the wasteful $350 million funding level for a temporary benefit in the Federal Direct Student Loan program that expands Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility.  In contrast, the Administration proposes to eliminate the PSLF program, which unfairly favors certain career choices over others, and instead focuses assistance on undergraduate student borrowers from all professions through a single income-based repayment plan.  Social Security Administration (SSA)  Limitation on Administrative Expenses.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for SSA, including its full funding of program integrity activities to ensure that only eligible individuals receive Social Security benefits.   Other Independent Agencies  National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  The Administration opposes the $274 million funding level for the NLRB, which is substantially more than the President\u2019s FY 2019 Budget request.  NLRB caseload and activities have declined markedly over recent decades, while funding levels have increased.  The NLRB can fulfill its important mission of protecting workers\u2019 statutory rights to join, or refrain from joining, labor organizations at lower funding levels.  The Administration requests transferring at least $6 million from NLRB to OLMS within the Department of Labor, an office that also protects workers\u2019 associational rights and whose inadequate funding levels impair its ability to perform its mission.    Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  Such provisions would contravene the separation of powers between the executive branch and the Congress.  In particular, these 6   provisions would require congressional committee approval of certain executive actions, in violation of INS v. Chadha.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2019 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  7   ", "The Administration supports House passage of S. 204, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, which will increase access to unapproved, investigational treatments for patients with terminal illnesses.  S. 204 would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to create a new, alternative pathway for a broad range of patients diagnosed with life-threatening diseases or conditions.  Far too many patients in our country are faced with terminal illnesses for which there are no treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or for which they have exhausted all approved treatment options.  Biomedical research into treatments for debilitating and deadly diseases, including clinical trials, while proceeding faster than ever, may nonetheless take too long to help patients who are currently sick and may soon die.  The Administration believes that these patients and their families should be able to seek access to potentially life-saving therapies while those treatments are still under review by the FDA.   Since the late 1980s, FDA has facilitated access to investigational drugs, devices, and biological products for the treatment of seriously ill patients.  Families in these situations have sometimes found this process challenging, and FDA is constantly striving to make improvements to its expanded access program.  Some patients and their families, however, still have challenges accessing investigational treatments. The Administration believes that treatment decisions for those facing terminal illnesses are best made by the patients with the support and guidance of their treating physicians.  This legislation will advance these principles.  If S. 204 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s provision of much-needed funding for our military, including approximately $21 billion of the requested $30 billion additional in appropriations that the President submitted to the Congress in March 2017.  These funds would accelerate the President\u2019s campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, as well as support ongoing efforts to rebuild and modernize the U.S. Armed Forces.  By providing these funds without a corresponding increase in lower priority non-defense funding, this bill rejects the \u201cparity\u201d construct that for years has jeopardized critical increases in defense spending. In total, the bill represents a $25.7 billion increase in Department of Defense funding over fiscal year (FY) 2016 levels. The bill increases end strength by adding 24,000 active-duty forces and 12,000 selected reserve forces above the previous Administration's request for FY 2017.  It also invests in both near and long-term readiness, provides direct support to our warfighters through new and improved equipment, and increases pay for our troops.  In FY 2018, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to increase overall defense funding by fully eliminating defense sequestration in a fiscally responsible manner. While the Administration will continue to push for additional funding to stop human and drug trafficking, interdict violent gangs and cartels, and support other enforcement priorities, the bill is a good first step, and does make available an additional $1.5 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. Further, the total funding provided for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement is $18.5 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over FY 2016. The Administration is also concerned that the Congress did not exercise fiscal restraint, as it failed to include responsible reductions to non-defense discretionary spending to offset higher spending elsewhere. The Administration is also disappointed that this bill provides almost $300 million for Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicaid program without underlying reforms to Puerto Rico\u2019s struggling healthcare system, which, like so many aspects of the United States healthcare system, has been badly damaged by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  The Administration believes that any sustainable solution to Puerto Rico\u2019s dire fiscal situation must include the enactment of pro-growth policies for the island.   The Administration strongly supports the inclusion of the District of Columbia Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Reauthorization Act, which delivers on the President\u2019s promise to provide school choice. The Administration also supports the various provisions in the bill that continue protections for the sanctity of life and the Second Amendment. More generally, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to return to regular order for the FY 2018 appropriations process, and to enacting legislation that reflects the President\u2019s priorities to keep our Nation safe and create jobs and prosperity for American workers. If the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 were presented to the President in its current  form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.  * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act.  Consistent with President Donald J.

This bill would make needed updates to the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), primarily by establishing \u201cSchedule A\u201d as a new drug schedule.  Schedule A would consist of substances that are analogues of certain substances already controlled by Schedules I through V of the CSA.

H.R. 6199 would promote a consumer-driven healthcare approach and furthers the Administration\u2019s commitment to expand access to higher quality and more affordable healthcare for millions of Americans. H.R. 6199 would expand the ways that people could use and benefit from HSAs.  H.R. 6199 would remove the counterproductive ban on HSA enrollment for those who have a spouse enrolled in a health Flexible Spending Account.

The amendment would require that Federal Government outlays not exceed receipts in any year unless authorized by legislation passed by three-fifths of the House and Senate.  The amendment would impose similar supermajority requirements for legislation increasing the limit on Government debt held by the public, and would require any legislation increasing revenues to be approved by majority roll-call votes.  Finally, the bill recognizes the importance of exceptions for spending in times of military conflict.  In his Fiscal Year 2018 and 2019 budget proposals, President Donald J. Trump has proposed trillions of dollars in spending reductions to non-defense programs that would reduce our deficits and debt, while ensuring that our military has the resources it needs to keep our Nation safe.  These reductions eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse, and abolish numerous programs that have failed to deliver promised outcomes to the American people. While President Trump recently signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Omnibus), into law in order to secure a much-needed historic investment in our military and other priorities, such as rebuilding our infrastructure and combatting the opioid crisis, the Administration strongly believes that the non-defense discretionary spending in the Omnibus demanded by some members of Congress is a threat to the fiscal stability of our Nation.  Instead of raising taxes on the American people to pay for more Government spending, the Administration believes we should put in place long-term constraints on the growth of Government. In addition to supporting H.J.

The Administration welcomes the House\u2019s timely consideration of appropriations legislation, and looks forward to working with the Congress well in advance of the end of the fiscal year to enact individual bills that provide sufficient funding to essential programs without further jeopardizing the Nation\u2019s fiscal state. The FY 2019 Budget request, as amended, accounts for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA\u2019s) new Defense and non-Defense discretionary spending caps for FY 2019.  The Administration strongly supports the overall Defense levels included in the BBA.  However, given the Nation\u2019s long-term fiscal constraints and the need to right-size the Federal Government, the Administration does not support the BBA\u2019s non-Defense cap of $597 billion, $57 billion above the FY 2019 Budget. The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill. Division A \u2013 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 Corps of Engineers Agency Topline.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s investments in the Nation\u2019s water resources through the Corps of Engineers civil works program.  However, the Administration also believes the bill should encourage a more modern approach to investing in the Nation\u2019s infrastructure that would strike an appropriate balance in incentivizing and facilitating greater non-Federal participation in water resources projects while maintaining robust support for infrastructure where Federal investment is most warranted and needed. Department of Energy Nuclear Posture Review (NPR).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for modernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, recapitalization of the associated  infrastructure, strengthening nuclear nonproliferation and nuclear counterterrorism efforts, and the Naval Nuclear Propulsion program.  The bill funds the foundational aspects of the NPR\u2019s critical programs and activities at requested levels.  Plutonium Infrastructure.  The Administration objects to the establishment of a new construction project at Los Alamos National Laboratory for capital improvements and equipment installations beyond ongoing work in Plutonium Facility 4.  Designating this program scope as a new line item is not in accordance with department orders on project and program management, would add cost and time to execute, and would greatly increase risk to meeting the 30 pit per year goal by 2026.  Office of Science.  The Administration supports funding basic research and development (R&D).  However, the bill provides $6.6 billion for the Office of Science, $1.2 billion more than the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration urges restraint in funding these programs.  Applied Energy Programs.  The Administration believes the bill provides excessive funding for the Department\u2019s applied energy programs.  The bill provides $4.2 billion for these programs, $2.4 billion more than the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration encourages the Congress to restrain funding levels in these programs and focus resources on early-stage R&D across the applied energy technology spectrum rather than late stage or near commercial ready technology.   Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).  The Administration believes that the continued funding of ARPA-E makes little strategic sense given the existence of applied energy research elsewhere within the Department.  The Congress is urged to eliminate ARPA-E and incorporate its more successful elements, such as coordination with industry and cross-cutting research, into the Department\u2019s applied energy programs.  Loan and Loan Guarantee Programs.  The bill maintains the Title XVII Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, and the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program.  In the FY 2019 Budget request, the Administration proposed eliminating these programs and funding only the minimum administrative expenses necessary to monitor the existing portfolio.  The Congress is encouraged to adopt the elimination proposals to recognize the private sector\u2019s primary role in taking risks to finance projects in the energy and automobile manufacturing sectors.  Department of the Interior  Bureau of Reclamation.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s investments in the Nation\u2019s water resources through the Bureau of Reclamation.  However, the Administration also believes the bill should encourage a more modern approach to investing in the Nation\u2019s infrastructure that would strike an appropriate balance in incentivizing and facilitating greater non-Federal participation in water resources projects while maintaining robust support for infrastructure where Federal investment is most warranted and needed.    2   Division B \u2013 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2019  House and Joint Items.  The Administration recognizes that the Legislative Branch needs adequate funding to maintain operations and ensure the safety and security of Members of Congress, their staff, and visitors.

Division C \u2013 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019  Department of Defense  Unrequested Reprioritization of Military Construction Funding.  The Administration objects to the bill\u2019s realignment of requested military construction funding from priority projects to other unrequested projects.  Contrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible full funding policy, the bill instead proposes to incrementally fund 12 military construction projects, effectively passing the required $900 million amount needed to fully fund the projects to future year budgets.  Further, the bill diverts almost $1 billion from the projects requested for full funding, or from rescissions of prior year funds, to other unrequested projects.  Many of these unrequested projects are not ready for construction due to the lack of planning and design and are not included in the Department of Defense\u2019s Future Years Defense Program.  By incrementally funding military construction projects to fund unrequested projects, the bill delays critical resources to complete high-priority projects that would be initiated in FY 2019 and puts the burden on future budgets to make up the difference.  Detention Facilities at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for military construction of a high-value detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.  Department of Veterans Affairs  Veterans Affairs (VA) Funding.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided $85.3 billion in discretionary funding, $3.9 billion above the FY 2018 enacted and equal to the FY 2019 Budget request.  Veterans Community Care Programs.  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee has not accepted the Administration\u2019s proposal to fully fund Veterans Community Care resource requests with discretionary funding, subject to annual appropriations.  Although the FY 2019 Budget requested $1.9 billion in discretionary funding to continue the Choice program that this Appropriations Act does not provide, the Administration acknowledges that the MISSION Act provided that funding in mandatory resources.  Furthermore, since the Administration expected the MISSION Act to be in place by the beginning of FY 2018, the delay in enacting the MISSION Act\u2019s new community care program increases the requirements to continue VA\u2019s current, traditional community care program by an additional $1.6 billion in FY 2019. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to secure this funding within the existing non-defense discretionary cap.  3    VA Electronic Health Record.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for the $1.2 billion requested in the FY 2019 Budget to continue the implementation of VA\u2019s new electronic health record (EHR).  Having veterans\u2019 complete and accurate health information in a single common EHR system is critical to patient care and safety.  This new EHR system would enable VA to easily adopt improvements in health information technology and cyber security that the current system, VistA, is unable to incorporate.  VA Capital Infrastructure Programs.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for a combined total of $4.9 billion for three VA capital programs (major construction, minor construction, and non-recurring maintenance), roughly $1.5 billion above FY 2018 enacted, and $1.9 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request.  Medical Accounts Merger.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not merge, as outlined in the FY 2019 Budget request, the Medical Community Care and Medical Services accounts within the Veterans Health Administration.  The separate appropriation for community care has restricted VA\u2019s ability to efficiently manage its budget at the local level and make decisions about whether care is provided in VA\u2019s own facilities or is purchased from community providers or Federal partners.  Healthcare delivery is a dynamic situation, and merging the two accounts would maximize VA\u2019s ability to focus its resources on the services veterans need most, while providing the Congress the transparency desired to monitor spending.  Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, certain sections would interfere with the President\u2019s constitutional authority and duty to protect national security, as well as his authority as Commander in Chief.  Certain other provisions would contravene the separation of powers.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns.

H.R. 1215 would limit non-economic damages to $250,000 and limit the fees lawyers may charge in a healthcare lawsuit.  The bill would also impose a three-year statute of limitations on such lawsuits.  H.R. 1215 would apply to healthcare lawsuits where coverage was provided through a Federal program, subsidy, or tax benefit.  The bill reflects a reform proposed in President Trump\u2019s Fiscal Year 2018 budget. In addition to the provisions in H.R. 1215, the President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget proposal would also modify the collateral source rule to allow evidence of a claimant\u2019s income from other sources to be introduced at trial.  The proposal would provide a safe harbor for providers based on defined clinical standards; authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide guidance to States to create expert panels and administrative healthcare tribunals; and exclude provider expressions of regret or apology from evidence in a healthcare lawsuit.

The regulations required by Obamacare and finalized in December 2014 present some implementation challenges to our Nation's businesses, which can threaten economic growth and local job creation.  H.R. 772 would roll back yet another overreaching Obamacare regulation and offer a smarter, more targeted approach to ensuring that consumers have access to nutritional information. Obamacare regulations represent an approach that fails to fully account for customers' preferences in ordering food and deprives businesses of the flexibility and protection they need to meet the needs of their customers.  H.R. 772 limits liability in a way that would protect American businesses against unfair lawsuits.  Further, it would modernize menu labeling by allowing businesses to provide information in the most useful way to customers, recognizing that Americans order food in the 21st century by phone, online, using mobile apps, and in person.  In addition, by minimizing time-consuming paperwork requirements and providing sufficient opportunity to correct violations, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2017 will save American businesses from Obamacare's heavy-handed statutory framework.  Businesses have to begin complying with the menu labeling requirement on May 7, 2018\u2014only three months away\u2014at a time when significant questions remain and businesses are facing the burden of implementation.  The Administration strongly supports providing relief and protection to America's restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, and other food sellers.  If H.R. 772 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2017, and applauds the House of Representatives for its efforts to protect Medicare beneficiaries and the American public at large from the harmful effects of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). While Medicare is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory and needs reform, the IPAB, as enacted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), represents government overreach that circumvents the normal legislative process. As envisioned, the IPAB's fast-track procedures would allow a politically unaccountable board to undertake major changes to the Medicare program without appropriate control by the Executive, thereby undercutting our system of constitutional self-government.  The President's Fiscal Year 2018 budget eliminated the IPAB, and we encourage the Congress to follow suit and swiftly pass H.R. 849. The Administration also encourages the Congress to continue working to repeal and replace other harmful components of the PPACA.  If H.R. 849 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of S.J.Res. 34, which would nullify the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s final rule titled \"Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunication Services,\" 81 Fed. Reg. 87274 (December 2, 2016).  The rule applies the privacy requirements of the Communications Act of 1934 to broadband Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and other telecommunications carriers.  In particular, the rule requires ISPs to obtain affirmative \"opt-in\" consent from consumers to use and share certain information, including app usage and web browsing history.  It also allows ISPs to use and share other information, including e-mail addresses and service tier information, unless a customer \"opts-out.\"  In doing so, the rule departs from the technology-neutral framework for online privacy administered by the Federal Trade Commission.  This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor. If S.J.Res. 34 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.* * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports H.R. 6311, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act of 2018.  This commonsense package of healthcare reforms would give Americans greater ability and incentive to save for healthcare expenses.  It would allow them more control over how to spend their resources to best improve their healthcare and health and it would lower insurance premiums for millions of Americans.   Combined with a qualifying health plan, health savings accounts (HSAs) are proven tools to reduce health care costs by better engaging consumers in their health care decisions.  H.R. 6311 would allow more Americans to obtain greater benefit from HSAs, by raising contribution limits, allowing working seniors enrolled in Medicare Part A to contribute to an HSA, and permitting HSAs to be paired with Obamacare bronze and catastrophic plans.  This bill would also allow people to roll over a greater amount of Flexible Spending Account contributions, reducing wasteful end-of-year healthcare spending. Insurance options have dwindled and premiums have soared as a result of Obamacare.  H.R. 6311 also would take concrete steps to lower health insurance premiums by providing relief from Obamacare\u2019s tax on health insurance plans and increasing access to lower-cost plans.  The bill is consistent with this Administration\u2019s commitment to give back greater control over healthcare choices to American patients and families. If H.R. 6311 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. ** * * * * * ", "The Administration supports the House amendment to the Senate-passed H.R. 695, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes. This legislation provides  the resources the military needs to keep the Nation safe, and is consistent with the President\u2019s pledge to undo the looming defense spending reductions that are harmful to America\u2019s national security and military readiness. This bill includes a total of $659 billion  for the Department of Defense (DOD), including $584 billion in base spending and $75 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.  The bill supports a total funding level for DOD similar to that authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2018, which was signed into law by the President. The U.S. military\u2019s greatest asset is the men and women who volunteer to serve.  This bill keeps faith with service members by providing a 2.4 percent military pay raise.  It increases end strength across the military services for active duty, reserve, and National Guard personnel, and includes funding for training and maintenance to ensure that United States troops are properly equipped and ready to fight. The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of the remaining $1.2 billion of the request in H.R. 695, to support increased troop levels in Afghanistan, special operations forces capabilities, and other urgent needs.  This amount is consistent with the budget amendment that the Administration submitted to the Congress on November 6, 2017. In addition to supporting H.R. 695, the Administration will continue to support a responsible two-year budget agreement that ensures critical defense funding without holding it hostage to arbitrary demands for lower-priority domestic programs. If H.R. 695 were presented  to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. Constitutional Concerns Certain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these concerns. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2018 appropriations process moves forward. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration appreciates the continued work of the House Armed Services Committee (Committee) on behalf of our national defense. The annual National Defense Authorization Act  (NDAA) is an essential  step in securing the Nation, and the  Administration supports  ultimate  passage of an NDAA for the 57th consecutive year.  The  Administration  appreciates  the  bill\u2019s  provisions  that enable  implementation of the  National Security Strategy and the  National Defense Strategy, both of which focus on a return to principled realism  in an era of great power competition. The bill\u2019s overall authorizations of  base national defense funding and Overseas Contingency Operations funding are  consistent  with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the FY 2019 President\u2019s Budget request.  Further, the  bill  authorizes funding and supports  our efforts to destroy the remaining forces of  the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), rebuild readiness, execute  the Administration\u2019s  South Asia  Strategy, deter potential  adversaries, and bolster  our allies. The bill also supports  the Administration\u2019s requested  pay raise, military end-strength levels, and many of the Nuclear  Posture Review initiatives. It also  includes  important reforms to Department of  Defense  (DOD)  management and business practices.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress  to address its  concerns, a  number of which are outlined below. The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the  classified annex  to the  committee report and working with Congress to address any concerns  about classified programs.  Roles of Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy (USD(P)) and Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence (USD(I)).  The  Administration strongly objects to section 904(b), which would transfer  certain technology protection functions related to export controls  from the USD(P) to the  USD(I).  The  USD(P)  plays the lead role within DoD on ensuring that defense cooperation with foreign partners protects sensitive United States  technologies  and aligns  with National  Defense Strategy priorities.  Technology security and export  control  activities directly support political-military relationships, security cooperation efforts, and  multilateral non-proliferation  export control activities.  Technology security arrangements  negotiated and implemented by  the Defense Technology Security Agency  in support of defense cooperation activities are  worked in close coordination with the Department of State and other departments and agencies  in the interagency.  The  USD(P) is the principal representative of  DoD in the interagency and  to the State Department.  1     Detention Facilities at Naval Station  Guantanamo Bay. The Administration strongly objects to the absence  of the authorization for  military construction of  a High-Value Detention  Facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.  The President  has ordered continued detention operations at  Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.  The current facility for high value detainees is experiencing  structural and system failures that, if  unaddressed, could in the future pose life and safety risks  to our guard forces and the  detainees being held there; it also does not meet the requirements of the  aging detainee population.  Repeal of Certain Determinations Required for Grants of Exceptions to  Cost or Pricing Data  Certification Requirements and Waivers of Cost Accounting Standards.   The Administration  strongly objects  to section 877, which would permit the waiver of the requirement to submit  certified cost and pricing data without first establishing that the data cannot be obtained from  the contractor when needed at the contracting officers\u2019 request to support  a price  reasonableness determination.  Section 877 would place contracting officers at  a significant  disadvantage in negotiating fair and  reasonable prices,  resulting in increased cost  to the taxpayers and the Department.  Advisory Boards Regarding Military Commissaries and Exchanges. The Administration strongly objects to section 624, which would establish an advisory board consisting of  military service  organization or veteran service organization representatives at each installation with either a  commissary or exchange. This provision is duplicative of established advisory and feedback channels.  The Department estimates this provision would establish approximately 255 new  advisory boards and increase costs to DOD by at least $145 million annually.  In addition, many remote and overseas  locations do not have appropriate military service organizations  or veteran  service organizations, or represent  the primary customers at these locations.  Background investigation and security clearance-related provisions.  The Administration  strongly objects  to section 1626, which would prohibit  the obligation or  expenditure of FY 2019 funds to transfer the background investigation mission from the National  Background Investigations Bureau to DOD  before December 31, 2019.  The Administration is committed to  achieving an efficient, fiscally viable, and secure  background investigations operation, and looks  forward to discussing its  plan to  reform this critical mission with the Congress.   The  Administration also objects to sections 541, 1622, 1623, 3111, and 3112, which pertain to the  processes for conducting, reviewing, and adjudicating the security clearances of dual citizens and of personnel convicted of certain offenses. These provisions interfere with the governance  structure for policy and oversight of the government\u2019s security clearance  programs, duplicate  existing policy, and would likely limit clearance  reciprocity.  Additional  Requirements for Negotiations for Noncommercial Computer Software. The  Administration supports the general  preference for negotiating specialized software licenses.   However, the Administration strongly objects to section 871, which would prohibit DOD from  requiring minimum license rights that are necessary to protect  critical DOD operational and  mission needs, including emergency repair activity, utilizing Modular  Open Systems  Approaches  in the Development of Weapon Systems (required by 10 U.S.C. 2446a), and mitigating   2   cybersecurity vulnerabilities or other  supply chain risks.  Limitation Pending Certification on the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System  (JSTARS) Recapitalization Program.   The Administration objects  to section 214, which would restrict the obligation of funds for the Advanced Battle-Management System (ABMS) and reduce DOD\u2019s  proposed divestment of legacy E-8C aircraft until the Secretary of the  Air Force  certifies that the JSTARS  recapitalization program is proceeding unhindered with the  plan in the  President\u2019s  2018 Budget request.  The JSTARS recapitalization  program will be  unable to perform its mission in high-end contested environments, which is counter to the National  Defense Strategy.   As such, the Administration strongly believes the JSTARS  recapitalization  program does not meet the needs of the  warfighter across the  full spectrum of conflict and that investing in ABMS is prudent and better postures DOD  for the future warfighting environments.  Open Skies Treaty.   The Administration objects to the elimination of the  $222.2 million FY 2019 funding request in section 4101 for the C-135B as \u201cahead of need.\u201d The Air Force expects to be in  a position to execute  this procurement and requires the FY 2019 funding to replace the existing fleet of 1960s-era OC-135B U.S. Open Skies Treaty (OST) observation aircraft with modern, capable, and  cost-effective aircraft.   At present,  the United States  is not able to fully  exercise its  rights under  the OST as some Open Skies airfields are not  accessible to  the  current  OC-135B  aircraft.   The Administration also objects to section 1232, which would tie U.S. votes on Treaty decisions at  the Open Skies Consultative Commission (OSCC) to the completion of an unrelated  certification.    Unfunded Navy Ships.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for increasing the size of the fleet and  shares the Committee\u2019s desire to increase our submarine and carrier force.   However, the Administration objects to specific  provisions  which may inadvertently restrict the  ability to  invest in our fleet in a  responsible  and sustainable manner.  For instance, section 130 prohibits the Navy from  fully exercising the FY 2019 Virginia-class submarine (SSN) five-year  multi-year procurement authority until the Navy  certifies it will procure two  more SSNs than are  currently in the  budget.  In addition, section 122(b) provides incremental funding authority over  an indefinite period for  CVN-81 as well as CVN-80, which is inconsistent with acquisition best  practices.  Additionally,  section 121 increases the requirement for operational aircraft carriers from 11 to 12, which may not be sustainable within the Navy\u2019s current topline.  The  Administration looks forward to working with Congress to determine the  most cost-effective and  fiscally responsible path forward to deliver the Navy the Nation  needs.  Missile Defense. The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for enhancing the  Nation\u2019s missile defense system.  However, the  Administration has concerns with sections 1661 and 1662 as  currently written.  The Administration believes it  is premature to mandate specific solutions while the Department continues to evaluate the best technical and fiscal approaches.   The Administration will work with Congress to  ensure that the Nation is provided with an  enhanced, layered missile defense that  is  appropriate, affordable, and sustainable, consistent with the forthcoming Missile Defense Review.  Limitation on Availability of Funds for Army Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor.   The  Administration objects to section 1668.  The inability to obligate fifty percent of Army Lower  Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor program funding will limit the Army\u2019s ability to  meet the desired  accelerated initial operating capability  (IOC) timeline.   The Administration also objects to    3   the requirement in section  1668 to submit a report that contains a funding profile and  schedule to ensure that such sensor  would achieve IOC by December 31, 2023.  Principal Advisor on Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction.   The Administration objects to section 1072, which would require the Secretary  of Defense to designate a Principal  Advisor on  Countering  Weapons of  Mass Destruction  (CWMD) with responsibility  to  supervise activities  across the Department.   On April 9, 2018, the Deputy Secretary directed the establishment of a  CWMD  Unity of Effort Council.  The Council will expeditiously address issues that affect the CWMD mission.  Sanctions  Relating to Russia.  The Administration has taken numerous actions against Russia as well as Russian corporations and individuals, in response to their wide  range of  malign activities, including  continuing to occupy Crimea and instigate violence  in eastern Ukraine, supplying the  Assad regime in Syria with material  and weaponry as they bomb their own citizens, attempting to subvert Western democracies,  and malicious cyber activities. Even as these actions are enforced,  the Administration appreciates that section 1236 would provide some additional flexibility in granting waiver relief from certain Russian-related sanctions  under the Countering America\u2019s  Adversaries  Through Sanctions Act, which are  required for persons engaging in significant  transactions with Russian defense and intelligence sectors and which could ensnare key  United States  partners and allies should they so engage  to support  their defense  requirements.   As  expressed  in the joint letter from Secretary Mattis and Secretary Pompeo to the key House committees and leadership on May 8th, the Administration seeks adequate flexibility to avoid inadvertent  damage to our efforts to build and sustain key relationships with allies and partners. As United States  allies and partners support  United States  national  security activities  while they  transition to non-Russian systems, it is important that waiver relief for this purpose be  included in this legislation.  Minimum Confinement  Period for Convictions of Certain Sex-related Offenses Committed by  Members of  the Armed Forces.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s continued focus  on DOD\u2019s efforts to eliminate harassment and sexual assault.   However,  the  Administration objects  to section 531 because it  is contrary  to established  Federal practice and, given the broad scope of  sex-related  offenses in the military justice system,  would likely adversely impact the interests of  justice, including those of crime victims.   This change discourages offers to plead guilty and takes  away flexibility from a General Court-Martial Convening Authority and prosecutors.   Authorities and Responsibilities of the Chief Management Officer  (CMO) of the Department of  Defense.   The Administration objects to  expanding the CMO\u2019s authority, direction, and control  with respect  to all the Defense Agencies and DOD Field Activities.   Section 911 would create  contradictory and conflicting authorities  and relationships between the CMO and Office of the  Secretary of Defense (OSD) Principal Staff Assistants.   While the Department  appreciates the congressional intent,  the CMO has all of the necessary authorities required to oversee efficiency  and effectiveness related to the business aspect  of covered activities.   Transition of Certain Defense Agencies and Department of Defense Field  Activities.   The  Administration objects to  directing  the Department to transfer all information technology  contracting, acquisition, and senior  leader communication services of the  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to other DOD elements.  This action would increase the cost of  acquiring information technology, weaken the Department\u2019s  ability to secure its cyber    4   networks, and inhibit DISA\u2019s  mission to provide  seamless communication to warfighters and senior  leaders.  The Administration also urges Congress to include the  Washington Headquarters Services in the review  of all the Defense Agencies and DOD Field Activities directed in  section  913(c)  instead of eliminating it as section 913(b)  directs.   Improvements to Acquisition System, Personnel, and Organization of Space Forces.   The  Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s continued focus and attention as it  executes its oversight responsibilities of our nation\u2019s military space capabilities and forces.   However, the  Administration believes that section 1601 is premature.   The Department currently is  conducting a review of  its space organizational and management structure as required by section 1601 of the FY 2018 NDAA.   Once complete,  the Administration  will review these findings  and  deliver the required report  and consult with Congress.  Cloud Services.   The acceleration of cloud technologies  is critical to developing technologies such  as artificial  intelligence and  machine  learning.  In order to maintain our military advantage, the  Administration will responsibly leverage foundational  infrastructure and platform technologies  from the  commercial  sector.  The Administration looks forward to providing the  information requested in section 1053 to both enable proper congressional oversight and prevent delays  in the  delivery of new capabilities to  the warfighter.  Plan for Elimination or Transfer of the Strategic  Capabilities  Office (SCO) of the Department of  Defense.   The Administration objects to section 218, which would require DOD to develop a  plan to eliminate or transfer the SCO.   The Administration views the SCO\u2019s work as critical to  maintaining our advantage over our  strategic competitors and is concerned that  its  elimination and transfer  of functions would place  our operating forces at  risk.  Defending United States Government Communications.   The Administration  supports the  general approach of  section 880.  However, we are concerned about the  unintended consequences of  such a broad prohibition.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to ensure the scope of the  provision both protects our national security and maintains  our ability to execute our mission.  Transition of Administration by Defense Health  Agency (DHA) of Military Medical  Treatment  Facilities (MTFs).   The Administration supports language  in section 711,  which would permit  phasing the transfer of the administration and management of MTFs from the Services to DHA  over a two-year period.  However, the Administration objects to language that would prohibit the  Secretary of Defense from closing any MTFs, limit the health  services provided by an  MTF, or  take any action to begin such a closure or limitation until  after the  transition.  The Administration  also  objects to  section 721, which would create a TriService Dental Research Program at the Uniformed  Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), since a TriService Center of Oral  Health Studies already exists at USUHS and the center could broaden its research role.    Per Diem Allowance Policies.   The Administration objects to section 605, which would prevent  the Secretaries of the military departments from implementing a reduced per diem for uniformed Service members and civilian employees who travel to one  location for more than 30 days. This  provision  is unnecessary because DOD has already implemented a policy allowing the Services to  pay travelers\u2019 actual expenses up to  the full per diem rate when the reduced flat rate for meals and  incidental  expenses is insufficient for the assignment.     5   Military Housing Privatization  Initiative (MHPI).   The Administration objects  to section 604, which would require the Secretary to pay lessors  of covered housing five  percent  of the basic allowance for  housing (BAH) amount.  While the section\u2019s  intent is to ensure that  MHPI  project entities are able to sustain and recapitalize privatized family housing, the  United States  government does not have the authority to mandate how  these  entities manage increased  payments.  Section 604 also would effectively provide financial support  to MHPI project entities  that  is not afforded to other private entities that have service member tenants, creating different  housing standards for military families living in  private housing on an installation compared to those  living off-installation.  This provision would  cost as much $200 million in FY 2019 and more than $1 billion over the next 5 years  to subsidize privatized family housing, which would divert resources critical  to build a more lethal, resilient, agile, and ready Joint Force.  Finally,  it is  not  possible for  DOD  to  make monthly payments, except  in arrears, because of the time and  complication involved in establishing the amount owed under the provision.  Unrequested Re-prioritization of Military Construction Funding.   The Administration objects to the  bill\u2019s realignment of requested military construction funding from priority  projects to  other unrequested projects.  Contrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible full funding policy, the  bill  instead proposes to incrementally fund 12 military construction projects, effectively passing the required $900 million amount needed to fully fund the projects to future year budgets. Further, the bill diverts almost one billion dollars from the projects requested for full funding, or from  rescissions of prior year funds, to other unrequested projects.   Many of these unrequested projects  are not  ready for construction due  to the lack of planning and design and are not  included in DOD\u2019s Future Years Defense Program.   By incrementally funding military construction projects to fund unrequested projects, the bill delays critical resources to  complete high-priority projects  initiated in FY 2019 and puts the burden on future budgets  to make up the difference.   Improvements to Research and Development and Acquisition  Processes of Missile Defense  Agency (MDA).   The Administration objects to section 1663(c), which would require  MDA  to publicly release the quarter and fiscal year execution of planned  missile defense flight  tests.  Due to the need to safeguard critical  defense information, DOD no longer  discloses the dates and times of missile defense flight tests prior to  the required  safety notifications.  The  Administration also objects to section  1663(b), which  imposes  a 180-day waiting period to implement improvements to non-standard acquisition processes  and restricts changes to  requirements generation processes.  Provision of Space Situational Awareness Services and Information.  The Administration  objects to section 1603, which would terminate  DOD\u2019s authority to provide space situational  awareness data to commercial and foreign entities on January 1, 2024, and require the  Secretary of Defense to enter  into a contract with a federally funded research and development  center to assess which department or  departments should assume these authorities.   This  would interfere with ongoing Executive Branch efforts, including efforts led by the Vice President as Chair of the National Space Council.   As noted by the Vice President during his  speech at the Space Symposium on April, 16, 2018, the National Space  Council  staff is  coordinating  a space traffic management policy for the President\u2019s approval which already addresses roles and responsibilities for space situational awareness data and space traffic management services.   The policy  establishes a partnership between the Departments of  Defense and Commerce with Defense maintaining the authoritative catalog and Commerce serving as the civil agency public  interface.      6   Limitation on Availability of Funds for Joint Space Operations Center Mission System.   The  Administration objects to section 1609, which would restrict all funding for the Joint Space  Operations  Center Mission System, and funding for the Enterprise Space  Battle  Management  Command and Control program to 75 percent of the funds made available  for FY 2019 until  the  Deputy Secretary of Defense certifies to the congressional defense committees that  the Secretary of  the Air Force has entered into a contract  to provide existing best-in-breed commercial space situational awareness processing software.  This  provision will add additional cost and schedule  to both programs and delay delivery of a critical space situational awareness capability  to the warfighter.  Designation of Navy Commanders.   The Administration objects to section 905, which would require the Secretary of the Navy to designate a single commander within the Department of the  Navy responsible for ensuring Navy forces are available for tasking and deployment, including those forces  that may be operating from a forward deployed location.   This section would also designate a single commander to oversee all shipyards, including those overseas.  These provisions would intrude on the authority and the prerogative of the Secretary of the Navy to manage the  organization to provide the best support  to  the Secretary of Defense and the President.   Surface Warfare Officers (SWOs) Career Paths.   The Administration objects to section 502, which would establish a specialized  career path for SWOs.  Separating SWOs into two career  paths would  limit mastery  of core skillsets that are fundamental in developing a warfighter  to lead, fight, and operate complex U.S. Navy warships.  Pursuant to critical  lessons-learned from  the 2017 Strategic Readiness Review and Comprehensive Review, the introduction of new  classroom courses, enhanced simulator training, and frequent career milestone evaluations  strengthen the core skillsets required for every SWO, and optimizes the development,  assessment, and sustainment of proficiency across the SWO  career path.   Purchase of Vessels Using Funds in National Defense Sealift Fund. The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support in section 1022 of the Department\u2019s efforts to recapitalize  the Ready Reserve Force and the U.S. Navy\u2019s Military Sealift Command (MSC) surge fleet by increasing the amount of used foreign-built vessels authorized for purchase.  However, the  Administration objects to withholding 25 percent  of MSC\u2019s funds in FY 2019 as restrictions  on funding will limit MSC\u2019s ability  to support worldwide sealift and other ongoing operations  (replenishment of U.S. Navy vessels at sea, oceanographic survey and surveillance, expeditionary sea bases for SOF,  mine counter measures,  and special mission support).  National Guard Promotion Accountability.   The Administration objects to section 513.   By  mandating an effective date of promotion after Federal Recognition based upon the actions of a  Governor of a  State, the  provision infringes on the authority of the President and Secretaries of  military departments to  appoint officers in the National Guard of the United States, which is part  of the military\u2019s Reserve Component.  This provision would result  in inequitable treatment  among National Guard officers and similarly situated Regular Army, Regular Air Force, United States Army  Reserve, and United States Air Force Reserve officers who are also  subject to  review before their appointment is tendered.  Unjustified Reductions  to Operational and Personnel Accounts.   The Administration objects to reducing certain operation & maintenance  and military pay accounts by $2.6 billion based on prior-year under-execution in those accounts.   If enacted, these reductions would be applied to critical    7   programs, such as Military Services\u2019 readiness, depot maintenance, base operations support, and military pay  and allowances for Service members.   Reducing these programs  would directly impact  the lethality and readiness of DOD, undermining the National Defense Strategy.  Dual Status  Military Technicians.   The Administration objects to section 506, which would guarantee Title 5 employment to any dual status  technician (National Guard or Reserve) who loses their position \u201cfor  any reason other  than disqualification.\u201d   The Administration is  concerned that this section, as currently worded, would create an unlimited obligation to provide  Title 5 positions to military technicians who simply abandon their military  memberships, retire  militarily, or are released from  military service due to force-shaping measures or administrative discharges.   Limitations on Authority to Revoke  Certain Military Decorations Awarded to Members of the  Armed Forces.   The Administration objects to section 571 because it infringes on the  Service  Secretaries' authority to  revoke certain military decorations awarded to Service members in order to preserve  the prestige and integrity of  these  awards.  This provision would also be inconsistent  with sections 3744, 6249, and 8744 of title 10, United States  Code, which prohibit  an award to a member  whose service has not been honorable.   Accelerating Payments.   The Administration strongly supports improved cash flow to small  businesses and small business subcontractors, but  has concerns regarding the extent to  which the accelerated  payment actions required by section  852 will achieve tangible benefits for small business subcontractors.   Because payment practices are industry specific, the benefits of an  across-the-board acceleration of payment by the government to large business prime contractors  is  unlikely to produce in-kind benefits for small business subcontractors, but  will create new costs for  the Department to monitor and enforce, and could create other unintended consequences for the  Department in ensuring payment integrity.      Transition Assistance Program.   The  Administration objects to  section 552, which would replace  the current requirement for all Transitioning service members  to participate in the Department of  Labor Employment  Workshop (DOLEW) by limiting required instruction related to employment to only one day, instead of the three days in the current Transition Assistance Program (TAP).   Such prescriptive  legislation is premature and would restrict the Administration\u2019s flexibility to shape  TAP based on the needs of the participants  and findings of ongoing analysis and evaluation.  Coast Guard Contracting. The Administration objects to section 3523, which would create a  wholly new contract requirement that applies only to the Coast Guard and is outside of general  government requirements under the  FAR by requiring Coast Guard contracting officers to include  new clauses  in future contracts to prepare for potential terminations.  This section  is unnecessary  and duplicative.  Workforce Issues for Military Realignments in the Pacific.   The Administration appreciates the important authorities enacted last year in the FY 2018 NDAA, which authorize  admission before  October 1, 2023 of H-2B workers in  the region  to  perform certain military-related work  necessary for the relocation of Marines to Guam  on planned timelines.   Section 1043 extends  exemption from the nation-wide cap on H-1B and H-2B workers for Guam and the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands  and adds health care workers as exempt from H\u00ad2B requirements that the  work be temporary in nature.   The Administration urges the Congress to    8   focus on the Administration\u2019s 2018 requested authorities and fully adopt them to address  specified needs in both Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.  Procurement of Ammonium Perchlorate and Other Chemicals for Use in Solid Rocket Motors.   The Administration  is concerned by the fragile state of the defense industrial  base for  many specialty chemicals that  are required for, sensitive technologies.   The Administration supports efforts to  ensure that  the materials and  chemicals needed for weapon systems are secure and reliable.   The Administration therefore strongly supports Section 1682, which directs the  Secretary of the Army to explore  the  possibility of using a government-owned, contractor-operated model to securely supply specialty chemicals to the Department of Defense for warfighter needs.    Prohibition on Acquisition of Sensitive Materials from Non-Allied Foreign Countries.   The  Administration strongly supports section 873, which directs the Secretary of Defense  to purchase, to  the maximum extent possible, rare earth permanent magnets and certain tungsten, tantalum, and molybdenum products from sources other  than China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.  The  global markets for rare earths and tungsten are currently dominated by China, which has pursued an aggressive strategy  to control the  supply of these critical materials, resulting  in the loss of  American jobs and technology.  This section demonstrates that the United  States will seek  alternate sources of supply when foreign nations seek to unfairly disrupt a  marketplace in pursuit  of economic and military advantages at variance with  the  strategic interests  of the United States.   * * * * * * *     9   ", "The Administration strongly supports S. 2311, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,and applauds the Senate for continuing its efforts to secure critical pro-life protections.S. 2311 would generally make it unlawful for any person to perform, or attempt to perform, anabortion of an unborn child after 20 weeks post-fertilization, with limited exceptions.  The bill, if enacted into law, would help to facilitate the culture of life to which our Nation aspires.  Additionally, the bill would promote a science-based approach to unborn life, as recent advancements have revealed that the physical structures necessary to experience pain are developed within 20 weeks of fertilization.  The United States is currently out of the mainstream in the family of nations, in which only 7 out of 198 nations allow elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.  America\u2019s children deserve the stronger protections that S. 2311 wouldadvance.  If S. 2311 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommendthat he sign the bill into law. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations.  The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on States, local communities, and institutions of higher education.  H.J. Res. 42 would nullify the Employment and Training Administration's Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Labor.  The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested.  The rule  imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.    H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. Reg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize regional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for activities on public lands.  The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located mostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy and mineral development.  Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes the rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities\u2019 interests and could potentially dilute their input in planning decisions.  H.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act \u2013 Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86076 (Nov. 29, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education.  This rule establishes requirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have an accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student success, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student progress.  While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local control of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas where the ESSA intended broad flexibility.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they implement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  H.J. Res. 58 would nullify the final rule related to the Teacher Preparation Program Accountability System, 81 Fed. Reg. 75494 (Oct. 31, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education.  This rule establishes annual State reporting to measure the performance and quality of teacher preparation programs and tie them to program eligibility for participation in the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program.  The rule imposes new burdensome and costly data reporting requirements on States and institutions of higher education.    If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law.    ", "The Administration strongly supports H.R. 4909, the Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act of 2018, and urges the Congress to approve this legislation.  H.R. 4909 would help school personnel and law enforcement personnel identify and prevent violence in schools.  The bill authorizes $500 million for State-based grants, administered by the Department of Justice, to support evidence-based violence-prevention programs in every middle and high school across the country.  These grants would support a range of pro-active strategies for identifying and preventing school-targeted violence, including evidence-based training, anonymous reporting systems, threat assessments, intervention teams, and increased coordination between schools and local law enforcement.  The programs that these grants support will provide significant improvements to school security. The President\u2019s top priority is to keep the American people safe from those who wish to do them harm or to inflict terror upon them.  The Administration supports legislative efforts to protect the most vulnerable in our society, especially children.  The Federal government is uniquely positioned to identify and share best practices or reform opportunities with States that would deter and prevent violent crime in our schools and communities.   It is critical that the Congress work to secure our schools; to strengthen our laws to aid in law enforcement; to improve treatment for individuals struggling with serious mental illness, especially those who pose an imminent threat to themselves and others; and to better coordinate with States to improve existing programs and practices.  H.R. 4909 is a good step that would be improved by eliminating the restriction on the use of funds to provide firearms training for those in a position to provide students with appropriate, armed defense. If H.R. 4909 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, and appreciates the work of House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway (R-TX) and Members of the House Agriculture Committee to pass a farm bill in a manner that provides certainty to our Nation\u2019s farmers, ranchers, and foresters and enacts common-sense work requirements as part of the overall requirements for eligibility for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.  The Administration believes that work reforms like those in H.R. 2 are a critical component of any multi-year farm bill reauthorization. Since taking office, President Trump has made modernization of our Nation\u2019s antiquated welfare system a priority.  Through the Executive Order entitled \u201cReducing Poverty in America by Promoting Opportunity and Economic Mobility,\u201d issued on April 10, 2018, the President has placed an emphasis on ending dependency and promoting work\u2014goals that will ultimately benefit millions of Americans.  To that end, by including strong work requirements for able-bodied participants in SNAP, H.R. 2 takes a major step toward the President\u2019s vision of welfare reform.  These reforms would require adult SNAP participants who are able to work to do so.  It would also provide services that help individuals find work and encourage self-sufficiency.  In contrast to previous farm bills that have contained minimal reforms to SNAP work requirements, H.R. 2 is clearly a step toward meaningful welfare reform.  The Administration also appreciates that the bill contains many of the SNAP recommendations from the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2019 Budget, including fixing SNAP eligibility loopholes that allow individuals with assets or incomes above the intended limits to participate.  We look forward to continued discussion about ensuring that increases to earned income deductions do not expand eligibility to households that are not already eligible. Additionally, the Administration appreciates that the bill reduces overly generous payments for participating in the Conservation Reserve Program, eliminates the Conservation Stewardship Program, and pursues management and regulatory reforms on public lands. The Administration would like to highlight several concerns with H.R. 2.  The Administration believes the bill should not increase spending over the five-year authorization or the ten-year baseline of the bill.  The Administration is also concerned that the bill does not include additional reforms to improve the cost-effectiveness of farm and conservation programs that were proposed in the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2019 Budget.  The Administration would support a reform of the Title II food aid program through the farm bill that would maximize resources in responding to global food crises and promoting food security.    The Administration supports a multi-year farm bill that provides long-term certainty to rural America and promotes regulatory and spending reforms across farm and nutrition programs. Overall, H.R. 2 is a positive step in that direction.  If H.R. 2 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA).  This bill begins to fulfill the President's commitment to rescue Americans from the failures of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and expand access to affordable, quality healthcare.  The AHCA offers patient-centered healthcare solutions that will promote innovation, reduce health insurance premiums, and empower doctors and patients to make healthcare choices.  The AHCA makes significant and important changes as part of a three step process to repeal and replace the ACA.  The AHCA would provide tax credits for Americans to promote affordability; improve Medicaid's sustainability and target resources to those most in need; and return healthcare choices to patients by expanding the use of health savings accounts.  The AHCA also would provide for a stable transition from the onerous requirements of the ACA, while providing peace of mind to Americans with pre-existing conditions. If H.R. 1628 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.* * * * * * *  ", "The Administration appreciates the House Armed Services Committee\u2019s (Committee) continued work on behalf of our national defense and supports a number of provisions in H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. The bill supports key Administration priorities, including ending the defense sequester, rebuilding our military readiness,  and modernizing our force for the future.  It authorizes funding for our ongoing efforts to destroy the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), to deter potential adversaries, and to bolster our allies.  The bill also includes important reforms to Department of Defense (DOD) management and business practices, and the Administration looks forward to working with the Committee to continue finding efficiencies at DOD.  The bill authorizes $18.5 billion above the President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget request for base national defense spending, as well as an additional $10 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding. The previous Administration enacted harmful cuts to defense spending, and this Administration strongly supports eliminating them.  To ensure that our military is not rebuilt on the backs of future generations of Americans, however, the Administration strongly supports reductions to spending elsewhere in the Federal budget, as outlined in the President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget request. While the bill contains many promising reforms, it fails to authorize a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, which would result in substantial recurring savings and allow DOD to align infrastructure with force structure.  The Administration is in the midst of conducting several strategic reviews  that affect multiple provisions in this bill, such as those addressing space organization and management and naval ship force structure.  Once these reviews are complete, the Administration will be prepared to suggest modifications to these provisions.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address its concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail below.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the classified annex and working with Congress to address any concerns about classified programs. Prohibition on Conducting Additional Base Realignment and Closure Round:  The Administration strongly objects to section 2702 and strongly urges Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can ensure it is not wasting scarce resources on unneeded infrastructure.  The Department estimates that a new BRAC round in 2021 would save it an 1  additional $2 billion annually\u2014resources it could apply to higher priorities such as readiness and modernization.  Establishment of Space Corps in the Department of the Air Force:  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s concerns with the organization and management of DOD\u2019s space capabilities as reflected in section 1601, which calls for the establishment of a separate Space Corps within the Department of the Air Force.  As the Secretary of Defense has testified, the Administration recognizes the criticality of our access to and use of space, and we understand the increasing threats posed  to our continued use of space capabilities.  As directed by the FY 2017 NDAA, the Administration is assessing a wide range of organizational options, including a Space Corps.  The creation of a separate Space Corps, however, is premature at this time.  Upon completion of these analyses, the Administration looks forward to working with Congress to implement military space organizational changes (while considering the budget implications) in a practical timeframe to best posture the Nation\u2019s joint forces to meet the challenges of the 21st Century.  Extension and Modification of Authority to Provide Assistance to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria:  The Administration appreciates the increased funding authority included in section 1222, but notes its concern that the provision does not contain additional requested authority for small-scale construction of temporary facilities that are necessary to meet operational needs and force protection requirements in both Iraq and Syria.  As the campaign to defeat ISIS transitions beyond the liberation of Mosul and Raqqa, operational commanders will need the requested authority to build temporary intermediate staging facilities, ammunition supply points, and tactical assembly areas that have adequate force protection.  These facilities, supply points, and assembly areas will enable the pursuit of ISIS into the Euphrates River Valley and help improve the security of Iraq\u2019s borders.  Current authorities, limited only to repair and renovation of existing Iraqi facilities, severely limit the coalition\u2019s maneuverability and its ability to respond quickly to changing operational conditions.   Extension and Modification of Authority to Support Operations and Activities of the Office of Security Cooperation in Iraq: The Administration appreciates the continuation of existing authority, but is disappointed by the lack of authority in section 1223 to expand the list of eligible recipients to include the \u201cmilitary and other security forces of or associated with the Government of Iraq with a national security mission.\u201d  The expanded authority would help address capability gaps, professionalization efforts, and defense institution building across the breadth of the Government of Iraq\u2019s (GoI\u2019s) national security institutions.  By aiding the development of the GoI\u2019s most critical missions\u2014counterterrorism, border security, and the protection of critical infrastructure\u2014the expanded authority proposed by the Administration would help Iraqis prevent the emergence of a successor to ISIS, safeguard their nation\u2019s hard-fought gains, and guide their recovery from  combat operations toward a more secure and stable nation.   Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Modernization and Sustainment of Assured Access to Space:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1615, which would restrict development of new space launch systems, including those whose development is significantly funded by industry, in exclusive favor of rocket engines and modifications to existing launch 2  vehicles.  The provision limits domestic competition, which will increase taxpayer costs by several billions of dollars through FY 2027 and stifle innovation.  It also ignores key recommendations of the Committee\u2019s independent panel of experts, who proposed broad funding at the launch-system level.  The Administration\u2019s innovative, agile approach has already saved taxpayers $300 million and is the quickest path to delivering modern, domestic, cost-effective launch capabilities that will support national security requirements for decades to come.  This provision would make the Administration\u2019s strategy impossible to execute, causing delays in transitioning from  Russian engines and increased risks to continued assured access to space.    Industrial Base for Large Solid Rocket Motors and Related Technologies:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1699, which would require the Secretary of Defense to pursue multiple sources for the  various components of modern solid rocket missile systems.  The large solid rocket motor industrial base has many single sources for components and materials.  In many cases, the quantities of systems, subsystems, or components or materials acquired by DOD are not sufficient to support multiple suppliers.  In addition, if a second source for these materials is required, it would trigger requalification on not only the rocket motor, but also the entire missile.  This would be cost prohibitive to DOD, totaling nearly $1 billion.  Notification Requirements for Sensitive Military Cyber Operations and Cyber Weapons:  The Administration objects to section 1651, which would require the Secretary of Defense to notify the congressional defense committees within 48 hours about the conduct of sensitive military cyber operations and the  results of any legal review by a military department of a cyber capability that is intended to be used as a weapon. DOD already regularly briefs the House and Senate Committees on Armed Services on major cyber operations. This provision would risk exposure, and potentially restrict use, of cyber capabilities; jeopardize foreign partnership cooperation; and impose additional, unwarranted administrative requirements on DOD.  Misuse of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Funds:  The Administration is concerned by the use of OCO funds for items not related to contingency operations, including an additional $558 million for Israel missile defense funding.  The bill also proposes using OCO to fund additional end strength, ships, and homeland defense.  Funding these enduring requirements in OCO would complicate the funding stability for associated outyear costs and runs contrary to the purpose of OCO.  Development of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Range Ground-Launched Missile System:  The Administration objects to sections 1244 and 1245, which would establish a program of record to develop a road-mobile, ground-launched cruise missile system  and would purport to abrogate Article VI of the INF treaty.  The Administration is currently developing an integrated diplomatic, military, and economic response strategy that maximizes pressure on Russia.  It is also evaluating those military capabilities that are needed to protect our national security. This provision unhelpfully ties the Administration to a specific missile system, which would limit potential military response options.  Section 1245(d) would also raise concerns among NATO allies and could deprive the Administration of the flexibility to make judgments about the timing and nature of invoking our legal remedies under the treaty.  The Administration would support broad authorization of research and development on missile systems, including 3  those prohibited by the treaty, to determine candidate systems  that could become programs of record.   Limitation on Availability of Funds Relating to Implementation of the Open Skies Treaty:  The Administration objects to section 1235(b), which would prohibit the expenditure of funds for procurement for the Digital Visual Imaging System  to modify the United States sensors and aircraft.  This section will prevent the United States from keeping pace with Russian Open Skies aircraft sensor upgrades, fully implementing the Open Skies Treaty, and increasing the value of the treaty to United States national security.  Cancellation of the project at this late date, after significant resources have already been expended, would further put the United States in breach of contract, thus incurring cancellation fees.  The provision would result in limited or no cost savings and possibly a cost increase, which would be an unacceptable waste of taxpayer dollars.   Foreign Commercial Satellite Services: Cybersecurity Threats and Launches:  The Administration strongly objects to section 1612, which would limit the Department\u2019s ability to procure satellite services from foreign entities.  It also would prohibit entering into a contract for satellite services with any entity if such services will be provided using satellites launched from,  or designed or manufactured in, a covered foreign country or by an entity controlled by the government of a covered foreign country, regardless of the location of the launch.  For satellite communications services, three-quarters of services acquired  today are from  foreign-incorporated companies that make widespread use of international launch vehicles.   Compensation Reform:  The Administration objects to section 601, which would place restrictions on the President\u2019s authority to set an alternative pay adjustment for members of the uniformed services.  The President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget request provides the funding necessary to ensure servicemembers continue to receive an appropriate package of pay and benefits.  The Administration, however, must balance this requirement against other investments critical to readiness, equipment, and modernization to ensure the military is the most capable warfighting force in the world.  The Administration strongly encourages members of Congress to support its basic pay raise, TRICARE modernization, and pharmacy co-pay proposals, which would save $600 million in FY 2018 and $7.1 billion through FY 2022.  Similarly, the Administration objects to section 604, which would prevent the Secretaries of the military departments from  implementing a reduced per diem for uniformed servicemembers and civilian employees who travel to one location for more than 30 days.  This provision is unnecessary because DOD has already implemented a policy allowing the services to pay travelers\u2019 actual expenses up to the full per diem rate when the reduced flat rate for meals and incidental expenses is insufficient for the assignment.  If adopted, this section would add $56 million or more annually to DOD\u2019s travel costs.  TRICARE Reform:  The Administration is disappointed that the Committee did not include the Administration\u2019s proposals to strengthen and improve the TRICARE benefit.  The current system creates confusion and increases administrative costs because it provides separate benefits for members and retirees based on their dates of initial entry into military service.  Vulnerable populations, including medically-retired members and their families, and survivors of those who died on active duty, also would be the first to pay increased costs under the new system.  In addition, the Administration is concerned that the Committee did not include reasonable 4  pharmacy co-pays.  The Administration believes strongly that the President\u2019s FY 2018 Military Health System benefit reform package represents a reasonable and financially sound proposal for our beneficiaries.  It protects vulnerable populations, eliminates a confusing and costly two-benefit program, and institutes reasonable pharmacy co-pays  that will ensure TRICARE remains a generous, yet sustainable, health benefits program.    Limitation on Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) Modification Authority for Members of the Uniformed Services Residing in Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) Housing:  The Administration objects to section 602, which would temporarily prohibit the Secretary of Defense from further reducing BAH below the current level for servicemembers residing in MHPI housing until 2019.  This would create two classes of uniformed members: those who reside in privatized housing and receive a higher housing allowance and those who reside within the local community and receive a lower housing allowance.  This is neither fair nor equitable since the opportunity to live in privatized housing on post is not always available.  Administering this section would require an additional set of rates for members in privatized housing, necessitating challenging and costly modifications to military pay systems.  Clarification of Roles of Commanders of Military  Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and Surgeons General: Section 711 would designate each MTF commander as the individual responsible for the operation of the MTF they supervise.  The Administration is concerned that this section would establish a potentially confusing organizational paradigm, as the Defense Health Agency (DHA) is also responsible for the management and administration of MTFs.  The Secretary of Defense should be allowed to determine the most effective management structure for the Military Health System.    Unobligated Balances Reductions:  The Administration objects to the $1.3 billion reduction for unobligated balances across multiple appropriations.  The reductions would only be applied to those programs funded in sections 4301, 4401, and 4501, which include military pay and allowances, military health care, readiness training, depot maintenance, base operations support, and facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization line items.  These reductions would delay the DOD\u2019s full-spectrum  readiness recovery efforts and increase the backlog of maintenance at the services\u2019 depot facilities.  Performance of Incurred Cost Audits:  The Administration objects to multiple provisions in section 802.  Mandating the acceptance of the claimed costs in their entirety if audit findings are not issued within one year of proposal receipt, restricting the  use of multi-year audits, mandating that an arbitrary 25 percent of incurred costs be audited by qualified private auditors in lieu of a data-driven process, and mandating materiality thresholds will result in significant inefficiencies in the DOD audit process and result in significant unallowable costs being paid to contractors.  Further, the materiality thresholds are significantly more prescriptive and detailed than defined in commercial or Government audit standards and are not risk-based.  Missile Defense Programs:  The Administration objects to section 1686, which would require the Secretary of Defense to ensure that anti-air warfare capabilities are deployed at the Aegis Ashore site in Romania by no later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act, and at the Aegis Ashore site in Poland no later than one year after the declaration of operational status at that site.  5  The accelerated timeline would require DOD to field an unproven defensive system without full knowledge of its combat effectiveness or the unintended consequences of operating a high-powered radar and weapon system  in a populated area surrounding Deveselu, Romania.  The diplomatic requirements to coordinate these issues with other nations are significant, even after proving the system  and understanding the consequences of the system on local populations.  In addition, the Administration strongly objects to section 1685, which would mandate a flight test of the SM-3 Block IIA missile against an ICBM class threat within 270 days of enactment.  Reinstatement of Requirement to Preserve Certain C-5 Aircraft:  The Administration strongly objects to section 143, which would require the Air Force to maintain at least 25 C-5A Avionics Modernization Program (AMP)-modified aircraft in flyable storage.  The Air Force currently has 52 C-5Ms within its total strategic aircraft inventory.  Requiring the maintenance of an additional 25 C-5As in flyable condition would  eliminate the relief provided in the FY 2017 NDAA from the FY 2013 NDAA requirement to keep retired C-5As in flyable storage.  The total estimated cost to regenerate 25 C-5A AMP aircraft into flyable condition would exceed $5.6 billion, not including aircrew and maintenance training costs, and would take an estimated nine years to complete.   Limitation on Expenditure of Funds for Emergency and Extraordinary Expenses for Intelligence  and Counterintelligence Activities and Representation Allowances:  While the Administration understands the Committee\u2019s concern with the use of these funds and will thoroughly examine this practice, the Administration objects to section 1031, which would prohibit using Emergency and Extraordinary Expenses authority for recurring expenses and lower the congressional notification threshold for intelligence and counterintelligence activities.  These changes would severely impede DOD\u2019s ability to conduct intelligence and counterintelligence operations and negatively affect ongoing counterterrorism  and other critical DOD operations.  Open Discovery Rule:  The Administration shares Congress\u2019 goal of preventing sexual assault in the military and holding accountable those who commit the offense.  Although the Administration is sympathetic to the motivation behind section 524, affording victim\u2019s counsel with open file discovery may have the unintended consequence of impairing the successful prosecution of cases by creating additional opportunities for the defense to challenge the victim\u2019s testimony.  In addition, the Administration encourages Congress to consider whether the information required by section 528 is already provided in annual Family Advocacy Program  reports.  Modernization of Army Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS): The Administration objects to section 1683, which would direct the Secretary of the Army to issue an acquisition strategy no later than April 15, 2018, for a 360-degree lower tier air and missile defense sensor that achieves initial operational capability by January 1, 2022, and completes fielding to all Army units by January 1, 2026.  The requirements and timelines in this provision are not feasible.  They would prevent the Army from developing LTAMDS integrally as part of its phased modernization approach for integrated air and missile defense based on Army and Joint Staff validated requirements.  Additionally, the Administration opposes the provision\u2019s direction to transfer the acquisition responsibility of the sensor to the Missile Defense Agency should the Army not issue the strategy in time. 6   Issues for Relocation of Marines to Guam:  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of section 1062, which would authorize the admission before October 1, 2020, of H-2B workers coming to Guam  to perform  certain military-related work or as health care workers under modified admission requirements.  The Administration strongly urges Congress to adopt the Administration\u2019s request, which would, among other things, extend the authority through December 31, 2023, and address specified needs in both Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (the CNMI).  The Department of the Navy\u2019s current workload projections indicate that approximately 2,300 H-2B workers would be required to supplement the Guam or CNMI workforce on military build-up construction projects.  Without additional H-2B workers, limited access to construction workers would harm our ability to relocate Marines to Guam on planned timelines.  This could be a factor in meeting the commitment of the United States to return land to Japan. In addition, the Administration objects to section 2822, which provides for the land conveyance of the Naval Ship Repair Facility, Guam.  The property is not excess to the needs of the Department of the Navy, as Military Sealift Command awarded a contract for ship repair that will require use of this property.  Opening this property to commercial use also would pose security concerns to nearby berthed Navy vessels, including the Department of the Navy losing control of whether the commercial entity can perform work on foreign vessels. Palau: The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s efforts in section 1265 to fund the 2010 United States-Palau Compact Review Agreement (CRA), but is disappointed that the Committee did not include the provision requested provision that would approve the 2010 CRA.  As a sovereign and freely associated state in the western Pacific, the Republic of Palau carries significant foreign policy and national security significance for the United States.  Congressional approval is required for the United States to enter into the CRA and modify the CRA\u2019s funding schedule as necessary for the United States to  meet its international commitments.  Failure to approve the CRA could imperil ongoing national security initiatives with the Republic of Palau and destabilize United States access and influence in a region that is increasingly contested by China.  Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility: The Administration strongly objects to section 3119 directing construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility.  The Administration appreciates the flexibility provided to the Secretary of Energy to waive that requirement and terminate the MOX project.  The MOX project is unaffordable and risky, with $12 billion in remaining construction costs, based on the most recent estimate prepared in collaboration with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy.  The project would bring total construction costs to $17 billion, when including $5 billion in sunk-costs to date.  In addition, the projected operating costs are between $800 million and $1 billion per year for nearly two decades.  The Administration supports the Committee\u2019s recommendation to authorize funds for the Savannah River Site\u2019s (SRS) dilute and dispose capability to remove from South Carolina, and dispose of, surplus plutonium stored at SRS.  Dilute and dispose is a proven approach with significantly less risk and expense, and it can be implemented decades sooner than the MOX approach.  7  Incremental Funding for National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2019s (NGA) New Campus West (N2W):  The Administration appreciates the support for NGA\u2019s N2W  facility, but objects to the proposed incremental funding approach.  The authorized level in the bill could lead to higher total project costs, delay the delivery of the campus, and negatively impact other mission-critical priorities.  Constitutional Concerns:  Certain provisions in this bill raise  constitutional concerns.  These include, for example, sections 1232 and 921(b).  Section 1232 would interfere with the President\u2019s exclusive authority to recognize foreign nations, and section 921(b) would contravene the Appointments Clause by authorizing incumbent officials to serve in new offices without further appointments.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other concerns as this legislation advances.   * * * * * * *   8  ", "The Administration supports H.R. 184, the  Protect Medical  Innovation Act of 2017, which would permanently repeal  Obamacare\u2019s  tax on medical devices.  Repealing this tax would lower  healthcare costs, save American jobs, and promote a patient-centered healthcare system.   The medical device tax, one of several  harmful  taxes enacted  in  Obamacare, has been delayed  several times due to bipartisan recognition that, if  imposed, it would raise healthcare costs for  millions of Americans and penalize companies that are investing in medical device research and  technology.  This tax is an obstacle for patients seeking  access to  medical advances, and threatens to undermine  the position  of the United States  as the global leader in healthcare investment and innovation.  This tax also reduces the number of high-skilled, highly  compensated American jobs.  Consistent with President Trump\u2019s promise to provide relief to Americans suffering  from the failures of Obamacare,  the Administration calls on the Congress to repeal permanently the unnecessary and  economically harmful medical device  tax.  If H.R. 184 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.  ** * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3354, making appropriations for the interior and environment, agriculture and rural development, commerce, justice, science, financial services and general government, homeland security, labor, health and human services, education, state and foreign operations, and transportation, housing and urban development for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes.The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s commitment to incorporate the text of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018, which is a strong step toward fulfilling the President\u2019s promise to put the safety of the American people first.  As noted in a supportive Statement of Administration Policy issued on July 24, 2017, H.R. 3219 provides critical funding to rebuild our military and includes the President\u2019s $1.6 billion border wall proposal. If H.R. 3354 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.The Administration strongly supports the House of Representatives\u2019 efforts to protect the right to life, cut down on needless and overly burdensome regulations, and strengthen border and immigration enforcement.  The Administration also appreciates the House of Representatives\u2019 work to rebuild our military and restrain overall non-defense discretionary spending, but notes that current spending levels as reflected in H.R. 3354 and H.R. 3219 would result in a sequestration of $72.4 billion in the defense category.  To help avoid a sequestration, the Administration urges both the House and Senate to enact the $57.3 billion in savings included in the Major Savings and Reforms volume of the FY 2018 Budget request while also making the necessary changes to the discretionary caps. The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.Division A \u2013 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018Department of the Interior (DOI)Federal Land Acquisition.  The Administration objects to the increase in funding provided by the bill for land acquisition, which is $50 million above the FY 2018 Budget request.  The Department currently manages roughly 500 million acres and has a deferred infrastructure maintenance backlog of approximately $15 billion.  Limited resources should be focused on ongoing operations and maintenance. DOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service  Wildland Fire Funding.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s investment in wildland fire operations at $3.4 billion as requested in the FY 2018 Budget, including fully funding suppression at the 10-year average for both the Forest Service and DOI.  The Administration also appreciates the Committee\u2019s acceptance of the FY 2018 Budget proposal to move funding for the first eight hours of work per day out of fire suppression and into preparedness.  The \u201cbase 8\u201d shift moves the Forest Service to a more accurate and accountable budget approach that is consistent with DOI, with salaries for all firefighters planned for in full.  USDA  Forest Service Land Acquisition.  The Administration objects to the increase in funding provided in the bill to increase land acquisition by $18 million over the FY 2018 Budget request.  The Forest Service currently manages 193 million acres, has a deferred infrastructure maintenance backlog of over $5 billion, and would be better served if its scarce resources were focused on improved management of existing assets and lands.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  State Revolving Funds (SRFs).  While the Administration appreciates the attention paid to critical water infrastructure needs through the funding provided to the Water Infrastructure and Finance Innovation Act credit program, the Administration is disappointed in the reduction to the Clean Water SRF.  Infrastructure investment is a priority for the Administration and the bill level of $1.1 billion for the SRF, which is $250 million lower than the FY 2018 Budget request, would result in less funding going to States to finance critical wastewater and storm water infrastructure investments.   Other Independent Agencies   Smithsonian Institution (Institution).  The Administration urges the Congress to fund the Smithsonian Facilities Capital account at the $228 million requested in the FY 2018 Budget.  The National Air and Space Museum (NASM) is in critical need of repair, and funding the NASM project within the level provided by the bill would force the Institution to divert funding from its Facilities Capital budget, leaving the Institution with insufficient funding for the many other important safety, security, and critical infrastructure projects planned for FY 2018.   Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 403, 409, and other provisions raise separation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of funds upon approval by committees of the Congress.     2   Division B \u2013 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018  Rural Economic Infrastructure Grant Program.  The Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s support for rural America through the establishment of the Rural Economic Infrastructure Grant Program, for which the bill provides $123 million, with a $60 million set-aside for projects in Appalachia.  Rural Broadband Loan Program.  The Administration welcomes the bill\u2019s support of high-speed internet in rural America through the $27 million in loans made available under the Rural Broadband Loan Program.   Food Safety.  The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the FY 2018 Budget request for the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which would help ensure that all meat, poultry, and egg products are safe, wholesome, and properly labeled.  Credit for Farmers.  The Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s support for farmers through the bill\u2019s $7 billion for Farm Service Agency direct and guaranteed farm ownership and operating loans.  Rural Development Programs.  The Administration is concerned that the bill misses an opportunity to reduce duplicative spending by funding Rural Business-Cooperative Service programs, the direct loan and grant program for water and wastewater, as well as single family housing direct loans.  The Small Business Administration\u2019s loan program, EPA\u2019s State Revolving Funds, Federal housing loan guarantees, and the private sector can effectively meet the demands for these programs.   McGovern-Dole International Food for Education Program (McGovern-Dole).  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides $202 million in funding for McGovern-Dole, which the FY 2018 Budget proposes for elimination.  McGovern-Dole is duplicative of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs, is being ineffectively implemented, and has unaddressed oversight and performance monitoring challenges.  P.L. 480 Title II Food Aid (Title II).  The Administration opposes providing food aid funding through use of Title II and prefers that all food aid be provided through the International Disaster Assistance account in USAID.  While the United States is the world\u2019s largest donor of food aid, taxpayers expect such aid to be provided in the most cost-effective manner possible.  Unfortunately, Title II is cost-inefficient, slow, and limits the ability of USAID to use the most appropriate food aid intervention for a particular crisis.  Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, section 716 would violate the Recommendation Clause; sections 702, 706, 717, 727, and other provisions raise separation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of funds upon approval by committees of the Congress; and section 719 would interfere with the President\u2019s Take Care 3   authority to supervise the Executive Branch. Division C \u2013 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 Department of Commerce Census Bureau.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s strong support of the 2020 Decennial Census and other periodic programs.  The Administration continues to assess the progress of planning and preparing for a modern and improved 2020 Census and looks forward to working closely with the Congress in order to deliver an accurate and on-time decennial census while efficiently using taxpayer resources.  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Polar Follow On (PFO) Program.  The Administration is concerned that the bill only provides $50 million of the $180 million requested for NOAA\u2019s PFO weather satellite.  Insufficient funding for this program could increase both the cost of procurement in future years and the risk that critical weather forecasting data would be unavailable after the current generation of satellites reach the end of their operational lives.  NOAA Fisheries Disaster Assistance.  The Administration opposes the bill\u2019s $20 million in unrequested funds for commercial fisheries that received disaster declarations in FY 2017.  Businesses affected by these fishery disasters have access to assistance through other Government programs, such as the Small Business Administration\u2019s disaster loan program. Department of Justice (DOJ) Immigration Judge Teams (IJ Teams).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided in the bill for the Executive Office for Immigration Review to hire an additional 65 IJ Teams that would support efforts to efficiently and effectively adjudicate cases, including reducing the current case backlog.  State and Local Grants.  The Administration appreciates the overall support provided by the bill to DOJ\u2019s State and local law enforcement assistance grants.  The Administration urges the Congress, however, to restore stand-alone funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services Hiring Program, currently provided for under the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program, and eliminate funding for the unrequested and unauthorized State Criminal Alien Assistance Program.  State and Local Information Sharing.  The Administration has previously stated its support for H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and urges the Congress to also include section 219 of the FY 2018 Budget request in the appropriations bill.  The amendments proposed by section 219 would prevent State and local government officials from prohibiting or restricting any law enforcement entity or official from complying with a lawful civil immigration detainer request, and would authorize the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and DOJ to make Federal grant awards subject to State and local cooperation with immigration enforcement activities and requests. 4  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Overall NASA Funding.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for NASA.  Extending the Nation\u2019s leadership in space is important and the NASA programs funded by this bill would help the Nation meet future challenges.  Science.  The Administration appreciates the Committee's support for NASA Science, but is concerned that funding additional flagship missions in FY 2018 would place significant pressure on the Science budget in future years as these missions ramp up and compete with other priorities.  The FY 2018 Budget request for NASA Science reflects a balanced portfolio that is consistent with direction from the Decadal Survey for each discipline.National Space Council (NSpC) NSpC Funding. The Administration has revived the National Space Council, which is tasked with advising and assisting the President regarding national space policy and strategy.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to provide funding for the Space Council as a separate office within the Executive Office of the President.  National Science Foundation (NSF) NSF Funding.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides $7.3 billion for NSF, which is $687 million above the FY 2018 Budget request.  The request focuses funding on NSF\u2019s core research programs and undoes some of the large increases to programs that occurred during the previous administration. Constitutional Concerns Certain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 518 and 529 would intrude upon the President\u2019s constitutional authority to negotiate international agreements and conduct international diplomacy. Division D \u2013 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2018 Department of the Treasury Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) Funding.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for TFI.  The Department of the Treasury programs that freeze the accounts of terrorists and proliferators, implement sanctions on rogue nations, and link law enforcement agencies with financial institutions are critical to the continued safety and financial stability of the Nation.  Further, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure support for the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC), a key outcome from the President\u2019s summit in Saudi Arabia.  The TFTC would enhance cooperation with Gulf countries in the fight against terrorism, and counter Iran\u2019s malign influence.  5  General Services Administration (GSA) Overall GSA Funding.  The FY 2018 Budget request for GSA includes a number of new funding mechanisms to facilitate Government streamlining and modernization.  The Administration urges the Congress to support these initiatives, which either have been recently authorized by the Congress or are being actively pursued legislatively. Technology Modernization Fund (TMF).  The bill does not include $228 million requested for the TMF to retire and replace antiquated legacy information technology (IT) systems.  The TMF is an important step in changing the way the Federal Government manages its IT portfolio by establishing a central mechanism designed to improve management and oversight with resources dedicated to IT modernization, moving agencies to more secure and efficient IT systems, and infrastructure.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to provide the necessary funding for the TMF as the authorizing legislation moves forward. Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC).  The bill does not include $9 million for FPISC to execute its statutory mission outlined under Title 41 of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act.  Ensuring that the Federal environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure projects is coordinated, predictable, and transparent is a top priority of the Administration. Asset Management and Space Proceeds Fund (AMSPF).  The Administration appreciates that the Committee has provided resources to stand up the Public Buildings Reform Board authorized under the Federal Asset Sales and Transfer Act.  The Administration, however, urges the Congress to fund the AMSPF at the requested level of $40 million, which would help carry out the recommendations of the Board to dispose of unneeded Federal property and improve efficiency.  Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) Capital Program.  The Administration objects to the diversion of more than $2 billion in FBF rent proceeds from investment in the capital program.  The bill eliminates all funding for the construction and major renovation programs, and significantly underfunds both the minor repair and maintenance and special emphasis programs. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) OPM IT Modernization.  The Administration welcomes the $18 million in funding provided in the bill to fund important IT modernization improvements at OPM.  At the same time, the Administration urges the Congress to fully fund the $37 million included in the FY 2018 Budget request for this purpose.  It is vital that OPM has the resources necessary to fund modernization of its IT systems, including its financial and retirement servicing systems.  These resources are necessary to defend against increasingly advanced cyber threats.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure OPM is capable of meeting these needs.  6  Other  Financial Regulatory Reform.  The Administration commends the Committee for moving financial reform legislation through the Congress.  The Administration is committed to reforming the Nation\u2019s financial system, as demonstrated by Executive Order 13772, Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System, and the Department of the Treasury\u2019s ensuing review.  The bill reflects the Administration\u2019s Core Principles in several key respects.  In particular, the bill would provide regulatory relief to community financial institutions and rein in the unchecked authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  However, the Administration is concerned with section 632 of the bill, which would impede the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s ability to investigate and uncover securities fraud by inhibiting its access to the content of electronic communications from internet service providers.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact legislation that supports the Core Principles.  Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 101, 118, 119, 122, 123, 201, 302, 511, 520, 608, 609, 717, 729, 738, 803, 815, and other provisions raise separation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of funds upon approval by committees of the Congress; and provisions in title II under the heading \u201cOffice of Management and Budget\u2014Salaries and Expenses\u201d would interfere with the President\u2019s constitutional authority to supervise and direct the Executive Branch.  Division E \u2013 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018  Border Wall.  The Administration greatly appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the fully funded border wall proposal, which is a critical element of the Administration\u2019s strategy to secure the borders.  Physical barriers are vital for border security because they deter, prevent, and deny potential illegal border crossings for illegal alien movement generally, and for human smuggling and drug smuggling specifically.  The $1.6 billion provided by H.R. 3219, which is expected to be incorporated into the bill, is for physical barrier construction along the southwest border in the areas with the highest current risk and the greatest current operational need, including $784 million for 32 miles of new border fencing in Rio Grande Valley (RGV), Texas, $498 million for 28 miles of new levee wall in RGV, and $251 million for 14 miles of secondary fencing in San Diego, California.  Strengthening Immigration Enforcement.  The Administration greatly appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the FY 2018 Budget request to strengthen immigration enforcement, including by hiring immigration law enforcement officers and agents and by increasing immigration detention capacity.  Additional resources for these efforts would help to ensure increased border security, the apprehension, detention, and removal of dangerous aliens from the Nation\u2019s streets, and the disruption and dismantling of human smuggling and trafficking activities conducted by transnational criminal organizations.    7   State and Local Information Sharing.  The Administration has previously stated its support for H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, and urges the Congress to also include section 523 of the FY 2018 Budget request in the appropriations bill.  The amendments proposed by section 523 would prevent State and local government officials from prohibiting or restricting any law enforcement entity or official from complying with a lawful civil immigration detainer request, and would authorize DHS and DOJ to make Federal grant awards subject to State and local cooperation with immigration enforcement activities and requests.  The Administration is committed to strengthening enforcement of the Nation\u2019s immigration laws in order to improve national security and public safety.  This proposal is critical to these efforts.  Statute of Limitations for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance Recoveries.  The Administration objects to section 540 of the bill, which changes the three-year statute of limitations for recovery of FEMA disaster assistance grants provided to State or local governments.  Section 540 of the bill would amend the recovery action timeline to begin when an individual project is completed, instead of when a recipient (or sub-recipient) has completed all work for a disaster or emergency.  The Administration understands that State and local recovery efforts are important; but it is also important for FEMA to have adequate time to properly review recovery expenditures and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent appropriately.  U.S. Secret Service Staffing.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for Secret Service hiring.  The bill fully supports the FY 2018 Budget request to increase Secret Service staffing by over 300 agents, officers, and professional staff, which would enable the agency to address chronic staffing shortfalls and reach a sustainable staffing level.  Constitutional Concerns  Section 509 of the bill raises separation of powers concerns because it purports to condition the use of appropriated funds upon approval by committees of the Congress.  Division F \u2013 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018  Department of Labor  Apprenticeship.  The Administration strongly opposes the elimination of funding for apprenticeship grants.  Apprenticeships equip workers with the skills needed to compete and allow workers to earn while they learn.  Terminating the apprenticeships initiative would hinder efforts to allow more workers and employers to benefit from this proven model that closes the skills gap.   Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS).  The bill does not provide OLMS with the resources necessary to protect union members from corruption.  The previous administration allowed employment in OLMS to fall by one-third, severely impeding the Agency\u2019s ability to investigate and prosecute financial misconduct in labor organizations.  The Administration believes the $47 million requested in the FY 2018 Budget would provide better protection for America\u2019s workers. 8   Department of Health and Human Services  Indirect Cost Restriction.  The Administration is disappointed by language included in section 228 of the bill, which prohibits changes to the method the National Institutes of Health (NIH) uses to pay grantee institutions for administrative and facilities costs.  Further, the Administration is strongly opposed to any attempts to prohibit NIH or any other Agency staff from developing strategies to make Government programs more effective and efficient.    Department of Education  Title I and Public School Choice Grants.  The Administration opposes the omission of increased funding for Title I, which would provide supplemental awards to school districts that decide to provide more educational options to students.  This would allow students to benefit from Federal, State, and local funds to attend the public school of their choice.  The FY 2018 Budget request includes $1 billion to support a public school choice proposal for all students and give disadvantaged students from low-income areas the opportunity to attend a quality K-12 school.   Education, Innovation and Research (EIR) and School Choice.  The Administration opposes the lack of funding for the EIR program, including the $250 million requested to expand and evaluate the effectiveness and opportunities provided through private school choice programs across the Nation.  EIR supports the expansion of innovative and proven approaches to improve America\u2019s education system, address persistent challenges in education, and build institutional knowledge of what is working.  Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants.  The Administration supports the elimination of Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants, as proposed in the FY 2018 Budget request and as reflected in the bill.  These grants are poorly targeted and funds are spread too thinly to have a meaningful impact on student outcomes. There are better ways to use funding to effectively assist students and to support those who need it most.  Social Security Administration (SSA)  SSA Limitation on Administrative Expenses.  The Administration supports the funding level provided for SSA\u2019s administrative budget.  The bill funds dedicated program integrity activities at $1.7 billion, including funding the fully authorized cap adjustment level of $1.5 billion.  Program integrity activities are crucial to ensuring only eligible individuals receive social security benefits.  Other Independent Agencies  Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS).  The Administration opposes funding of the IMLS.  The bill provides $231 million for IMLS, whereas the FY 2018 Budget requested $23 million to close down IMLS.  IMLS\u2019s funding supplements State, local, and private funds, which provide the vast majority of funding to museums and libraries.  In addition, authorization of appropriations for this Agency expired in FY 2016.   9   Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).  The Administration objects to the FY 2020 funding level provided for CPB through the two-year advance appropriation.  The FY 2018 Budget request proposes eliminating Federal funding for CPB by FY 2019 and proposes rescinding all but $30 million of the FY 2018 appropriation.  CPB grants represent a small share of the total funding for the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio and the Administration believes private donations would be sufficient to fund these operations.   Division G \u2013 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2018  Department of State and Other International Programs  Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The Administration commends the Committee for supporting the proposal in the FY 2018 Budget to begin reining in the excessive expansion of OCO for the Department of State and USAID (State/USAID), and would oppose an OCO funding level higher than $12 billion.  OCO funding for State/USAID began as a tool to provide for the temporary and extraordinary costs related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but has been distorted to serve as a back-door means of circumventing the cap on non-defense discretionary spending.   Department of the Treasury Contributions to Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs).  The Administration strongly opposes the over $600 million reduction to the FY 2018 Budget request for the Department\u2019s contributions to the MDBs.  The decreases in the bill to the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association and the African Development Fund are particularly problematic, as the requested funding level would support development in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries by leveraging funding from other donors.  This major reduction would upset the delicate balance needed to maintain United States leadership at these institutions while ensuring that other donors pay their fair share.   Eliminations and Reductions.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee adopted some of the reductions proposed in the FY 2018 Budget, including eliminating funding for the East-West Center, the International Organizations and Programs, and the Complex Crises Fund accounts, and for contributions to the Green Climate Fund and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program.  Furthermore, funding could be restored for Treasury International Programs by supporting the other eliminations and reductions requested in the FY 2018 Budget.  The programs proposed for termination are not critical to the conduct of United States foreign policy and often duplicate the efforts of other Federal programs or the non-profit and private sectors.   Foreign Military Financing (FMF).  The Administration appreciates that the Committee supports FMF programs including assistance to Israel, but is concerned that the bill does not provide the requested authority to provide FMF loans.  FMF loans offer the opportunity to further support the United States industrial base while promoting burden sharing via direct loans rather than grants to foreign partners.  Export-Import Bank (Bank) Board Quorum Waiver.  The Administration opposes the inclusion of language that would effectively waive the requirement that the Export-Import Bank have at 10   least three board members to constitute a quorum.  The Administration urges the Congress to act on the Administration\u2019s pending nominees to the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors and restore the Bank\u2019s full operating authority, rather than circumvent the confirmation process.   Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, a proviso in title I under the heading \u201cDepartment of State\u2014International Organizations\u2014Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities\u201d would infringe upon the President\u2019s authority as Commander-in-Chief and over the conduct of diplomacy; although the Administration shares the policy views in section 7070, that provision would interfere with the President\u2019s authority to recognize foreign governments and conduct diplomacy; and numerous provisions, including provisions in sections 7013, 7025, 7029, 7031, 7037, 7041, 7042, 7043, and 7071 would infringe upon the President\u2019s authority to conduct diplomacy and receive foreign diplomats.  Division H \u2013 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018  Department of Transportation (DOT)  Infrastructure Investment.  The FY 2018 Budget supports a new vision for infrastructure investment in the Nation with a focused role for the Federal Government\u2014streamlining burdensome approval processes and incentivizing more investment by rewarding States and localities that support infrastructure projects and maintain them over the long term.  The bill, however, includes unrequested funding for Capital Investment Grants, Essential Air Service, and Amtrak contrary to reforms proposed in the FY 2018 Budget.  These reforms would respectively, limit funding for local transit projects that should be funded by States and localities that benefit from their use, eliminate discretionary funding and focus on remote airports that are most in need of subsidized commercial air service, and terminate Federal support for long-distance train services that serve a small percentage of the population and generate significant operating losses.  TIGER Grants.  The Administration appreciates that the bill supports the FY 2018 Budget request to eliminate funding for TIGER Grants, given that Federal funding should not be directed to projects with localized benefits that often do not rise to the level of national or regional significance.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  Rental Assistance.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support of HUD rental assistance to low-income families.  However, the bill funds rental assistance programs at $38.5 billion, which is $3.3 billion above the FY 2018 Budget request, ignoring reforms to put rental assistance on a more sustainable fiscal path while also continuing to assist current residents, encouraging work, and promoting self-sufficiency.   HUD IT.  The Administration is concerned that HUD would be unable to maintain IT current services or invest in needed IT improvements, as the bill provides $150 million for IT\u201411   $100 million below the FY 2018 Budget request.  Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions in the bill raise constitutional concerns.  For instance, sections 221, 230, 287, 406 would raise separation of powers concerns because they purport to condition the use of funds upon approval by committees of the Congress.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2018 appropriations process moves forward.  * * * * * * *  12   ", "The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations.  The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on States, local communities, and institutions of higher education.  H.J. Res. 42 would nullify the Employment and Training Administration's Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Labor.  The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested.  The rule  imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.    H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. Reg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize regional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for activities on public lands.  The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located mostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy and mineral development.  Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes the rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities\u2019 interests and could potentially dilute their input in planning decisions.  H.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act \u2013 Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86076 (Nov. 29, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education.  This rule establishes requirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have an accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student success, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student progress.  While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local control of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas where the ESSA intended broad flexibility.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they implement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  H.J. Res. 58 would nullify the final rule related to the Teacher Preparation Program Accountability System, 81 Fed. Reg. 75494 (Oct. 31, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education.  This rule establishes annual State reporting to measure the performance and quality of teacher preparation programs and tie them to program eligibility for participation in the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program.  The rule imposes new burdensome and costly data reporting requirements on States and institutions of higher education.    If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law.    ", "The Administration appreciates the work of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee to reauthorize the farm bill in a timely manner to provide support to our Nation\u2019s farm and rural communities.   In particular, the Administration welcomes the Committee\u2019s adoption of some of the reforms proposed in the President\u2019s Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The bill moves in the right direction to tighten existing income limits for eligibility for some farm subsidies from $900,000 to $700,000, but the Administration urges the Senate to go further in reducing the income limit.  The bill would also adopt market-based interest rates for electric and telecommunication loan borrowers, thus removing unnecessary subsidies.  The Administration encourages the Senate to include more farm safety net reforms from the FY 2019 Budget for USDA that would better target payments to farmers who need them most. The bill misses key opportunities to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).  Most notably, the bill does not strengthen work requirements for able-bodied working age adults.  The bill also fails to close eligibility loopholes and target benefits to the neediest households as proposed in the President\u2019s Budgets for FY 2018 and FY 2019.  It also fails to better align SNAP Employment and Training with other Federal workforce programs.  The bill lacks meaningful regulatory reform, and the Administration opposes dozens of additional burdensome requirements for new reports, studies, and pilots.  The Administration is concerned that the bill does not incorporate any of the conservation program changes proposed in the FY 2019 Budget that prioritized funding for programs that have shown positive outcomes while eliminating funding for those programs with limited outcomes.  Unfortunately, the bill would also reverse streamlining improvements that were made in the conservation title of the 2014 farm bill and instead expand conservation programs through increased Conservation Reserve Program acreage caps and the introduction of multiple new programs.   The Administration would support a reform of P.L. 480 Title II food aid that maximizes resources in responding to global food crises while promoting food security.  The current bill does not include meaningful reforms. The Administration looks forward to working with the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee to address these and other issues with the farm bill as the process moves forward.  * * * * * * * ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of S. 2372, the VA MISSION Act of 2018. This legislation would fundamentally transform elements of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, fulfill the President\u2019s commitment to provide veterans with more choice in their healthcare providers and prevent a funding shortfall in the current Veterans Choice Program (Choice Program).  The bill is the product of months of work between the legislative and executive branches, and reflects an agreement reached between the Administration and key leaders in the House and Senate. The VA MISSION Act would consolidate VA\u2019s community care programs into a new Veterans Community Care Program.  This new program would strengthen the VA by merging the Department\u2019s tangled web of competing and confusing community care programs, including the Choice Program, into one system that is easier to navigate for veterans, VA employees, and community partners.  It will help to ensure that veterans choose the VA by getting them the right care at the right time with the right provider.  Additionally, unifying funding for the new VA community care program by using discretionary resources will increase transparency and accountability. The Administration estimates that funding for the current Choice Program could be exhausted as early as May 31, 2018.  This bill provides $5.2 billion in mandatory funding for the Choice Program, which the Administration expects to be sufficient for the program to continue to provide care to veterans until the new, consolidated Veterans Community Care Program is operational\u2014approximately one year after enactment of this bill.  If this bill were enacted, the Choice Program should not require any additional mandatory funding. S. 2372 would expand eligibility for the VA\u2019s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, which promotes and enhances veteran wellbeing through the provision of unprecedented services and support to caregivers of veterans who require the care and assistance of another.  Post-9/11 veterans have benefitted greatly from this program.  The bill would end a disparity in veterans\u2019 benefits by expanding the program to include eligible veterans from all eras of service.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that adequate funding is provided for this expansion. The VA\u2019s ability to effectively and efficiently manage its real property portfolio is a critical component of operating a high-performing and integrated healthcare system.  The asset and    infrastructure review process in S. 2372 would provide the VA with the necessary flexibility to align its infrastructure footprint with the needs of our Nation\u2019s veterans.  The VA will also benefit greatly from the provisions that strengthen its ability to recruit and retain quality healthcare professionals.   President Trump has been\u2014and will continue to be\u2014a champion for America\u2019s veterans.  The Administration is proud of the steps that it already has taken to improve accountability and transparency at the VA.  Enacting the VA MISSION Act will strengthen the VA\u2019s ability to deliver timely, high-quality healthcare in its own facilities, while ensuring seamless integration with community care providers.  This will result in a 21st century system that offers our veterans the highest level of care in both VA facilities and the community.  The Administration urges the House and Senate to pass this critical legislation by Memorial Day to ensure that veterans can continue to receive care through the Choice Program without disruption. If the VA MISSION Act of 2018 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign it into law.  * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.J. Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67.  These joint resolutions of disapproval would nullify two rules promulgated by the Employee Benefits Security Administration of the Department of Labor:  (1) Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non-Governmental Employees, 81 Fed. Reg. 59464 (Aug. 30, 2016); and (2) Savings Arrangements Established by Qualified State Political Subdivisions for Non-Governmental Employees, 81 Fed. Reg. 92639 (Dec. 20, 2016), respectively.  The rules allow a new type of State-based retirement plan that would lack important Federal protections, and they would give a competitive advantage to these public plans.  These joint resolutions would prevent the Department of Labor from reissuing a rule that is substantially the same as the disapproved rule absent specific future congressional authorization. If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration appreciates investments that H.R. 6147, making appropriations for interior, environment, financial services and general government for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, makes in the Nation\u2019s natural resources, financial infrastructure, and Government operations. The Administration welcomes the House\u2019s timely consideration of appropriations legislation, and looks forward to working with the Congress well before the end of the fiscal year to enact individual bills that provide sufficient funding to essential programs without further jeopardizing the Nation\u2019s fiscal state. Division A of H.R. 6147 provides funding for programs requested in the FY 2019 Budget, such as energy development, National Park Service construction, and wildland fire response.  The Administration appreciates the support for these and other priorities, such as critical water infrastructure needs funded through both the State Revolving Funds and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act credit program.  However, division A funds numerous programs at levels well above the FY 2019 Budget request, and does not include major recommended reductions.  Division A is $7 billion\u2014approximately 25 percent\u2014above the FY 2019 request, and the EPA alone is funded at almost $2 billion above the Administration\u2019s requested level. The Administration greatly appreciates the efforts made in division B to reduce Federal spending below the non-Defense discretionary cap level set by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA).  The Fund for America\u2019s Kids and Grandkids, which reserves funds until the Federal budget deficit is erased, is a novel and commendable effort towards fiscal responsibility.  Given the Nation\u2019s long-term fiscal constraints and the need to right-size the Federal Government, the Administration encourages the Congress to continue identifying ways to reduce spending below the BBA non-Defense discretionary cap.  Division B also supports the Administration\u2019s priorities including countering terrorist financing, implementing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, protecting life and religious liberty in Washington, D.C., and fundamentally reforming the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the House Appropriations Committee\u2019s (Committee) version of the bill.  Division A \u2013 Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019  Department of the Interior (DOI)  DOI Topline.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for priority DOI programs, however, it also provides increased funding in excess of the FY 2019 Budget request for a number of DOI programs.  In total, the bill provides an estimated $13.1 billion for DOI, $2.4 billion more than the FY 2019 Budget request.  Energy Development.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s commitment to energy development on public lands and in offshore waters, including additional resources above the FY 2019 Budget request in the Bureaus of Land Management, Ocean Energy Management, and Safety and Environmental Enforcement.  National Park Service (NPS) Construction.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for NPS construction, and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to address the NPS deferred maintenance backlog.  DOI and Department of Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service  Wildland Fire Management.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s $3.9 billion investment in wildland fire operations, fully funding the 10-year average for wildland fire suppression costs for both the Forest Service and DOI.  The Administration also appreciates the additional funds provided in the bill to cover suppression costs above the 10-year average, which would help in the year before wildfire cap adjustment funds become available.  Federal Land Acquisition.  The Administration opposes funding provided in the bill for land acquisition, which is $124 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Departments currently manage roughly 700 million acres and have a deferred maintenance infrastructure backlog of over $16 billion.  Acquiring new lands, however, is a low priority.  USDA, Forest Service  USDA, Forest Service Topline.  The Administration is concerned that funding for non-fire programs is $960 million above the FY 2019 Budget request, with large increases for facilities and roads, and for State and Private Forestry grants.  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  EPA Topline.  The Administration is concerned that the bill would provide $8.3 billion for EPA, which is $2.2 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request, and includes funding for programs that are outside of the Agency\u2019s core responsibilities.  Funding for Water Infrastructure.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s attention to critical water infrastructure needs through the robust funding provided to both the State 2   Revolving Funds and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act credit program.  Combined, this funding could support several billion dollars in total water infrastructure investment for a wide variety of needs.    Superfund.  The Administration appreciates the $1.2 billion included in the bill for the Hazardous Substance Superfund account, which would support infrastructure projects and ongoing cleanup of contaminated sites that are impacting the health and economic well-being of communities.  EPA Geographic Programs.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides $398 million above the FY 2019 Budget request for the Geographic Programs, which perform local ecosystem protection activities, much of which is more appropriately funded by State and local entities.  Categorical Grants.  The Administration continues to recommend reductions to Categorical Grants, which the bill would fund at $469 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  Reductions to these grants would reduce Federal funding for State activities that go beyond statutory mandates, and would encourage a rebalancing of environmental program funding between Federal and State resources.  EPA\u2019s Science and Technology Account.  The Administration continues to advocate for reductions in the Science and Technology account, which is funded at $644 million or $220 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  This account includes programs in research and development that are not necessary to implement core EPA responsibilities.  Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) Grant Program.  The bill provides $100 million, or $90 million above the FY 2019 Budget request for the DERA grant program.  While the Administration supports limited DERA funding for targeted high-priority projects, DERA projects overlap with other Federal and State programs, and have diminishing returns for older vehicles that would eventually be replaced regardless of DERA grant funding levels.  States may also be able to use some of a $2.7 billion fund established through a settlement with Volkswagen to support very similar projects to those normally funded by the DERA program.  Other Independent Agencies  National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars (Wilson Center).  The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not eliminate Federal funding for NEA, NEH, and Wilson Center.  The Administration recognizes the positive effects the arts and humanities have on our communities; however the FY 2019 Budget request proposed an orderly phase-out of Federal funding for these agencies, as the Administration does not consider their activities to be core Federal responsibilities.  Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns by contravening the separation of powers between the Executive Branch and the Congress.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns. 3    Division B \u2013 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2019  Department of the Treasury  The Fund for America\u2019s Kids and Grandkids (Fund).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of the Fund in the bill.  The Fund is an example of how the Congress can safeguard funds for future generations and spend below the discretionary caps in a time of excessive deficits.  Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The bill provides the IRS a total of $11.6 billion, $482 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  This amount includes $77 million in dedicated funding for tax reform implementation and base funding for tax enforcement that is $232 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for tax reform and the amounts provided in the bill fully fund the Administration\u2019s two-year proposal requested in FY 2018.  While the Administration supports additional investment in tax enforcement and the resulting deficit savings, the program integrity cap adjustment proposed in the FY 2019 Budget would be a more appropriate way to fund these activities.  Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).  The bill provides TFI a total of $161 million, $2 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for TFI to continue its critical work safeguarding the financial system from abuse and combatting other national security threats using non-kinetic economic tools.  Treasury Departmental Offices.  The bill provides $209 million for Treasury\u2019s Departmental Offices, $7 million above the FY 2019 Budget request.  These additional funds could be used to strengthen review of foreign investment in the United States and address other emerging priorities.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to provide adequate resources to support anticipated increases in the caseload for review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.  Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The bill provides $216 million, $202 million above the FY 2019 Budget request, for the CDFI Fund.  The requested amount is sufficient to support ongoing CDFI Fund activities, including the New Markets Tax Credit and the zero-subsidy Bond Guarantee Program.  Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP).  The Administration encourages the Congress to include language in the final FY 2019 bill that would allow BEP to purchase land and construct a new currency production facility in the National Capital Region.  This authority would save the Federal Government approximately $600 million and would lower the operating costs associated with printing of our Nation\u2019s currency.  Executive Office of the President (EOP)  Information Technology Oversight and Reform (ITOR).  While the Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the EOP, including a funding increase for the Office of 4   Management and Budget (OMB), the bill does not adequately fund the ITOR account.  To maintain the ability of the OMB Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO) to perform statutorily required IT oversight, policy development, and IT security functions and the U.S. Digital Service\u2019s ability to respond effectively to significant security breaches or recover failed systems, the Administration urges the Congress to fund ITOR at the level requested in the FY 2019 Budget and to support the requested funding necessary to transition certain OFCIO activities to the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) Office of Government-wide Policy.   General Services Administration (GSA)  Federal Information Technology (IT) Modernization.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s attention to modernizing vulnerable and inefficient legacy IT systems and welcomes the $150 million in continued support for the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) as a means of addressing these pressing challenges.  The Administration believes that any additional funding would be well-utilized and will continue working with the Committee to demonstrate the taxpayer value generated by the TMF.  Federal Buildings Fund (FBF) Capital Program.  The Administration is concerned that the bill diverts more than $1.5 billion in FBF rent receipts from investment in the capital program.  The bill eliminates essential funding for priority construction, acquisition, and repair and alteration projects such as the purchase of the Department of Transportation headquarters.  Federal Capital Revolving Fund.  The Administration continues to support the establishment of a Federal Capital Revolving Fund (FCRF), a new budgetary mechanism for large civilian real property projects.  The Administration recently transmitted legislative language and looks forward to working with the Congress to enact the FCRF proposal.  Environmental Review Improvement Fund.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee fully funds the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council at the level requested in the FY 2019 Budget, allowing the Council to create a more standardized, coordinated, and predictable permitting process that protects public health, safety, and the environment.  Workforce Fund.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact authorizing legislation to establish the President\u2019s Management Council Workforce Fund and urges the Congress to provide appropriations upon its enactment.  The Administration believes it is essential to develop and fund innovative solutions aimed at recruiting, retaining, and rewarding high-performing Federal employees and those with critical skills sets.  Small Business Administration (SBA)  Disaster Loans Program Account.  The Administration is concerned that the bill provides insufficient funding for SBA disaster loan administrative expenses, assuming instead that SBA will rely on balances from appropriations provided in the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (Public Law 115-123, division B, subdivision 1).  These balances are necessary to administer loans to those affected by the major hurricanes that occurred in 2017, and may not be sufficient to allow SBA to continue to provide 5   loans to disasters occurring in 2019.  The Administration believes it makes sense both fiscally and programmatically to provide funds through the regular appropriations process in order to ensure that SBA has the necessary resources to quickly assist homeowners and businesses in disaster recovery.  Other Independent Agencies  Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau).  The Administration is encouraged by the Committee\u2019s inclusion of language that would subject the Bureau to the normal appropriations process beginning in FY 2020, create a dedicated Inspector General, and authorize further congressional review of the Bureau\u2019s rulemaking procedures.    District of Columbia.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for provisions included in the FY 2019 Budget that protect life and religious liberty in Washington, D.C.  Other Provisions  Financial Regulation.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s efforts to build on enactment of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 115-174) by proposing additional pro-growth provisions that would promote lending and access to capital markets for American businesses, homeowners, and consumers.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address several technical changes to facilitate enactment of these provisions, which support the core principles for regulating the United States financial system as set forth in Executive Order 13772.  Criminal Warrant Requirement for Electronic Communications.  The Administration is concerned with section 1002 of the bill, which would require Government entities to obtain a criminal warrant when they seek the content of subscriber emails and other electronic communications from internet service providers.  This statutory change would have operational impacts on civil law enforcement agencies that lack criminal authority, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, and would impede investigations.  Constitutional Concerns  Certain provisions of the bill raise constitutional concerns.  One provision would violate the Appointments Clause, and a number of others would contravene the separation of powers between the Executive Branch and the Congress.  In particular, certain provisions\u2014including one purporting to bar OMB from expending funds to alter the annual work plan of the Army Corps of Engineers\u2014would interfere with the President\u2019s supervision of the Executive Branch.  Others would require congressional committee approval of certain executive actions, in violation of INS v. Chadha, or could infringe on the President\u2019s constitutional authority to control the disclosure of information that is subject to executive privilege.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2019 appropriations process moves forward. 6    * * * * * * * 7   ", "The Administration supports H.R. 3798, the Save American Workers Act of 2018, which would repeal, delay, or replace several harmful provisions of Obamacare.  Protecting American families from the prescriptive requirements and burdensome taxes imposed by Obamacare has been an Administration priority from day one, and this bill would make substantial progress toward fulfilling President Donald J. Trump\u2019s promise to the American people.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare in a fiscally responsible way that protects consumers, expands access to affordable, quality healthcare, and puts patients and doctors at the center of healthcare decisions.   With premiums rising and insurance options dwindling across much of the country, health insurance mandates impose heavy burdens on American families and businesses.  Earlier this year, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, landmark tax reform that eliminated tax penalties on individuals for failing to carry health insurance.  As yet another positive outcome of this change, H.R. 3798 would end the needless and wasteful requirement that companies send out annual certifications of insurance coverage to their employees.   H.R. 3798 also would continue this progress by delaying the employer mandate, which unfairly penalizes certain companies and costs countless American jobs.  The bill would further protect employees by codifying the common understanding that full-time employment is 40 hours per week.  The irresponsible and illogical 30-hour threshold set under Obamacare created a costly dilemma for employers faced with skyrocketing health insurance premiums, and caused many Americans to have their hours cut.    In addition, this bill would delay the so-called Cadillac Tax on high-cost health insurance plans.  Like several other Obamacare taxes, the Cadillac Tax has been delayed several times with bipartisan support.  Finally, H.R. 3798 would repeal Obamacare\u2019s excise tax on indoor tanning services, yet another unnecessary and onerous tax unfairly targeting a specific industry and harming American consumers.  The Save American Workers Act of 2018 would protect American jobs and businesses, put money back into the pockets of American taxpayers, and suspend taxes against certain health insurance plans and businesses.  If H.R. 3798 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.  ** * * * * * ", "The Administration is committed to expanding access to safe and affordable drugs and medical devices through timely reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the Medical Device User Fee Amendments, the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments, and the Biosimilar User Fee Act.  H.R. 2430 would reauthorize these four Food and Drug Administration (FDA) user fee programs, under which companies that develop drugs and medical devices partially pay for FDA's premarket review of their products.  H.R. 2430 also includes a number of provisions to improve FDA's drug review process, including greater use of real-world evidence and enhancing drug development tools such as biomarker development.  FDA's review activities are critical to promoting rapid access to innovative therapies and driving competition toward better healthcare results and lower prices for American consumers.  Improvements in FDA's premarket review process, funded by these user fee programs, have encouraged drug and device makers to expand research and development, leading to advances in medical technology that have saved and improved countless lives.  The President's Budget promotes faster economic growth by lowering taxes and strategically devoting resources to urgent priorities.  To better support FDA's lifesaving mission while carefully spending taxpayer dollars, the President's Budget asks companies that benefit directly from FDA's premarket review of medical products to finance 100 percent of FDA's premarket review.  In its current form, H.R. 2430 would require significant investment of taxpayer resources in FDA's medical product review programs.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide for 100 percent user fee funding within the reauthorized programs.  In an era of renewed fiscal restraint, industries that benefit directly from FDA's work should pay for it.  The Administration is also concerned with certain other provisions in the bill, such as those providing additional market exclusivity to manufacturers, which could make exclusivity unpredictable and decrease competition.  The Administration is committed to promoting the availability of generics in an efficient and effective manner that avoids unintended, adverse consequences.  In addition, there are a number of important technical changes that the Administration seeks to make to the bill, including adjusting the foreign drug facility inspection fee. The Administration supports the goals of H.R. 2430 and looks forward to working with the Congress to expand access to affordable, lifesaving drugs and medical devices in a thoughtful manner that protects taxpayer resources, promotes competition, improves healthcare outcomes, and stimulates scientific innovation and medical advances.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports the Committee\u2019s commitment to include the President\u2019s border wall proposal, which is a critical element of the President\u2019s strategy to secure the borders.  This proposal provides $1.6 billion for physical barrier construction along the southwest border, including $784 million for 32 miles of new border fencing in Rio Grande Valley (RGV), Texas, $498 million for 28 miles of new levee wall in RGV, $251 million for 14 miles of secondary fencing in San Diego, California, and $38 million for program planning and management.  Physical barriers are vital for border security because they deter, prevent, and deny potential illegal border crossings, for illegal alien movement generally and for human smuggling and drug smuggling specifically.  The funding provided in the bill would allow Customs and Border Protection to make critical investments in the areas of the border with the highest current risk and the greatest current operational need.  The Administration strongly supports these efforts.The bill provides $667.7 billion for the Department of Defense, including $74.6 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).  The previous administration signed into law harmful cuts to defense spending.  This Administration strongly supports restoring America\u2019s investment in defense.  To ensure that our military is not rebuilt on the backs of future generations of Americans, however, the Administration strongly supports fiscally responsible reductions to spending elsewhere in the Federal Budget, as outlined in the FY 2018 Budget request.Veterans\u2019 access to timely, high-quality healthcare and services is a top priority, and the Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s provision of $78.3 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a $3.9 billion increase above FY 2017.  This funding supports care for our veterans as well as crucial reforms to the VA to reduce the disability claims backlog and provide greater oversight and accountability. If H.R. 3219 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.  The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share additional views regarding the Committee\u2019s version of the bill.  The Administration may also provide more detail regarding its views in the future, including constitutional concerns, on other provisions. Division A \u2013 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018 Department of Defense (DOD) Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).  The Administration strongly objects to section 8113, which prohibits the use of appropriated funds for proposing, planning, or executing a new BRAC round.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide BRAC authorization as requested so that DOD can ensure it is not wasting resources on unneeded infrastructure.  The Department estimates that a new BRAC round in 2021 would save an additional $2 billion or more annually\u2014resources it could apply to higher priorities such as readiness and modernization.   Palau Compact Funding.  The Administration strongly urges the Congress to include the $124 million requested to fulfill the entire remaining United States financial commitment to the Republic of Palau under the 2010 Compact Review Agreement (CRA).  The CRA requires payment of United States commitments in full to enact the Agreement.  Failure to fund the CRA could imperil ongoing national security initiatives with the Republic of Palau and jeopardize United States access and influence in a region that is increasingly contested by China.   Missile Defense Programs.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $308 million to United States Ballistic Missile Defense programs during a period of escalating threats from North Korea to the homeland and allies of the United States.     Counter-ISIL Train and Equip Fund (CTEF).  The Administration objects to the $112.5 million in rescissions to CTEF.  These reductions would limit DOD\u2019s ability to quickly and effectively provide assistance to partners fighting ISIS, undermining the Administration\u2019s \u201cby, with, and through\u201d strategy to degrade, dismantle, and ultimately defeat ISIS. Coalition Support Fund (CSF).  The Administration objects to the $450 million in reductions, which includes a rescission to CSF.  These reductions would limit DOD\u2019s ability to reimburse key partners in the fight against ISIS and other extremist groups in the region.  The rescission, notably, would reduce funds available for programs that are already underway.  Furthermore, the rescission would inhibit the Executive Branch\u2019s ability to conduct foreign policy, limit the Secretary of Defense\u2019s ability to act in the national security interest of the United States, and unnecessarily complicate relationships with key partners.  Innovation and Enhancing Combat Capability.  The Administration objects to the reduction of $170 million to the Strategic Capabilities Office FY 2018 Budget request.  Specifically, the Administration is concerned that this reduction would add considerable risk to the timely 2  demonstration and transition of critical warfighter capabilities. Division C \u2013 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 Department of Defense Next National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency West (N2W) Campus.  The Administration objects to the Committee\u2019s decision to reduce N2W by $181 million through an incremental funding approach and recommends that funding be provided at the FY 2018 Budget request level.  The Administration is opposed to such use of incremental funding for military construction projects because it undermines program stability and cost discipline and could negatively impact other mission-critical priorities.  In the case of this project, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency expects to obligate the full amount of the Budget request in FY 2018.  Division D \u2013 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 Corps of Engineers Agency Topline.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s investments in the Nation\u2019s water resources through the Corps of Engineers civil works program, but believes that funding should be limited to the amounts requested in the FY 2018 Budget.  The Budget focused on investments to maintain the performance of the key features of existing water resources infrastructure that the Corps owns and operates and the navigation channels that serve the Nation\u2019s largest coastal ports.  It also supports the construction of projects that would provide a high economic or environmental return to the Nation or that would address a significant risk to public safety. Department of Energy Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility Termination.  The Administration strongly objects to continued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility as directed in the bill.  The project is unaffordable and risky.  The most recent estimates, conducted by the Department of Energy and the Corps of Engineers, project $12 billion in remaining construction costs, and total construction costs of $17 billion when including $5 billion in sunk costs to date.  In addition, the projected operating costs are between $800 million and $1 billion per year for nearly two decades.  The alternative\u2014dilute and dispose\u2014is a proven approach with significantly less risk and expense, and can be implemented decades sooner than the MOX approach. Excess Facilities.  The Administration strongly opposes the $150 million reduction to the request to dispose of excess facilities at the Department of Energy sites that are not in the Environmental Management program.  These resources are critical to addressing the increasing risks these facilities pose.  The Administration urges the Congress to provide the requested $225 million to protect the health and safety of workers and the public, and support modernization of the nuclear security enterprise.  3  Nuclear Waste Management (Interim Storage and Yucca Mountain Licensing).  While the Administration supports the inclusion of $120 million for nuclear waste management activities, the Administration strongly opposes the prohibition on using funds appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund for interim storage activities. Applied Energy Programs.  The Administration commends the Committee for beginning to shift the focus of applied energy research and development to earlier-stage activities where the Federal role is strongest, but strongly encourages the Congress to accelerate this shift and further reduce funding for costly later-stage development, commercialization, and deployment activities, some of which are unauthorized.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2018 appropriations process moves forward. * * * * * * * 4  ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of the substitute amendment to H.R. 1892, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.  This amendment raises the defense spending caps for fiscal year (FY) 2018 and FY 2019, a key step toward fulfilling the President\u2019s promise to rebuild America\u2019s military and ensure funding would be provided to support the enacted National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (NDAA). After years of dangerous spending reductions and an unpredictable budgetary environment perpetuated by numerous continuing resolutions, the Bipartisan Budget Act lays the groundwork for full funding of America\u2019s national defense, within the framework of the Administration\u2019s National Security and Defense Strategies and the NDAA. Passage of this legislation would ensure America is prepared to deter and, if necessary, defeat the full spectrum of threats from rival powers, rogue states, and terrorist organizations like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The Bipartisan Budget Act lays the groundwork for higher investments in several Administration priorities, including infrastructure and combating the opioid epidemic, and the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to reflect the Administration\u2019s detailed funding priorities for the remainder of FY 2018 and for FY 2019 for both defense and non-defense needs. At the same time, it is critical that the Congress work to decrease non-defense spending in other areas to reduce America\u2019s growing national debt.  The Bipartisan Budget Act provides non- defense discretionary spending levels higher than the Administration deems necessary. Additionally, although the Bipartisan Budget Act does include some spending reductions, the  Administration has proposed hundreds of billions of dollars in additional spending reductions that the Congress should also enact without delay in order to improve our fiscal state. Further, the Administration recognizes the Congress\u2019s desire to provide significant funding for victims of the recent hurricanes and wildfires, as provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act and previously in the House-passed supplemental bill (H.R. 4667).  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure that adequate oversight is exercised over disaster-related funds to ensure that these funds reach the communities devastated by natural disasters and are not misapplied.  The Administration supports other components of the Bipartisan Budget Act, including greater certainty for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, an extension of funding for Community Health Centers, and repeal of Obamacare\u2019s Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB).  The IPAB authority allows an unelected, unaccountable board to undertake major changes to the Medicare program.  The repeal of IPAB furthers the President\u2019s goal of repealing and replacing  Obamacare.  The Administration also supports suspending the debt limit until March 2019 to provide the certainty to markets around the world that the United States will honor its obligations. Furthermore, the Administration is concerned with future extensions of special interest tax deductions and benefits in the wake of tax cuts and reforms that were enacted in December 2017. The President\u2019s top priority is to keep the Nation safe from those who wish to harm it, both at home and abroad. To do so, the United States military needs the resources provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act, which have previously been supported on a bipartisan basis in the NDAA and in multiple bills passed by the House. If the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign it into law. * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports House passage of the substitute amendment to H.R. 2874, the 21st Century Flood Reform Act.  This legislation ensures timely reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and takes important steps towards common-sense reform.   The Administration endorses provisions of the bill that amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 to expand the private flood insurance market by removing barriers that prevent policyholders from switching between private and Federal flood insurance, and by allowing private flood insurance companies to sell both Federal and private flood insurance.  Additionally, the bill would strengthen the financial outlook of the NFIP by authorizing the program to build up its reserves to pay for future catastrophic flooding events.  H.R. 2874 would require the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to make certain flood risk and claims data publicly available, while protecting personally identifiable information.  Finally, the bill would require property owners to disclose a property\u2019s history of flooding as part of a real estate transaction.  The Administration appreciates the intent behind H.R. 2874, which is to encourage better risk management by the NFIP through the incremental phase-out of certain subsidized policies.  The Administration continues to support more immediate accounting for past repeated flood claims as well as additional measures to expand the private flood insurance market, such as by phasing out the availability of Federal flood insurance for newly constructed buildings and commercial buildings, and by encouraging private risk pooling through reforms to existing law.  Further, the Administration believes that FEMA should retain its current authorities to adjust and increase premiums on properties that should transition to risk-based rates.  Finally, the Administration notes enactment of the requested debt cancellation for the NFIP in H.R. 2266, the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017.  To avoid future taxpayer bailouts of the NFIP, the Administration urges the Congress to pass the substitute amendment to H.R. 2874 and to continue pursuing reforms that will put the program on a more sound and sustainable financial footing.

This rule establishes requirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have an accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student success, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student progress.  While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local control of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas where the ESSA intended broad flexibility.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they implement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

This bipartisan legislation will  lead to the  development of Federal standards to ensure that health care  and social service  employers develop and implement plans to protect their staff, prevent and improve the response to workplace  violence, and address existing barriers to reporting. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, incidents of violence against health care  and social service workers  have been  on the rise.  A 2016 Government Accountability  Office  study reported that rates of violence against health care  workers are up to 12 times higher than rates for the  overall workforce.  In 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that health care  and social service workers were nearly five times as likely to suffer a serious workplace violence injury  than workers in other sectors, and that healthcare  workers accounted for 73 percent of such injuries.   In 2017, state  government health care  and social service  workers were  almost nine  times more likely to be injured by  an assault than private-sector health care workers.  Front line employees in these settings interact with a range of patients, clients, and their families, often with little training  or direction for how to handle interactions that may  become violent.  Workplace violence  often causes both physical and emotional harm.  Victims of these incidents often suffer post-traumatic  stress that undermines  their ability to continue their employment in that sector.  This burdens  a  stretched health care workforce  that has been severely impacted by  the COVID-19 pandemic.   There is currently no Occupational Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA)  standard that requires employers to implement violence prevention plans that  would help reduce workplace violence injuries among health care  and social service workers.  Under the  Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act,  OSHA  must  issue an interim final standard in one  year and a final standard within 42 months requiring employers in the health care  and social service sectors to develop and implement a  workplace violence prevention plan.   Under such a  standard, employers would need to ensure  that health care and social service workers are directly involved in the development, implementation,  and assessment of these plans.   This will include identifying risks, specifying  solutions, and requiring  training, reporting, and incident investigations.  It would also provide protections from retaliation for reporting violent incidents.   Additionally, this legislation will   protect health care  and social service workers in the public sector in 24 states where  those  employees are  not covered by OSHA protections.  The Administration commends the bipartisan support for the  Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care  and Social Service Workers Act  and urges swift passage of this legislation.

Res. 14, a joint resolution providing for  congressional disapproval of the rule \u201cOil and Natural Gas Sector:  Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources Review,\u201d published at 85 Fed. Reg. 57018 (September 14, 2020).  This action would ensure that this rule, which eliminated pollution  standards for methane  emissions from the oil and gas sector and eliminated all emission standards for the transmission and storage segments of that sector, will have no force or effect and reinstate the pollution reduction requirements established under the Clean Air Act in 2012 and 2016.  Addressing methane leaks through detection and repair by using  already cost-effective  technologies  can spur the creation of  good-paying  jobs fixing leaking equipment and pipelines \u2013  all while minimizing waste and reducing this powerful source of pollution.  Today, the oil and gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions  \u2013  a potent climate-disrupting  greenhouse  gas  that is  responsible for approximately one-third of the  global warming and the resulting climate disruption we are already experiencing from climate change.  In order to effectively mitigate climate change, addressing methane pollution from this and other sectors is  an urgent and essential step.  Every American has a fundamental right to  breathe clean air and drink clean water.  These  methane emissions \u2013  leaking during oil and gas production, transmission, and distribution activities \u2013  also contribute to the formation of smog, or ground-level ozone, which is harmful to both human health and agriculture.  Oil and gas production is also a significant emitter of carcinogenic and smog-forming volatile organic compounds into frontline communities.  These  communities, as well as children, the elderly, outdoor workers, and individuals with respiratory  conditions, are at higher risk of experiencing harmful health outcomes due to exposure to such pollution.  Oil and gas pollution can also be carried by the wind and intensify  air pollution problems in communities along that path, including across state boundaries.  The Clean Air Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA)  to protect Americans from dangerous air pollution, including methane  and volatile organic compounds.  Nonetheless, the rule that this  resolution disapproves  of  took four harmful actions that increased  the amount of  harmful pollution to which Americans are exposed:  (1) the elimination of pollution standards for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector; (2) the elimination of all air pollution standards for the transmission and storage segments of the oil and gas sector; (3)  removal of the predicate that establishes EPA\u2019s obligation to address the  extensive methane pollution emitted by existing  sources; and (4) establishment of a new, non-statutory  requirement that EPA make an additional, pollutant-specific finding of significant contribution to endangerment before addressing harmful air pollution from a sector already regulated under the Clean Air Act.  All four of these actions would be reversed by the passage and signature of the resolution.  S.J. Res. 14 will restore robust Clean Air Act pollution standards for this sector, protecting  American communities.  The resolution will also clear the pathway for  EPA to evaluate  opportunities to promulgate even stronger standards under section 111 of the Clean Air Act to address dangerous methane and other pollution from both new and existing sources across the oil and gas sector.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to restore  these critically important pollution standards.   * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly  supports H.R. 2116, the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (CROWN)  Act of 2022.

The President believes that no person should be denied the ability to obtain a job, succeed in school or the  workplace, secure housing, or otherwise exercise their rights based on a hair texture  or hair style.  Over the course of our Nation\u2019s history, society has used hair texture and hairstyle  \u2014  along  with  race, national origin and skin color\u2014  to discriminate  against individuals.   Pernicious forms of systemic racism  persist when dress and grooming  codes, for  example, prohibit hair texture or hairstyle that is commonly associated with a particular race or national origin.  Such discrimination has imposed significant economic costs, learning disruption, and denial of economic opportunities  for people of  color.   Black women, for example, experience  discrimination in hiring because of natural hair styles, and  Black girls experience  disproportionate rates of school discipline, sometimes  for discriminatory hair violations.  Since the President took office,  the Administration has  worked to  advance  equity  and address entrenched disparities that hold people back.  Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity  and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, established that it  is the policy of the  Administration that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing  equity for  all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely  affected by persistent poverty  and inequality.   The  President also signed Executive Order 14020 Establishing  the White House  Gender Policy Council,  and mandating the release  of the first-ever U.S. government strategy to address gender equity and equality.  This strategy  lays out  a vision for  addressing the impact of intersectional discrimination and bias on the basis of gender, race, and other factors, including  those faced by women and girls of color.

H.R. 3684  would reauthorize the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s core  programs that support investments in roads, bridges, safety, transit, rail, freight, and multimodal projects, and in research and innovation.  The bill  seeks to modernize and transform these programs with a focus on safety, climate, equity, and good-paying jobs.   In addition, H.R. 3684  would establish a number of programs aligned with the President\u2019s vision, including  programs that would support electric vehicle charging  infrastructure, expand intercity  passenger rail, strive to ensure  safe  streets for all, reconnect communities, and improve  resilience  to the impacts of climate change.  Furthermore, the bill would provide dedicated resources for low-income  communities and require  consideration of  equity and environmental justice in funding decisions.  The bill also includes important provisions to support  domestic manufacturing, prevailing wages, registered apprenticeships, and other labor protections.  H.R. 3684 aligns  with the Administration\u2019s goals to upgrade and modernize aging  water  infrastructure  and prioritize lead service line replacements, which reduces exposure to lead, a  neurotoxin that is especially harmful to children.  The bill  would help the Environmental   Protection Agency (EPA) partner with communities on the frontlines of protecting public health and the environment.  H.R. 3684 would reinvigorate  the EPA\u2019s  drinking water and wastewater  programs, authorize  much-needed funding to  support  small and disadvantaged communities, and address challenges associated with climate change  and emerging contaminants.   The  Administration supports efforts to improve public  health by taking steps to  reduce  exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and is pressing forward with targeted actions in its regulatory agenda to achieve this goal.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this bill, which lays a strong  foundation for achieving  the President\u2019s vision on infrastructure.    * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration  supports House passage of H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021.  This  legislation  would provide  farmworkers  who are invaluable to our economy  and have lived in this country for  years - in some cases for decades  - an opportunity to earn citizenship.  A path to immigration status for undocumented farmworkers is critically important to our  Nation\u2019s food and agriculture sectors.  A majority  of the  Nation\u2019s roughly 2.4 million farmworkers are undocumented, living  in the shadows, and vulnerable to exploitation, including  human trafficking.  During the pandemic, these workers have risked their lives, harvesting  fruits  and  vegetables and raising and caring  for livestock to bring food to our tables. With legal status and a path to citizenship, farmworkers would be  able to earn higher wages  and  exercise their rights under our labor laws to demand better working conditions.  In turn, businesses that rely on farmworkers would have a  more reliable  and stable workforce.  The Administration recognizes the need to improve the H-2A program.  As  this legislation  moves  forward, the Administration urges  the Congress to strike  a balance between the proposed  expansion of the H-2A visa program and increased protections for farm workers to prevent  abuse, which has marked the existing program.  The Administration also  urges  the Congress to reform other aspects of our  immigration system by passing the U.S. Citizenship Act, which would  provide a path to citizenship to millions of  undocumented immigrants, establish a new system to responsibly manage and secure our border, bring long overdue visa reforms to keep families together and grow our  economy, and address  the root causes of  instability and unsafe conditions causing  migration  from Central America.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to create an earned pathway to  citizenship for farmworkers.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly  supports House passage of H.R. 1065, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   Pregnant workers  are too often unable to access simple changes to their working  conditions that would allow them to keep doing their jobs and do so safely.   This can create risks to their health as well as economic consequences.  No worker should be forced to choose  between a paycheck and a healthy pregnancy.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would provide basic, long overdue protections to ensure that pregnant workers and job applicants are not fired or otherwise discriminated against, or denied reasonable  accommodations  that allow them to work.  Such protections  promote  family  economic security  by helping women stay in the workforce, including for  those, often women of  color, who are  the sole or primary breadwinners  in their families.  Approximately two million women have left the workforce due to the COVID-19 pandemic, eroding more than 30 years of  progress in women\u2019s labor force participation, and this Administration is committed  to ensuring  that women can both care for and support themselves and their families.  H.R. 1065 is a bipartisan bill that requires certain employers to make reasonable accommodations for qualified employees and job applicants with known limitations related to  pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.  These accommodations might include simple modifications, such as modifying a no-food-or-drink policy, providing additional break time to use the bathroom, or helping avoid the lifting of heavy objects, depending on the circumstances.  The bill would require employers to provide reasonable accommodations for qualified pregnant workers unless doing so would pose an undue hardship to the employer.  It would also provide for an interactive process, where necessary, between employers and pregnant workers to determine appropriate and effective reasonable accommodations, and would protect pregnant workers from being denied employment opportunities, or from retaliation or interference, because they request or use an accommodation.  The Administration encourages the House to pass this bipartisan, commonsense legislation and looks forward to working with the Congress to protect pregnant workers across the country.   ", "The Administration supports Senate  passage of S. 1260, the  Endless Frontier  Act.   This bipartisan legislation is an important step in ensuring the U.S. remains globally competitive in the 21st  century.   As our Nation  works to recover from the worst economic and public health crises of our lifetimes, now is the time to make  these  major investments in our long-term economic resilience  and competitiveness.    S. 1260  is aligned with the President\u2019s vision to build  a  stronger, more inclusive  innovation engine in the United States.  It  would strengthen U.S. innovation ecosystems through new investments in research, commercialization, and manufacturing. S. 1260  would  authorize  historic investments in critical science  and engineering  research, from artificial intelligence  to advanced energy, including  through  a new directorate of the National Science  Foundation (NSF).   The legislation would promote economic  equity  through the creation of a Chief Diversity Officer at the NSF  and  support for broadening participation in  STEM education.   S. 1260 would  also build on the Federal government\u2019s existing  innovation infrastructure, including  support for the Department of Energy and the  National Labs.   It  would strengthen scientific research and technology commercialization activities at academic institutions across the country.   S. 1260  would strengthen U.S. manufacturing  and create manufacturing jobs, and would authorize  increased  investments in Manufacturing  USA Institutes and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership.  This legislation  would  help  bring  new jobs in manufacturing  and high-tech sectors to more communities around the country  by  authorizing investments  in regional technology  hubs. Finally, S. 1260  would take  an important  step toward improving our supply chain resilience  through the creation of a  program at the Department of Commerce to monitor  and analyze  critical supply  chains and  help reduce supply  chain vulnerabilities in the face of major  disruptions.  This program would include support for  semiconductor manufacturing and research, which, if funded, would  strengthen U.S. global leadership in the semiconductor industry.  The Administration applauds these steps to strengthen our economic  competitiveness by  authorizing  investment  in our R&D capabilities and manufacturing base  in a diverse set of U.S. regions  and communities.   We look forward to  working with  the  Congress  on  further  improvements as this legislation progresses,  including taking steps to fund these critical priorities.   * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration  strongly supports  House passage of H.R. 4502, making  appropriations for the  Departments of  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and related  agencies;  Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and related  agencies;  energy and water development,  and related  agencies;  financial services and  general  Government;  the Department of the  Interior,  Environment, and related  agencies;  military construction, the  Department of  Veterans  Affairs,  and related agencies; and the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies  for the fiscal  year  (FY)  ending September  30, 2022, and for other purposes.  Over the past decade, due in large measure to overly restrictive budget  caps, the Nation  significantly underinvested in core priorities  such as  education, research, and public health that  are vital to our prosperity and strength.  We have  seen the consequences of this broad disinvestment in our lack of preparedness to effectively respond to a  global  pandemic.  We see it  in global competitors that are catching up or even surpassing the  United States in research and development.  In addition, we see it in longstanding inequities that have been deepened by  chronic underinvestment in programs that are drivers of opportunity, such as Head Start and K-12 education.  These cuts to public investment in basic services and protections have cost us all\u2014and the moment to begin reversing this troubling trend is now.  The Administration is eager to incorporate the best ideas to reinvest in America.   What we cannot  accept is a continuation of damaging and self-defeating disinvestment.   Instead, we must seize this moment to invest in our future\u2014building  an economy that works for  everyone, not just those  at the top; tackling the  generational challenge of  climate change; competing with rising powers  and maintaining our position as  a global leader; and preparing for the full range of  challenges and  opportunities ahead of us.  The President\u2019s  FY 2022 Budget details a  robust set of discretionary proposals to help deliver that  future by reinvesting in the foundations of our  Nation\u2019s strength.  The  Administration strongly  supports the House Appropriations Committee in putting forth FY  2022 bills that reflect these  shared priorities.   The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share  additional views regarding the  Committee\u2019s version of the bill. Division  A\u2014Departments of  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and  Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2022 Department of  Labor (DOL)  Worker Protection.  The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for DOL\u2019s  worker  protection agencies, which would allow the Department to rebuild these agencies\u2019 staffing levels  and better protect the health, safety, wages, rights, and benefits of  America\u2019s workers.   Apprenticeship.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s funding  in the bill for the  expansion of Registered Apprenticeship and efforts to increase access to the model for historically  underrepresented groups.   Unemployment Insurance  (UI) Administration.  The Administration appreciates the funding  provided in the bill to expand State grants for  UI  administration, accommodating workload increases and allowing the Department to fully modernize the funding formula for the first time in  decades.   Further, the Administration appreciates the critical support for UI  National Activities,  which would help modernize information technology and support States in administering the UI  program.   Department of  Health and Human Services  (HHS)  Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).   The Administration appreciates that the bill provides initial funding to establish ARPA-H so it can begin its important and transformative work  to improve human health.  However, the  Administration is disappointed that the bill provides  significantly  less than the  level  requested in the FY 2022 Budget and that the  funding is contingent on future congressional  action.  The Administration looks forward to working  with the Congress to ensure that ARPA-H is funded at  levels commensurate with its bold mission.   It is critical that ARPA-H is established and operational in FY 2022 so the agency  can rapidly undertake  its life-saving work in such critical areas as  cancer, infectious diseases, and  Alzheimer\u2019s  for the benefit  of all Americans.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Topline.   The  Administration appreciates that the bill fully  funds the FY 2022 Budget request for CDC.  This funding would help restore  capacity  at the world\u2019s preeminent public health agency, address health disparities, support  community violence prevention, and promote health equity among other critical public health needs.  Building on the investments in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, this funding would help CDC support core public health capacity improvements in States and Territories, modernize  public health data collection nationwide, train new epidemiologists and other public health experts, and build international capacity to detect, prepare for, and respond to emerging  global  threats and the current COVID-19 pandemic.  2 Ending the Opioid Epidemic.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides robust  funding to address the opioid overdose  epidemic, which has worsened in the COVID-19 pandemic.  CDC preliminary data  estimates there  were over 93,000 deaths  related to drug  overdoses in 2020, of which nearly 70,000 were  related to opioid use, and the funding requested in the FY 2022 Budget request would increase access to prevention, treatment, and creates  a new  10 percent set aside in the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment  Block Grant for recovery  support services.  Ending the HIV Epidemic.  The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the  FY 2022 Budget request for Ending the HIV Epidemic.  This funding would help aggressively  reduce new  HIV cases while increasing access to  treatment, expanding the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis, also known as PrEP, and promoting equitable  access to services and support.   Community Mental Health Services Block Grant.   The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the  FY 2022 Budget request for the Community Mental Health Services  Block Grant.   This historic investment would help address the strains on the Nation\u2019s mental healthcare system, which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Strategic National Stockpile (SNS).  The Administration appreciates that the bill fully funds the  FY 2022 Budget request  for the SNS.  The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an extraordinary  strain on the SNS and this funding would allow  for the replenishment of  critical materiel and preparation for the next public health emergency.   Syringe Services Program.   The Administration appreciates that the bill does not place any  restrictions on the use of  Federal funds for syringe services programs  and sterile syringes.  These proven and effective community-based prevention programs provide  a range of services, including linkage to infectious disease care  and substance use treatment.   Child Welfare Funding and Equity Grants.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s strong  funding for child welfare and child abuse prevention programs, especially the inclusion of  $100 million to create a new competitive grant program to advance equity  and reduce racial  disproportionalities in the child welfare system.  This funding would help State and local child welfare agencies partner  with education, health, and early childhood agencies and with community stakeholders to engage in a  continuous improvement cycle to advance  equity while  safely reducing the number of children who enter foster care by re-orienting child welfare systems  to a prevention-first model.  Early Childhood Education.  The Administration appreciates the funding included for the Child Care and Development  Block Grant, Head Start, and Preschool Development Grants, which total  over $20 billion and represent a $3.1 billion increase over the FY 2021 enacted level.  These  investments would expand access to high-quality,  affordable child care and  early learning  programs for children from low-income households that would foster healthy  development and improve outcomes later in life.  Family Violence.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s full support of the  Administration\u2019s FY 2022 Budget request for increased funding  for the  Family  Violence  3 Prevention and Services program and National Domestic Violence Hotline, as well as cash assistance for survivors of domestic violence.    Refugee Resettlement.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of funding to rebuild refugee resettlement infrastructure after  years of neglect and to provide social services,  time-limited cash, and medical assistance to resettle up to 125,000 refugees in FY 2022.   Department of Education (Education)   Overall Education Funding.  The Administration appreciates the strong funding support in the bill  for public schools, colleges, and universities with the inclusion of the full FY 2022 Budget  request of $102.8 billion.  This historic investment would help the Nation build back better and lay the  foundation for shared growth and prosperity for decades to come.   Title I.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s historic increase of $19.5 billion for the  Title  I program, which would provide critical support to students and teachers in high poverty  schools.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on ways to advance  shared priorities, including improving educator compensation and improving the  equity  and adequacy of State and local school finance systems.  Special Education.  The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of over $17 billion  for  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) programs.  The additional funding would support special education and related services for  over 7.6 million students  with disabilities and is  a significant step toward fully funding  IDEA.  The  bill also makes critical reforms to the  IDEA  Infants and Families program to expand access to early intervention services for underserved children, including  children of color  and children from low-income families.      School Counselors, Nurses and Psychologists.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  inclusion of $1 billion toward increasing the number of school  counselors, nurses, and psychologists.  The bill splits the funding into two existing education programs, with $500 million  to School-based Mental  Health Services  Grants and $500 million to Mental Health Professional  Demonstration Grants.  This investment would help support the mental health and well-being of  the Nation\u2019s students, teachers, and school staff  as they navigate their new  normal given  all the  COVID-19 pandemic disruptions.   Full Service Community  Schools.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of  $443 million toward the  Full-Service Community  Schools program.  Community schools have  and will continue to play  a critical role in providing comprehensive  wrap-around services during  and after the COVID-19 pandemic.  This additional support would allow for the creation of an estimated 800 new community schools serving up to 2.4 million additional students, families, and community members.    Fostering Diverse Schools.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of  $100 million for this new competitive grant program, which would help communities develop and implement strategies to build more diverse student bodies.   4 Pell Grants.  The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s $400 increase to the maximum Pell Grant, for  a new maximum award of $6,895, and the expansion of eligibility  for Pell Grants to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and those with temporary  protected status.  The  Administration also appreciates the increase of $2.3 billion in funding to support the  approximately seven  million Pell recipients.     Student Aid Administration.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s $200 million increase to  Student Aid Administration, the account that supports the administration of the Federal student  financial assistance programs.  These programs, that help students and families pay  for the cost of  post-secondary education, are the Nation\u2019s largest source of  financial  aid for post-secondary  students.  This increase is also critical to ensuring safe and  effective loan servicing for over  40 million Federal student loan borrowers and to implement the necessary  requirements in the  FAFSA Simplification Act and the FUTURE Act.    Social Security Administration (SSA)   Limitation on Administrative Expenses.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s funding  for SSA\u2019s frontline operations to improve customer service  and address  the disability claims  backlog.   Corporation for National and Community Service   AmeriCorps.  The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s strong support for national service  through the  funding increases for AmeriCorps.  This additional funding would allow the agency  to increase its support for volunteers across the Nation, improving the lives of people served while building an ethic of national service.   National Labor  Relations Board   National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  funding for the NLRB, which would allow the agency to rebuild its staffing and support  meaningful improvements in the protection of collective bargaining  rights nationally.   Constitutional  Concerns   One provision of the draft bill raises separation of  powers concerns, including by conditioning the  Executive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval of the House and Senate  Committees on Appropriations.  The Administration looks forward to working with  the Congress  to address these  and other concerns.        5 Division B\u2014Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Act, 2022  Department of  Agriculture (USDA)   Climate and Clean Energy.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s recognition that new funding is needed to respond to the climate crisis.  The bill provides $347 million in new  investments across USDA, including many of the requested increases for  climate change and  clean energy.   The Administration would like to work with the Congress to ensure, as the bill  moves through the process, that there is adequate  funding for Rural Cooperative Assistance, to help rural communities accelerate to a carbon pollution free electricity sector by 2035, for  transitioning the USDA fleet to electric vehicles, and new climate funding requested for the  Agriculture Research Service to support the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Climate  that would support USDA technology needs including  heat- and drought-resistant food and agriculture  supply chain.  Special Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children.  The Administration  appreciates that the Committee provided $6 billion in new budget authority  to address the  nutritional needs of pregnant and postpartum women, infants, toddlers, and young children and to support science-backed nutrition recommendations for 6.4 million participants.    StrikeForce Initiative.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s funding for the new  StrikeForce initiative at the requested level, which would allow USDA to leverage its extensive  network of county-based offices for community outreach.    Rural Broadband.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for rural broadband.  The bill provides $137 million above the FY 2022 Budget request for the ReConnect Program and refinancing budget authority for telecommunication loans, equal to the FY  2022 Budget request  that would help rural providers deploy future-proof technology, while lowering the  cost for  consumers.    Rural Housing Programs.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee funded the  requested  increases for the rural single-family homeownership direct loans, funded at $1.5 billion and loan guarantees funded at $30 billion, as well as rental assistance and housing vouchers at  $1.5 billion.  The funding would provide approximately 182,000 loans  and loan guarantees, and allow USDA to continue  the necessary level of assistance to low income homebuyers, giving  them opportunities to improve their living  conditions and financial footing  through investment in their own neighborhoods.   Rural  Water and Wastewater Grants and Loans.  The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s support for rural water and wastewater  grants and loans, particularly the increases  for  grants targeted to Colonias, Native Americans, and Alaskan Native Villages as well as  other  rural communities, many of whom disproportionately lack access to quality water and sewer  infrastructure.    6 Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s full funding for FSIS inspectors, which would allow the agency to continue to meet the demands of its  critical food safety mission.     Department of  Health and Human Services   Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided by  the Committee to support a number of  agency initiatives, including targeted increases to several  priorities in the FY 2022 Budget request, such as  emerging  chemical  and toxicology issues, drug  safety surveillance and oversight,  and medical device supply  chain resilience.   The Administration  would like to work with the Congress to ensure, as the bill moves through the  process, that there is adequate funding for:   maternal and infant health and nutrition;  efforts  to address the opioid crisis;  and critical public health infrastructure needs, including capacity  building and enterprise-wide data-modernization in order  to revitalize FDA\u2019s outdated data  infrastructure and support fundamental FDA operations to keep pace with new requirements and regulatory responsibilities as requested in the  FY  2022 Budget.      Constitutional  Concerns   Certain provisions of the  bill raise separation of powers concerns, including  by conditioning the  Executive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval of the House and Senate  Committees on Appropriations.  Other provisions would unduly interfere  with the President\u2019s  ability to supervise the  Executive Branch.  The Administration looks forward to working with the  Congress to address these and other  concerns.    Division C\u2014Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act,  2022  Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)   Corps Topline.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the Army Corps  Civil Works  program.   The Administration also appreciates the commitment to climate resilient water infrastructure.     Department of Energy (DOE)   Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Topline.  The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s robust support for EERE, a top Administration priority, at over  $900 million above FY 2021 enacted level.  EERE would play  a key role in achieving the  President\u2019s goals of a  carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and a net zero economy by  2050, all while creating  good-paying jobs and building a more equitable  economy.  Not only does  EERE drive innovation across renewables, buildings, vehicles, manufacturing, and fuels, it also helps weatherize homes in underserved communities and ensure that the Federal Government is  an environmental steward across its physical footprint.  The Administration appreciates that the  Committee  is funding several new programs within EERE, including the Build Back Better  7 Challenge Grants, Weatherization Readiness Fund, and  Local Government  Clean Energy  Workforce Program, but strongly urges the Congress to provide the full levels  requested in the  FY  2022 Budget for these programs.  The Administration looks forward to working with the  Congress in maximizing the impact of these investments, as well as exploring what more could be  done to meet critical climate  goals.     Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and Advanced Research Projects Agency-Climate (ARPA-C).   The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for    ARPA-E at  $173 million above the FY 2021 enacted level, a key program that has proven effective at  identifying and supporting revolutionary energy technologies that  enhance the Nation\u2019s economic  and energy security.  The  Administration  continues to believe that the establishment of an ARPA\u2013 C would enable more effective cross Government  collaboration that would lead to the development of innovative climate solutions.  The Administration looks forward to working  with the Congress on this urgent issue.   National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).  The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s strong support for national security by  providing a  robust level of funding  for  DOE\u2019s NNSA, commensurate with the President\u2019s FY 2022 Budget request.  The Administration is concerned, however, that certain provisions of the bill appear to pre-judge the outcome of the  Nuclear Posture Review  (NPR) now underway.  As the Administration works to reduce the role  of nuclear weapons in the national security strategy, it looks forward to working with the  Congress to ensure that the most critical elements  of the nuclear modernization program are  fully  funded and that the  FY 2022 funding levels do not constrain policy options available for  consideration by the President in the NPR.     Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED).  The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s support for establishing the OCED.  The OCED would serve as the Department\u2019s  hub for accelerating the  maturation of near- and mid-term clean energy technologies  and systems  with the goal of quicker  commercial adoption and increased availability.  The OCED would accomplish this through  a systematic approach  that is informed by,  and integrated with, existing  clean energy innovation initiatives across DOE\u2019s diverse program and functional offices, sites and associated National  Laboratories.   The OCED would also be instrumental in executing the  demonstration portfolio envisioned by the Energy  Act of 2020.    Equity and Justice.  The  Administration appreciates that the Committee recognizes the  importance of increasing  engagement with communities impacted by  climate change, air and  water pollution, systemic racism and underinvestment, high energy costs, and economic  inequality.  The  Administration urges the Congress to support requested resources for the  Environmental Management program toward this goal for Historically  Black Colleges and Universities and other Minority Serving  Institutions.     Indian Energy.  The  Administration appreciates that the bill provides $70 million for the Office of  Indian Energy, a tripling  of the program over the prior  year, needed to make substantial progress  in achieving universal  energy access for  Indian country and for transitioning the Nation\u2019s tribal  colleges and universities to renewable energy.  While more opportunities may  exist to advance  8 access to all communities equitably, this investment represents  a significant step forward in achieving such equity in Indian country and tribal communities.    The Office of Nuclear Energy (NE).   The Administration appreciates the $1.8 billion provided in the bill for NE.  The investments in the bill would allow for nuclear energy  to play a  critical role in combating climate  change through the demonstration of advanced reactors, creating  good-paying jobs in advanced manufacturing, and securing the Nation\u2019s place  as  the global leader in nuclear science and technology.   The Administration  also  urges the Congress to continue funding  for the Versatile Test Reactor Project,  an essential tool for America to  regain its global nuclear  energy leadership role in the development of advanced reactors.    Loan Programs.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for administrative  expenses necessary to run the loan programs and deploy  available loan authority to advance its  climate goals.  The Administration urges the  Congress to reconsider appropriating additional  credit subsidy  and loan authority for the  Title 17 program to support innovative electric vehicle  infrastructure, carbon management, and other clean energy projects that create  good paying jobs  with a free and fair choice to join a union.    Department of  Interior   Bureau of Reclamation.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides a net of  $1.9 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Central Utah Project, $413 million, or 28 percent, above the  FY 2022 Budget request.  The Administration also appreciates the funding  for Reclamation, which would benefit the western water infrastructure and improve the Nation\u2019s  climate resiliency, particularly in this time of severe drought.     Indian Water Rights Settlements.   The Administration appreciates that the bill fully  funds the  request for  Indian Water  Rights Settlements.  The Administration  looks forward to working with the Congress on a proposal to reclassify  as mandatory  funding the amounts necessary to meet  Federal commitments for existing enacted  Indian  Water Rights Settlements starting in FY 2023.   This would provide a stable and comprehensive funding source to meet these legal requirements  to Tribes.   Constitutional  Concerns   Sections 101 and 201 of the bill would raise separation of powers concerns  by conditioning the  Executive\u2019s authority to reprogram funds on receiving the approval of the  House and Senate  Committees on Appropriations.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress  to address this and other  concerns.          9 Division D\u2014Financial  Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2022  Department of the Treasury   Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the  IRS.  The investments in the bill would enable increased oversight of high-income and corporate tax returns, new and improved online tools for better communication between taxpayers and the  IRS, and improved taxpayer customer service\u2014including outreach and assistance to underserved communities.    Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  (FinCEN).  The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s support for FinCEN.  The additional  resources provided in the bill to create a  database that tracks the ownership and control of certain companies  and organizations would help combat the use of  complex corporate structures to shield illegal activity.    Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund.  The Administration appreciates  the Committee\u2019s support for increased investments in CDFI programs that flow to communities  and geographic areas where access to capital is most needed, including rural areas and persistent  poverty counties.   Executive Office of the President   Office of Management and Budget  (OMB).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for additional funding to invest in the career OMB workforce that  is charged with helping  the President meet policy, budget, management, and regulatory objectives in an effective  and efficient manner.  The  Administration also shares the Committee\u2019s goal of increasing spending  transparency.  However, the Administration objects to sections 204, 747, and 749 of the bill  which would impose new requirements, limitations, and conditions related to the thousands of  apportionment actions  processed by OMB each  year.  These requirements would undermine  OMB\u2019s ability to ensure the effective implementation of the law, and efficient use of taxpayer  resources.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure appropriate  levels of transparency  while also preserving  the Executive Branch\u2019s role in funds management.   The Administration  also objects to the inclusion of previously enacted provisions that are  unnecessarily  restrictive, such as one purporting to bar OMB from expending funds to alter the  annual work plan of the  Army Corps of Engineers.    General Services  Administration (GSA)   Federal Buildings Fund (FBF).  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the  Federal  Buildings Fund, including the Climate and Resilience Special Emphasis Program, and applauds the Committee\u2019s efforts to reinstate the capital program.  However, the Administration  urges the Congress to provide full funding for the  FBF at the  anticipated level of rent collections, as proposed in the  FY 2022 Budget request, which would support priority repair and alteration projects as well as new construction projects.   10 Electric Vehicles  Fund.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for the  requested $300 million at GSA to support the Administration\u2019s goal of electrifying the Federal  fleet.  The Electric Vehicles Fund provides the mechanism for GSA to procure zero emission and electric vehicles and the associated charging infrastructure on behalf of  Federal agencies.    Technology Modernization Fund (TMF).  The Administration appreciates the funding provided in the bill for the TMF and urges the Congress to provide the full $500 million  requested in the  FY  2022 Budget, which would support a more rapid transition of legacy systems and the adoption of  more secure commercial  technology.  With $1 billion in seed funding  appropriated through the  American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the TMF  Board has received more than 100 proposals from  agencies totaling over $2.1 billion in requested funds, far exceeding the  amount of resources  available.    Small Business Administration (SBA)   Entrepreneurial Development Programs.  The Administration  appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for the proposed investments in counseling and training targeted to underserved small  businesses and innovation programs.  The  funds provided in the bill would enable SBA to expand access to free technical assistance services to help small businesses start, grow, and recover.   Office of Personnel Management (OPM)   Salaries and Expenses.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for an additional  $42 million at OPM to strengthen its workforce, improve information technology (IT), address  administrative funding  gaps resulting  from the transfer of the background investigations program  to the Department of  Defense, and reassert OPM\u2019s policymaking leadership responsibilities.   IT  Working Capital Fund.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the  necessary transfer authority requested to operationalize an IT Working Capital Fund at OPM and urges the Congress to also support transfer  authority at other  agencies to enable broader adoption of the funding flexibilities authorized by the Modernizing Government Technology provisions  enacted in the  National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.   Other  Independent Agencies   Election Assistance Commission (EAC) Election Security Grants.  The Administration appreciates  the Committee\u2019s support for the EAC and is committed to working with the Congress to modernize America\u2019s elections system and make those systems more secure.   Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Funding.  The  Administration appreciates  the Committee\u2019s  support for the FTC at the FY 2022 Budget request level of $390 million, which would support  antitrust investigations and consumer protections.    Other Provisions   Supervision of the Executive Branch.  The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  11 recognition of the crucial role played by the  Federal workforce and their employee  rights, but is  concerned that the telework specific portion in section 750 of the bill may  impede the President\u2019s  ability to manage Executive Branch functions.     Constitutional  Concerns   Certain provisions of the  draft bill raise separation of powers  concerns, including by conditioning  the Executive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval  of the House and Senate Committees on  Appropriations.  Other provisions would unduly interfere with the  President\u2019s ability to supervise the Executive  Branch.  The Administration looks forward to working  with the Congress to address these and other concerns.    Division E\u2014Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act, 2022  Department of the  Interior (DOI)   Tribal Programs.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support of DOI\u2019s tribal programs, including funding to support tribal students and teachers, tribal law enforcement, tribal clean energy development, and tribal land consolidation.    Land Management Operations.  The Administration appreciates the bill\u2019s support for DOI\u2019s land management operations,  which are critical to strengthening climate resilience and  conservation  partnerships and investing in healthy lands  and waters that would create jobs and improve the  economies of energy communities across the Nation.     Sage Grouse.  The  Administration is pleased that the bill supports sage  grouse conservation efforts at the  Bureau of  Land Management and removes the statutory  restriction on listing the  sage  grouse under the Endangered Species Act.     Indian Water Rights Settlements.  The  Administration appreciates that the bill funds  Indian Land and Water Claim Settlements at the level requested in the FY 2022  Budget.  The Administration  looks forward to working with the Congress on a proposal to reclassify  as mandatory funding for  payments for enacted Indian Water Rights Settlements beginning in FY 2023, which would create  a stable, comprehensive funding source to meet these legal requirements to Tribes.    DOI  and Department of  Agriculture (USDA), Forest Service   Wildland Fire Management.  The Administration appreciates that the bill supports wildland fire  management efforts at both departments, notably for hazardous fuels management and wildfire  suppression\u2014via the wildfire cap adjustment.  Within DOI, the Administration is also pleased  that the bill provides necessary resources for burned area rehabilitation projects and for the  increase in funding  for the Joint Fire Science program.  Within USDA, the bill supports the  Administration\u2019s request  for the Salaries  and Expenses account to fund staffing level increases  12 needed to achieve performance targets for hazardous fuel projects, and  for  preparedness increases  to fund unmanned aerial  systems, risk management assistance, and technology modernization.    Great American Outdoors Act.  The Administration appreciates that the bill supports projects  identified by DOI and USDA for funding under the Great American Outdoors Act, and looks  forward to working with the Congress to execute projects in a timely  and results-oriented manner.    Department of  Health and Human Services   Indian Health Service  (IHS).  The Administration appreciates the funding increase provided by  the Committee to carry out the  IHS\u2019  critical work  in providing high-quality and comprehensive  health services.  However, the Administration is concerned that the bill does not contain the  requested advance appropriation for FY 2023, which is a tribal priority.  The Administration urges the Congress to enact the FY 2022 Budget request\u2019s proposal for advance  appropriations in FY 2023, which would provide funding and certainty to Tribal Health Programs, Urban Indian Organizations, and IHS federally-operated health programs in the event of  continuing resolutions  or other funding delays that affect continuity of patient care services and otherwise create barriers  to providing high-quality healthcare services for American  Indians and Alaska Natives.      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)   EPA Topline.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides $11.3 billion for EPA\u2019s  topline, $111 million above the FY 2022 Budget request.  This robust funding would support the  agency\u2019s mission to protect human health and the environment.     EPA Operating Budget.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides $4.3 billion for  EPA\u2019s operating budget.  This funding level would support EPA staffing  efforts, restoring and expanding the agency\u2019s  ability to carry out its duties and functions.  It is important to ensure  sufficient funds are available for EPA to provide  appropriate management of grants and of the  Agency as  a whole.    Environmental Justice.  The Administration appreciates that the bill provides $892 million above  the FY 2021 enacted level toward a new Accelerating Environmental  and Economic Justice  initiative at EPA.  This funding level would support initiatives that create  good-paying union jobs, clean up pollution, and secure  environmental justice for  communities that have been left behind.    Water Infrastructure.  The Administration appreciates the $3.6 billion included in the bill for  EPA\u2019s water infrastructure programs.  This grant  and loan funding would support critical drinking  water and  wastewater infrastructure investments.     Biomass Energy.  The Administration appreciates that the bill removes the requirement for EPA,  DOE, and USDA to treat forest biomass as carbon neutral.  This would allow the agencies to determine and account  for the net biogenic  carbon dioxide  emissions effects of using forest biomass fuels for energy.      13 Constitutional  Concerns   Certain provisions of the  draft bill raise constitutional issues, including by conditioning the  Executive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval of the House and Senate  Committees on Appropriations and by mandating  certain legislative recommendations.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other  concerns.    Division F\u2014Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations  Act, 2022   Department of  Defense (DOD)   Detainee Matters.   The  Administration appreciates that the bill does not include language  prohibiting the use of  funds to construct, renovate, or expand any facility in the United States to house individuals held in the detention facility at  Guantanamo Bay.  Such provisions  have historically constrained the flexibility that the Nation\u2019s Armed Forces  and  counterterrorism professionals need to best protect U.S. national security  and intruded on the Executive Branch\u2019s  ability to carry out its missions.    Reprioritization of Military Construction Funding to Unrequested Projects.  The bill proposes to incrementally fund 12 military construction projects, creating an unfunded obligation of  $968 million needed to complete these projects in future  years.  The Administration  looks  forward  to working with the Congress to ensure incremental funding does not endanger completion of  these projects or  raise the projected  cost.   Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA)   Agency Topline.  The  Administration appreciates the $113.1 billion in discretionary  appropriations that the Committee provides for VA.  This level would enable the Administration to deliver critical investments in high-priority initiatives and infrastructure that would ensure veterans receive top quality care, benefits, and services\u2014wherever they work or live.  It would support key  Administration priorities such as veteran suicide and opioid abuse prevention programs, mental healthcare, and women\u2019s healthcare, while providing the resources needed to  assist VA in continuing to address the  challenges  presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The  level provided would also allow investments in other critical priorities, including homelessness  assistance, infrastructure readiness, electronic health record modernization, information technology  enhancements, and efforts to ensure that VA engrains diversity, equity, and inclusion into the fabric of the  Department.   In addition, the  Administration appreciates that the bill continues to give VA the flexibility to provide veterans with the robust array  of medical care  services they deserve.   Related Agencies   Support for Arlington National Cemetery.   The Administration appreciates that the Committee  provided $141 million for the Southern Expansion project at Arlington National Cemetery  14 (ANC), as requested in the FY 2022 Budget.  This funding would ensure  ANC continues to honor  the service and sacrifice  of those laid to rest at ANC and their families by  expanding the  cemetery\u2019s space and  capacity  well into the future.    Constitutional  Concerns   Certain provisions of the  draft bill raise separation of powers  concerns, including by conditioning  the Executive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval  of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.  The Administration looks forward to working  with the  Congress to address these and other  concerns.     Division G\u2014Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act, 2022  Department of Transportation (DOT)   Overall Infrastructure Investment Levels.   The Administration strongly supports the bill\u2019s  significant investments to improve the Nation\u2019s infrastructure, which is aligned with the  Administration\u2019s goals to repair  and rebuild aging  infrastructure, reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions, improve resilience to the  effects of climate change, and invest in disadvantaged communities.  The bill provides $72 billion in highway, highway safety, and transit formula  funds, equal to the House Transportation Committee\u2019s \u201cINVEST\u201d  Act surface transportation authorization bill.    Federal Aviation Administration.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provided  $18.9 billion for Federal  Aviation Administration programs, including $11.4 billion for the safe  operation of the National Airspace System (NAS), $3.75 billion in nationwide airport  infrastructure investments, $1 billion for NAS facilities upgrades and replacements, and $261 million for emerging technology innovation and climate change mitigation research.    Federal Transit Administration.  The Administration appreciates the $15.5 billion provided in the  bill for public transportation programs to support the Administration\u2019s goals to increase transit  State of Good Repair efforts, expand access through the Capital  Investment Grants program, and provide clean transportation alternatives through increased funding for zero-emission vehicles.   Federal Railroad Administration.  The Administration strongly supports the $4.1 billion provided in the bill for the Federal Railroad Administration programs to help spark the next rail revolution, including a new PRIME  grant program that would support the improvement, expansion, or  establishment of passenger rail service, continued support of Amtrak, and grants for safety and infrastructure improvements to passenger and freight rail.    National Infrastructure Investments.  The  Administration appreciates the $1.2 billion provided in the bill for the multi-modal Rebuilding American  Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity   grant program to support  infrastructure projects with a significant local or regional impact.     15 Thriving Communities.  The Administration appreciates the support the bill provides to the  Thriving Communities initiative, which would help communities remove obsolete transportation barriers, and increase  access to jobs, schools, and other key areas by better  linking transportation and land use decision-making.   Department of  Housing  and Urban Development (HUD)   Housing Choice Vouchers.  The Administration strongly supports the $29.2 billion provided in the bill for the Housing  Choice Voucher program.  The Administration appreciates the significant increase to expand housing vouchers to an additional 130,000 low-income  households, including  focusing on those who are homeless or fleeing from domestic violence.  The Administration also  appreciates the funding to provide mobility services to help families find housing in high-opportunity neighborhoods, and renew assistance  for all 2.3 million currently assisted households.   Public Housing Fund.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for, and significant investment in, the Nation\u2019s Public Housing stock by fully funding the  annual operating  needs for 900,000 assisted units, as well as providing $3.7 billion for capital needs  for modernization and addressing health hazards.  The Administration also appreciates the  $150 million for investments in energy efficiency  and climate resilience, supporting the  Administration\u2019s priority to tackle the climate crisis.    HOME Investment Partnerships Program.  The Administration strongly supports the $1.9 billion provided for HOME block grants to support critical investments in the supply  of  affordable  housing, including  a $50 million set-aside to expand sustainable homeownership among first-generation and/or low-wealth first-time homebuyers.   Homeless Assistance Grants.   The Administration appreciates the $3.4 billion provided for  Homeless Assistance Grants, which fund a variety  of intervention programs that serve homeless  and at-risk individuals and families, including survivors of domestic violence and homeless  youth.  This increase would provide assistance to nearly 55,000 additional  individuals  experiencing homelessness.   Salaries and Expenses  (S&E).  The Administration appreciates the $1.6 billion provided in the  bill for HUD S&E, but urges the Congress to fully  fund S&E at the $1.7 billion level requested in the FY 2022 Budget.  The requested level would enable HUD to properly  manage a  growing  portfolio of rental assistance, grants, and insured mortgages and deliver on key  Administration priorities, including rigorous enforcement of the  Fair Housing  Act.   Constitutional  Concerns   Certain provisions of the  draft bill raise separation of powers  concerns, including by conditioning  the Executive\u2019s authority to take certain actions on receiving the  approval  of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.  The Administration looks forward to working  with the Congress to address these and other  concerns.     16 The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the  FY 2022 appropriations  process moves forward.   * * * * * * *    17 ", " ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3110, the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) for Nursing Mothers Act.  No new mother should face unfair treatment in the workplace because  their  employer refuses to provide  them  with reasonable break time and  private, clean  space needed to adequately  express  breast milk  while at work, forcing  them  to choose between their  health and the health of her child, and earning a paycheck. Yet millions of new working  mothers, disproportionately working mothers of color, face this challenge  every day.  Congress recognized the importance of ensuring that workers are  able to have the time and space  they need to express breast milk by passing section 4207 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as the 2010 Break Time for Nursing Mothers Act.  The PUMP for Nursing  Mothers Act would ensure that millions of working mothers  previously  excluded from the 2010 Break Time law  are protected.  By  closing this gap, the PUMP for Nursing  Mothers Act will ensure  millions of nursing mothers have a  clear right to pump at work.  Without these  protections, nursing mothers face serious health consequences, including risk of painful illness and infection,  diminished milk supply, or inability  to continue breastfeeding.   H.R. 3110  is a bipartisan bill that would also require  employers to pay  an hourly employee for  any time spent pumping if the employee is also working.  The  legislation would ensure that nursing mothers have access to remedies available for other violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Finally, the  PUMP Act also gives employers flexibility to identify solutions that work for their specific business environment.  For example, the bill requires employees to inform their employers about inadequate space to express breast milk 10 days before  filing  suit for  violating the requirement. The Administration encourages the House to pass this bipartisan, commonsense legislation and looks forward to working with the Congress to  fill the gaps in the law so that all  new mothers  who  choose to breastfeed  are  guaranteed the workplace protections they deserve.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports H.R. 3233, a bill to establish a National Commission to investigate the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol Complex.  The attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on our democracy, an  effort to undo the will of the American people and threaten the peaceful transition of power.  While the Federal Government has already begun taking action to improve the safety and security of the U.S. Capitol, the Administration supports the proposed bipartisan, independent National Commission to  study and investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.  The Nation deserves such a full and fair accounting to prevent future violence and strengthen the security and resilience of our democratic institutions.   * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports enactment of a National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)  for a 61st consecutive  year and is grateful for the strong, bipartisan work this year by  the Senate Armed Services Committee on behalf of America\u2019s national defense.   The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress to set an appropriate and responsible level of defense spending to support the security of the  Nation.  At the same time, the Administration looks forward to working with Congress to provide appropriate resources for  non-security investments and security investments outside the Department of Defense (DOD).  A  strong economy is critical to ensuring that our Nation is positioned for strategic competition, and investments in diplomacy,  development, and economic statecraft enhance  the effectiveness of national defense spending and promote national security.  The Administration opposes the direction to add  funding for platforms and systems that cannot be affordably modernized given the need to eliminate wasteful spending  and  prioritize  survivable, and resilient forces that credibly deter advanced threats.   Our national security  interests require  forces that can fight across the spectrum of conflict.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address its concerns, a number of which are outlined below.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the classified annex to the committee report and working with Congress to address any  concerns about classified programs.  Optimizing Program Investments and Modernization.   The Administration strongly opposes restoration of funding to systems that limit DOD\u2019s ability to divest or retire  lower priority  platforms not relevant to tomorrow\u2019s battlefield.  The President\u2019s Budget divests or retires vulnerable and costly platforms that no longer meet mission or security needs, and reinvests those savings in transformational, innovative assets that match the dynamic threat landscape  and advance the capabilities of the force of the  future.  The Administration strongly opposes language that would limit decommissioning or inactivation of battle force ships before the end of  their expected service life (section 135)  and retiring A-10 aircraft (section 143). The  Administration also strongly opposes language that would establish minimum inventory  requirements of systems such as tactical airlift and fighter aircraft (sections 141 and 142) and 1   would authorize unrequested funding  for Expeditionary Fast Transport ships.  Such provisions would limit the  Department\u2019s flexibility to prioritize resource investment, delay modernization of  capabilities, and impede implementation of the  emergent  National Defense  Strategy.    Afghanistan Security Forces Fund.   Section 1213 provides authorities no longer needed following the collapse of the Afghan National Defense and Security  Forces (ANDSF).  Therefore, the Administration strongly urges the Senate to adopt  the  language in the  House bill to enable the responsible termination of the Afghanistan Security  Forces Fund (ASFF) by  authorizing the use of ASFF  for costs associated with the termination of support to the ANDSF.  The termination will involve, at a minimum, closing out several hundred contracts and, in many  cases, negotiating financial settlements with the contractors, developing  a full accounting  for all  ASFF-funded equipment and supplies that are outside Afghanistan, and assessing amounts and the use of appropriations for potential contract settlement costs and the cost of transporting and storing  ASFF-funded materiel for purposes of treating it as DOD stocks.  More analysis is necessary to develop prudent estimates of these  costs and of timelines for completing these  actions.   Recommendations of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military (IRC).   The Administration commends the determined and bipartisan effort reflected by the bill to advance the shared goal of Congress and the Administration to make real and sustainable progress on the prevention of  and response to sexual assault and other related crimes, and improve support for survivors.     The Administration supports effective implementation of the IRC\u2019s recommendations focused on accountability,  improving prevention, climate and culture, and victim care  and support and has developed  and instituted  a phased implementation plan to build the foundation and infrastructure  necessary to do so sustainably.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to clarify Sec. 530B, to allow for alignment with the Department of Defense\u2019s ongoing  implementation strategy. Additionally, some of the  IRC\u2019s recommendations  \u2013  such as 4.2 b, which relates to services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs \u2013  are beyond the  authority of the Secretary of Defense to implement  unilaterally.    The Administration is committed to executing military justice  reform, and welcomes efforts by  Congress to enact legislation that supports core aspects of the IRC\u2019s recommendations for  accountability, namely: that the decision to prosecute  special victim crimes (including, but not  limited to: sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence) be made by Special Victim Prosecutors (SVPs) within a fully professionalized  judge  advocate organization; that SVPs have  the requisite litigation experience and specialized training to be able to work with victims of these complex, interpersonal crimes; and that each Military Department  establish an Office of the  Special Victim Prosecutor (OSVP) that can operate with independence from the command  reporting structure  and under the direction of the Secretary of the Military  Department, without intervening  authority.  The  Administration believes that each Secretary of a Military Department  should have discretion to determine the director of the OSVP, who  may be  a Senior Executive  Service civilian, best suited to carry out the mission of the Office as determined by that Secretary.     2    To ensure effective reform, the Administration recommends the date prescribed by  section  552, so that adequate time is provided to issue necessary  implementing regulations, identify and hire  appropriately qualified personnel, train both new and existing personnel, and then place them in newly  created positions.   Additionally, effective  reform will require  an increase in the resources committed to the system.  Accordingly, the Administration objects to section 564, which would require implementation of the military justice reforms using otherwise-authorized personnel and resources.  The  Administration will work with Congress to determine the appropriate resource level needed to ensure effective implementation of the revised military justice system.    In addition to these recommendations from the  IRC, the Administration urges Congress to enable  military protective orders (MPOs) to be given full faith and credit, and enact legislation that would provide DOD  and the Services sufficient time to assess and implement this change.   Limitation on Modifications to Sexual Assault Reporting Procedures.   The Administration strongly objects to section 566, which would prohibit the Secretary of Defense from amending  section 4 of enclosure 4 of DOD  Instruction 6495.02, relating to Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures, \u201cor otherwise prescribe any  regulations or guidance relating to the treatment and handling of unrestricted and restricted reports of sexual assault, until 30 days after notifying the congressional defense  committees of the proposed amendment or  modification.\u201d  This provision  could delay potential needed updates to DOD\u2019s sexual assault  regulations.  The administration is committed to working with Congress in a transparent way on these important matters, but must maintain flexibility to amend internal policies when needed.   Air and Space National Guard.   The Administration does not oppose section 902, which would rename the  Air National Guard as the Air and Space National Guard.   This provision would avoid the significant administrative expenses associated with establishing  a stand-alone Space  National Guard, so DOD can prioritize the development of new space capabilities.   The  Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on alternative  Space Force  concepts that are efficient, effective, and appropriate for space missions.   DOD Contractor  Professional Training Material Disclosure Requirements.  The  Administration strongly  opposes section 818, which would require all DOD contractors to post  online or, if they lack an online presence, submit in paper to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment all diversity, equal opportunity, equity, inclusion, or  tolerance training materials or internal policies related to these subjects.   This provision would require the disclosure of intellectual property  and proprietary information.   Furthermore, the provision would be a barrier to entry, especially for small businesses or companies contracting  with the Department for the first time.  This provision, therefore, would limit the number of entities willing or able to do business with the Department at a time when access to talent, technology, and innovation is a critical determinant of the U.S.\u2019s ability to compete.   Limitations on Use of Funds in the National Defense Sealift (NDS) Fund.   The  Administration strongly  objects to the removal of  funding for used sealift vessels.   The  Administration also urges support for the necessary  relief to recapitalize the sealift fleet with 3    used vessels by removing existing statutory limitations.   The Administration strongly encourages Congress to remove the statutory cap on the number of used sealift vessels DOD can procure and to remove the statutory link between the use of NDS funding for the purchase of used vessels and the requirement to procure new construction vessels.  This will allow the Administration to recapitalize the sealift fleet, with all used ship conversions taking place  in U.S. shipyards, for a  fraction of the cost of procuring new vessels.   Basic Needs Allowance for Low-Income Regular Members.   The  Administration supports a  basic needs allowance.  The Administration needs a more comprehensive data analysis to determine the inclusion or exclusion of basic allowance  for housing  when considering the calculation of a basic needs allowance.  Using this analysis, the Administration would like to work with Congress to develop an appropriate calculation for targeting  recipients of a basic needs allowance.    Prohibition on Missile Defense Agency Production of Satellites and Ground  Systems Associated with Operation of  Such Satellites.   The Administration strongly objects to section 1510, which would prohibit the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) from authorizing or obligating  funding for a program of record for the production of satellites, with an associated limitation of funds. Hypersonic  and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) On-Orbit Prototype  Demonstration phase began in January 2021 with contracts awarded to two industry teams.  This program supports unique missile defense requirements to provide fire-control quality tracking  data on hypersonic  and ballistic missile threats for engagement by missile defense  weapons, and is a critical element of the Missile Defense System kill-chain.  Enacting section 1510 would delay delivery of this capability to the warfighter.  Also, consistent with congressional direction, the Secretary of Defense  has certified the Director  of  MDA as the responsible agent for  developing the HBTSS capability.   Modification of United  States-Israel Operations-Technology Cooperation within the United  States-Israel Defense Acquisition Advisory Group.   While the Administration strongly  supports strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship, the Administration strongly opposes section 1271, which would make the United States-Israel Operations-Technology  Working Group (OTWG) mandatory.  DOD has developed draft Terms of  Reference for such a  group and is finalizing negotiations with Israel.  However, enactment of section 1271 would eliminate the flexibility the Administration needs to ensure that the terms, membership, and focus of the  OTWG are in the U.S. interest.   Enhancement of Recusal for Conflicts of Personal Interest Requirements for Department of Defense Officers and  Employees.   The Administration is committed to preventing conflicts of interest, but is concerned that section 1103 lacks any mechanism for the  Secretary of Defense  to grant a waiver or authorization  to authorize participation when it is in the best interests of the  Government.   Section 1103 needs to be aligned with existing ethics rules because it introduces new terms, broader standards, and requires the  Department to further screen all DOD personnel from participating in \u201ccovered matters\u201d involving  clients and competitors of an employee\u2019s former employer for four  years.  Section 1103 would significantly extend the time and resources needed to make decisions and limit DOD\u2019s ability to hire qualified personnel.   4    Missile Defense Radar in Hawaii.   The Administration opposes added funding for the  Homeland Defense Radar \u2013  Hawaii (HDR-H).  The Department had planned to field HDR-H, the  Pacific Radar, the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), and the Long Range Discrimination Radar by  the mid-2020s as a system of systems to improve  homeland ballistic missile defense.  The Pacific  Radar has been delayed indefinitely due to stalled negotiations with the host nation, and the RKV  program has been cancelled.  Hawaii is currently defended against missile threats to  the same extent as the rest of the United States, and DOD is currently investing in other capabilities, such as the Next Generation Interceptor, which will support the long-term defense of Hawaii.   Reprioritization of Military Construction  Funding to Unrequested Projects.   The  Administration opposes section 4601, which would realign military  construction funding  authorization from priority  projects to other projects not included in the President\u2019s Budget.  Contrary to the  Administration\u2019s fiscally  responsible policy to fully fund projects, the bill proposes to fund 14 military construction projects incrementally, effectively  creating an unfunded obligation of almost $1 billion to complete these projects.   Alignment of Close Combat Lethality Task Force.  The Administration strongly opposes section 905, which would prevent implementation of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s decision to realign the Close Combat Lethality Task Force (CCLTF) to the Secretary of the Army, effective  October 1, 2021.  Section 905 would prevent the alignment of the CCLTF  with the organization best positioned to identify, test, develop, demonstrate, and integrate new close combat capabilities, capacity that is already built into the Army\u2019s Maneuver Center of Excellence.  Importantly, the CCLTF  will remain a joint organization, with a Tri-Service board governing the work of the CCLTF.   Prohibition on Support for Offensive Military Operations Against the Houthis in Yemen.   The Administration opposes section 1272 because  it is unnecessary; the Administration already  has ceased support for Saudi-led coalition offensive operations in Yemen.  In addition, because  DOD does not have the lead for humanitarian aid delivery, the Secretary of Defense is not the  appropriate official to provide the requested report.   Prohibition on Reduction of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles of the United States.   The  Administration objects to section 1543, which would restrict the President and the Department of Defense from reducing the number of deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles below 400.  The Administration objects to this restriction while the force structure is under review as part of  the ongoing Nuclear Posture Review (NPR).  This language would constrain the President\u2019s ability to propose the nuclear force he determines is necessary.   Significant New Foreign Policy Provisions.   The Administration is concerned that the bill  includes certain sections\u2014specifically 1011, 1201, 1205, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1211, 1242, and 1275\u2014that would require DOD engagement in, analysis of, or reporting on significant foreign policy issues without including sufficient means for the Secretary of State to provide input and ensure that foreign assistance is carried out in a manner consistent with foreign policy priorities.     5    Coordination Between  United States Cyber Command and Private Sector.   The  Administration opposes section 1604, as this provision\u2019s relationship to section 1642(b) of the FY 2019 NDAA is unclear. The Secretary of Defense\u2019s authority to \u201cmake  arrangements with private sector entities, on a voluntary basis\u201d under section 1642(b) is scoped to the four top nation-state threats.  In contrast, section 1604 is not similarly scoped, is not tied to existing  authorities, is arguably duplicative, lacks appropriate coordination with the  Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, and may  prohibit internal U.S Government information sharing.   Pilot Program on  Public-Private  Partnerships with Internet Ecosystem  Companies to Detect and Disrupt Adversary Cyber Operations.   The Administration opposes section 1605, which would require the Secretary of Defense to initiate a pilot program to use public-private partnerships to facilitate detection and disruption of malicious cyber activity  on private sector infrastructure.  Many of the authorized activities would be achieved more  effectively through existing federal activities, such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s Joint  Cyber Defense Collaborative and several Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law  enforcement programs. Establishing a separate pilot program led by  DOD would further complicate federal efforts to collaborate with the private sector, including  \u201cinternet ecosystem companies,\u201d in a unified, coordinated manner.   Safe Drinking Water Act Amendment on Cybersecurity.   The Administration urges support for the requested amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act to enhance cybersecurity  and resilience requirements for drinking water systems.  Recent incidents show that cyber-attacks and malicious cyber activity against drinking water systems can disrupt and endanger our critical water infrastructure\u2019s ability to provide safe and reliable drinking  water, and put the health and lives of our citizens at risk.    Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility.   The Administration strongly objects to sections 1031, 1032, and 1033, which  would  extend the prohibitions on the use of funds to: transfer Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility (GTMO) detainees to the United States (1031);  construct or modify facilities in the United States to house transferred GTMO detainees (1032);  and transfer GTMO detainees to certain countries (1033).  These provisions  would  interfere  with the  President\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate disposition of GTMO detainees and to make  important foreign policy  and national security determinations regarding  whether and under what circumstances to transfer detainees to the custody  or effective control of foreign countries.   Constitutional Concerns.   Certain provisions of the bill, such as section 1232, raise constitutional concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address this and other constitutional concerns.   * * * * * * *    6    ", "The Administration supports House passage of the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (POWADA).  The bipartisan legislation would restore legal protections for older Americans and hold employers accountable for age discrimination.  The bill amends the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, to replace the \u201cbut-for\u201d test established in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. with the \u201cmotivating factor\u201d test.  The bill thereby aligns the burden of proof for age discrimination with similar standards for proving discrimination based on race and national origin.  In addition, the bill allows individuals claiming discrimination to rely on any type or form of admissible evidence to prove an unlawful practice occurred.   Workplace discrimination prevents people from fully accessing the American dream and limits the contributions that they can make to our shared prosperity.  Ending it is a priority for the Administration.

In May, the President put forward a  budget  proposal  for  FY 2022  that detailed his vision for  investing in American workers and families, enhancing  American  national  security, and advancing American leadership abroad.   Since then, both the House and Senate majorities have  put forward appropriations bills that further these  goals.  The Administration urges the Congress  to use the coming weeks  to engage in robust bipartisan negotiations to reach  agreement on  appropriations  and avoid the devastating effects of a full-year continuing  resolution.   Full-year  appropriations bills are  critical for a wide range of bipartisan priorities\u2014from defense readiness  and modernization, to research and development, to veteran benefits  programs.   The Administration  appreciates  the $7  billion provided in H.R. 6119  to continue the  interagency  efforts  in support of Operation Allies Welcome.   This is a cause that has widespread bipartisan  support in the  Congress  and with Americans who are working in their  communities to help resettle America\u2019s  allies and those at risk.  The additional funding is critical to  ensuring  that the United States,  having  responsibly  ended  U.S. involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan, can continue  to  resettle Afghan  partners  and provide  them with  essential services.

This bipartisan, bicameral legislation empowers survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment by  giving them a choice to go to court instead of being  forced into arbitration. Under current law, many employment and other contracts require binding  arbitration for a wide  range of matters  before  a dispute arises,  which denies survivors the ability  to decide whether to pursue their claim with the procedural protections provided by  courts, and silences  victims of abuse by forcing them into a confidential dispute forum  without the right to appeal.  More than 60 million Americans are subject  to mandatory arbitration clauses in the workplace, often without  realizing it  until they  come forward to bring a  claim against their employer.   The  Report of the Co-Chairs of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s Select Task Force  on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace  notes  that between 50-75  percent  of women have  faced some form of unwanted or unwelcome sexual harassment in the workplace.  Additionally, contracts for services may  include mandatory arbitration clauses in the fine print that shield companies and businesses from being held publicly  accountable for the harm caused. This legislation would  amend the Federal Arbitration Act for disputes involving sexual assault  and sexual harassment in order to stop employers  and businesses from forcing employees and customers  out of the court system and into arbitration.  It would ensure that predispute arbitration clauses and  waivers of the right to bring joint actions in cases of sexual assault or sexual harassment would not be  valid or enforceable for  cases that are filed under Federal, Tribal, or State law.  This legislation advances efforts to prevent and address sexual harassment and sexual assault, strengthen  rights, protect victims, and promote  access to justice.  The Administration is committed to  eliminating  sexual harassment and assault, and looks forward to working with the  Congress on the Ending  Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act as it proceeds through the legislative process.  The  Administration also looks forward to working  with the Congress on broader legislation that addresses these issues as well as other forced arbitration  matters, including  arbitration of claims regarding  discrimination on the basis of race, wage theft, and unfair labor practices.      *******   ", "The Administration strongly opposes S.J.  Res.  46, a joint resolution that  would disapprove the rule submitted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) relating to \u201cProcedures for Credible Fear Screening  and Consideration of Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and CAT Protection Claims by Asylum Officers.\u201d  Since Day One, the Biden Administration has been committed to building a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system.   A particular focus of that effort has been on improving the asylum  system, which the previous Administration decimated, resulting in record-high backlogs and unprecedented delays for asylum seekers.  On  March 29, 2022, DHS and DOJ issued an  interim final  rule  (IFR)  that will significantly  accelerate and improve  the  processing of asylum claims made by noncitizens encountered at the  border.  Through swift processing, this rule  will  ensure  that those who are eligible for  asylum  are  granted relief quickly, and  that  those who are not are promptly removed.   The rule allows U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)  Asylum Officers  to consider the claims of individuals subject to expedited removal who assert a fear of  persecution or torture  and pass the required credible fear screening  process.   Currently, individuals who establish a  credible fear of persecution or torture are referred to  immigration judges within DOJ\u2019s Executive  Office  for  Immigration Review.   Due to existing backlogs\u2014which doubled in size under the  prior administration\u2014it takes several years on average for an immigration judge to hear and decide these  asylum  claims.  This rule aims to reduce the  time it takes for  asylum claims covered by the  rule  to be decided to  less than a  year.   When fully  implemented, the reforms and efficiencies provided by the  rule will  result in a process that takes several months for most asylum applicants.   This rule advances the Administration\u2019s efforts to ensure that asylum claims are processed fairly  and  expeditiously, so that those with valid claims can stay, and those without valid claims to remain in the United States can be removed quickly.   It will help reduce the burden on immigration courts, protect those fleeing persecution and torture, and enable immigration  judges to issue removal orders on a  faster timeline when appropriate.   This IFR was promulgated in accordance  with the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s notice  and comment rulemaking  requirements.   The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was issued by  DHS and DOJ in August 2021.   The Departments carefully  reviewed more  than 5,000 public comments received in response to the NPRM.   The  IFR  generally adopts the framework proposed in the NPRM, with several adjustments recommended or prompted by  commenters.  Further, the Departments  have  solicited additional comments  on the  IFR  to allow for continued public  engagement and input on the process.    If Congress were to pass S.J.

America was not  built by Wall Street.   It was built by the middle class, and unions built the  middle class.  Unions put power in the hands of workers.  They  give workers  a stronger voice to increase  wages, improve  the quality of jobs and protect job security, protect against racial  and all other forms of discrimination and sexual harassment, and protect workers\u2019  health, safety, and benefits in the workplace.  Unions lift up workers, both union and non-union.  The policy of the United  States  Government, stated clearly in the National Labor Relations Act, is to encourage union organizing and collective bargaining.  However, due to anti-union efforts  by many employers for decades, lax enforcement of existing labor laws, and the failure to restore and strengthen labor laws to address the real-world of labor-management relations, only 6.3%  percent of  private-sector  U.S. wage and salary  workers  were union members in 2020.  H.R. 842 would strengthen and protect  workers\u2019 right to form a union by allowing the National Labor  Relations  Board (NLRB) to assess penalties on employers who violate workers\u2019 right to organize and ensuring  that  workers  who suffer retaliation for exercising these rights  receive  immediate relief.    The PRO Act  also defends  workers\u2019 right to strike\u2014a fundamental economic right\u2014and to engage in boycotts and other acts of solidarity with workers  at other companies  without penalty.  It clarifies that employers may not force  employees to waive their  rights  to join together  in collective or class action  litigation.   The bill also closes loopholes in Federal labor law by barring  employers from misclassifying workers as independent contractors and preventing  workers from  being denied remedies due to their immigration status.   It establishes an expansive  joint employer standard,  allowing workers to collectively  bargain with all the companies that control the terms and  conditions of their employment.  The bill allows unions to collect fair-share fees to  cover the  cost of  collective bargaining and administering  a union contract  for all workers  who are protected by the contract\u2019s terms.  H.R. 842 restores workers\u2019 access to fair union elections  and ensures the results are respected.   The Administration  strongly encourages the House to pass H.R. 842, and looks forward to working  with the Congress to enact  this critical legislation that safeguards  workers\u2019  rights to organize and bargain collectively.

This proposed FMS case would replenish Saudi Arabia\u2019s existing inventory of air-to-air missiles.   These missiles are not used to engage  ground targets; Saudi Arabia uses these munitions to defend against  aerial cross-border attacks,  such as Houthi explosive-laden drones.

The legislation was introduced after the previous  Administration issued the discriminatory  Muslim ban, resulting  in hundreds of people being detained in airports without the opportunity to call  or consult with  an attorney, advocate, or  even a relative or family member.  The bill would affirm that individuals detained by immigration officials in airports, at the border, and under other specific  circumstances have the right to access legal advice, either in person or remotely.  The Access to Counsel Act will ensure that individuals with valid travel documents who present themselves at the border or airports can communicate with an attorney or advocate. The Administration recognizes the importance of legitimate travel and trade through the Nation\u2019s ports of entry, and looks  forward to working with the Congress to ensure that this bill can be  operationalized.  Beyond the passage of H.R.  1573, the Administration also urges the Congress to reform other aspects of our immigration system by passing the U.S. Citizenship Act, which  would provide a  path to citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants, establish a  new system to responsibly manage and secure our border, bring long overdue visa reforms to keep families together and grow our economy, and address the  root causes of instability  and unsafe conditions causing migration from Central America.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration expresses its  deep  gratitude and admiration for America\u2019s firefighters, who brave extraordinarily  challenging conditions and dangers to protect our communities, property, and natural resources from increasingly intense and frequent fires.  In recognition of their  courage  and the strong evidence of the physical toll that their service has  on their health, the  Administration supports passage of  H.R. 2499, the Federal  Firefighters Fairness Act of 2022.  When a federal employee sustains a work-related injury or disease, the Federal Employees\u2019  Compensation Act provides monetary support, medical benefits, and other  assistance to  help  the employee recover and return to work.  The program also provides benefits  to dependents if a  work-related injury or disease causes death.  H.R. 2499 would support federal firefighters by  facilitating easier  access to  critical  resources  that will help them and their families recover from the  trauma and physical harms brought on by their  hazardous line of work.  Specifically, the bill lists  health  conditions, such as  several forms of cancer or  a heart attack or stroke that occurs shortly  after battling a fire, that are  deemed to be  caused by  a firefighter\u2019s  employment.  The bill also includes a process for  expanding  the list as  new diseases  are identified and linked to firefighting  based on scientific evidence.  The President  has prioritized addressing the harmful health effects of environmental exposures, particularly among our nation\u2019s veterans.  This bill is consistent with the Administration\u2019s  support for expanding  access to benefits and services for those harmed by  hazards  faced in the line of duty.  Additionally, as part of his broader health agenda, the President remains committed to ending  cancer as we know it.  This includes significant investments in biomedicine and reigniting the  cancer  moonshot initiative  with a  goal of reducing  the cancer death rate by  at least 50 percent  over the next 25 years.  Record-setting temperatures, long-term drought, and volatile weather patterns, exacerbated by  climate change, have increased the risks and stress for America\u2019s 15,000 federal firefighters.

Aggressive  efforts to analyze the impact of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\u201cPFAS\u201d)  on  human health and the environment are necessary  to meet the  challenges associated with developing regulations to reduce  exposure to these  substances and improve  public health.  The Administration is pressing  forward with targeted actions in its regulatory agenda to achieve this goal, and  looks forward to working  with the sponsors  on this critical issue.  Addressing these \u201cforever chemicals\u201d remains one of the most complex environmental challenges of our day due to the number of chemicals, the impacts on human  health, and the  widespread use of PFAS  and their  ubiquity in the  environment.  PFAS are  widely used for their  resistance to grease, water, oil, and heat.  They  are most well-known for their applications in stain-resistant carpeting, water-resistant clothing, flame-retardant textiles and furniture, non-stick and grease-resistant  food contact materials (e.g.,  cookware  and fast food packaging), and firefighting  foam.  PFAS do not break down easily  in the environment or the human body due to the strong  carbon-fluorine bond. Certain PFAS have been found to be associated with  adverse  human health impacts.  The science surrounding these chemicals continues to evolve at a rapid pace  and this Administration is working closely with our state,  local, and Tribal  partners  to  take  the appropriate actions necessary to phase out the chemicals that are found to be toxic to human health and the environment  and to  continue to  develop safe  alternatives for use in life-safety  applications like firefighting.  This Administration is committed to keeping pace  with the best available science to protect public health.  We  have taken down the politically compromised toxicity assessment  for  perfluorobutane sulfonic  acid (PFBS)  and provided an update that upholds the tenets of scientific  integrity and can be  relied upon for further regulatory  action.  We are moving forward with drafting a proposed  national primary drinking water standard for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and studying the presence and impact of 29 other  priority PFAS in our drinking water.  We continue to evaluate the appropriateness of identifying  certain PFAS as hazardous substances  under the nation\u2019s Superfund law\u2014the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act\u2014and continue  to assess the impacts of exposure to these chemicals from common consumer products  and search for alternatives to these substances in fire-fighting foam and equipment.   H.R. 2467 supports many of the scientific and regulatory actions that are already underway and demonstrates the commitment across the branches of government to take on this challenge.  We support the intent of the PFAS Action Act to address PFAS across media.

FVPSA also provides funding for  a network of state and territorial domestic violence coalitions, the  National Domestic  Violence  Hotline,  and national technical assistance  providers that  provide  training and capacity building to ensure  that vital services and support are available to individuals experiencing  domestic violence  and their children.   Additionally,  FVPSA funds the  DELTA program,  which provides funds to design, implement, and evaluate innovative domestic  violence and dating violence prevention models.  As a result of  FVPSA  funding, each year approximately 1.3 million survivors receive critical services such as emergency shelter, crisis counseling, safety planning, assistance in seeking  an order of protection, and assistance recovering from financial abuse  and addressing housing  insecurity.  Nonetheless, research demonstrates that  the need for services continues to outpace  availability and  many survivors are unable to access critical services and support.  Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated economic insecurity, increased isolation, and compounded barriers faced by victims and survivors in seeking safety  and stability, particularly  for those from historically  marginalized communities.  H.R. 2119 is a bipartisan bill that will authorize increased funding to strengthen existing services while expanding access to tribes  and tribal coalitions, culturally-specific programs, and other underserved communities.

The legislation would reauthorize and expand the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science, supporting  the construction and upgrade of world-leading  facilities,  advancing  research in the sectors of the future,  advancing  technology to combat the climate crisis, and enhancing the Nation\u2019s ability to respond to future pandemics.  H.R. 4521  would also reauthorize and expand the National Science Foundation.  The legislation would lower barriers to inclusion and broaden opportunities for  people and communities who have historically been underserved and underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.   H.R.  4521 would also authorize  investments  in regional economic  revitalization and growth through the creation of regional technology and innovation hubs to ensure  that our innovation ecosystem benefits communities across the country  and supports  broad-based, inclusive prosperity.  The legislation would complement the President\u2019s efforts to strengthen critical domestic supply  chains.  It would establish  a new office  at the Department of Commerce to monitor, analyze, and support the resilience of our supply chains  and domestic manufacturing, including through authorization of new grants, loans, and loan guarantees.  It would further support domestic  manufacturing through expansion of the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program and Manufacturing  USA Institutes.   H.R. 4521 would also incentivize  investments in domestic  semiconductor manufacturing,  building  on the President\u2019s goals of regaining world leadership in semiconductor production and mitigating future disruptions and shortages that threaten American economic security  and jobs.     The legislation would also authorize important workforce programs, including for registered apprenticeships, and it would reauthorize  the  Trade Adjustment Assistance  program, which reverted to more restrictive eligibility  criteria in July 2021 and will terminate on July 1, 2022, without new legislation.   The Administration supports these steps to strengthen our economic  competitiveness, supply  chain resilience, equity and inclusivity, and leadership in science and technology.  We look forward to working with the House and the Senate to pass comprehensive competitiveness legislation that will make these long-overdue and necessary investments.   * * * * * * *    ", "The Administration strongly  opposes Senate passage of S.  3436, imposing further  mandatory  sanctions  requirements  with respect to entities responsible for the planning, construction, or  operation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  The Administration has been clear with our  allies that Nord Stream 2 is a harmful Russian geopolitical project that is a bad deal for Ukraine and a bad deal for Europe.   The Administration does not believe this bill is a genuine effort to counter  Russian aggression or protect Ukraine.   In fact, if passed, the legislation would  only serve  to undermine unity  amongst our European  allies at a crucial moment when we need to present a unified front  in response to Russian threats against Ukraine.  The Administration strongly believes any new  sanctions  authority  should  allow us to impose maximal costs  on Russia if  it  further invades  Ukraine, in a manner that would preserve  Transatlantic unity, which this legislation does not do.   The Administration remains focused on working  with Germany to implement the  July 21  Joint  Statement of the United States and Germany on Support for Ukraine, Energy Security, and Our  Climate Goals, which includes clear commitments to act  if Russia attempts  to  use  energy  as  a  weapon  or  commits  further  aggressive  acts  against  Ukraine, and which the recently elected German government continue to implement.   Additionally,  the  Administration  continues  to  implement  the  Protecting  Europe\u2019s  Energy  Security  Act,  as  amended.   The  Administration\u2019s  ability  to  issue  a  waiver  of  sanctions  as provided by current law, facilitates  continued  U.S. engagement  with  Germany  on  the  full  implementation  of  these  commitments.  It is therefore imperative that flexible waiver  authority for such existing or new sanctions always be preserved,  without adding conditions that undermine the waiver\u2019s effectiveness, including the protracted review and expedited override procedures proposed in the current bill.  It is our assessment that the congressional review  mechanisms established in S. 3436 would open the door to further  unintended consequences that may take valuable floor time away from the Senate to consider additional measures.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports House  passage of the Protect Older Job Applicants (POJA)  Act of 2021.  The legislation would amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)  of 1967,  which prohibits, among other  actions,  age-based discrimination in hiring, to specifically  prohibit employers from limiting, segregating, or classifying job applicants on the basis of age.  The POJA Act of 2021 provides  a critical clarification to  support older Americans during  recruitment and  hiring, ensuring  the ADEA\u2019s nondiscrimination protections extend fully  to older job applicants.  Workplace  age  discrimination, including at the application stage,  prevents people from fully  accessing the American dream and limits the contributions that they can make to our shared prosperity.  Ensuring equitable access to employment  is a priority  for the Administration.

This legislation would require  important changes to the manner in which publicly traded companies account for and disclose certain activities and risks, including disclosures promoting  greater equity, transparency, and enhanced investor protections.  As our Nation  builds a more equitable economic future, these measures will help safeguard the  financial security of America\u2019s families, businesses, and workers from risks including the climate-related financial risks they  already  face.  These measures will help protect workers\u2019  hard-earned savings.  H.R. 1187 would require  the disclosure of environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics, empowering shareholders with information regarding the connections between an issuer\u2019s ESG metrics and long-term business strategy.  The bill would require the establishment of  the  Sustainable Finance  Advisory Committee to identify measures the SEC can take to facilitate more sustainable investments.   The bill would require additional disclosures around companies\u2019 pay  equity, political expenditures, and tax liabilities relative to their profit.  H.R.  1187 includes important reporting  requirements for financial and business risks associated with climate change, reflecting the urgent need to account for the quantitative and qualitative costs of climate risk in a uniform, industry-specific manner.  The Administration supports efforts to account for climate risk  in financial services, empower and protect investors, and promote transparency, accountability  and equity in corporate governance.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration applauds the  Senate sponsors\u2019 preparation of  a bill that reflects feedback from state and local election officials and  enjoys  a broad base of bipartisan support from the American people.

The  United States Postal Service  and its dedicated employees  provide an  essential  public  service  and the critical public  infrastructure for the delivery of mail  and packages  to  all  Americans  in  every corner of the  country.   The  Postal Service provides  crucial  support to millions of Americans, including  our Nation\u2019s veterans, including  by  ensuring their ability to vote  and  providing  access to prescription medications.  Furthermore, the Postal Service is an indispensable complement to and  foundational support for American businesses and communities.    The Administration supports efforts to strengthen the United States Postal Service,  including by  providing Postal employees with the dignity, fair pay, and employer-provided benefits they have  earned.   The Administration is committed to ensuring that the  Postal Service delivers the highest  quality, most reliable service possible to every American.   This  legislation would advance these  goals in several ways.  Under current law, the Postal Service is required to annually prepay future retirement health benefits, a requirement not imposed on most other public or private entities.  Consistent with the  President\u2019s longstanding commitment, H.R. 3076 would repeal this requirement, which unfairly and unnecessarily burdens the Postal Service.  H.R. 3076 would also  establish a  new, separate  Postal Service Health Benefits Program (PSHBP) within  the  existing  Federal Employees  Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), that  integrates  Postal  employees and annuitants into Medicare.   Making these changes  would  improve the Postal  Service\u2019s long-run financial outlook, without sacrificing quality, affordable health coverage  for Postal  employees  and retirees.   The Administration is  mindful  that these reforms would  impose  administrative burdens  on the Office of Personnel Management  and FEHBP,  and  further,  that  there  could be  potential challenges  with operationalizing Medicare integration  and with ensuring  ongoing funding to support administration of  the new PSHPB.   The Administration looks  forward to working with Congress to ensure that the goals of H.R. 3076 are met in an  efficient, equitable,  and cost-effective manner, while  safeguarding  the  continued stability of the FEHBP.   Finally, H.R. 3076 would  establish  new transparency and reporting requirements for the Postal  Service and its regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission; require the Postal Service to provide semi-annual reports to Congress on the implementation of its strategic plan; provide for a public dashboard using nationwide delivery metrics to track delivery performance; and mandate  a review of the  costing of competitive and non-competitive products.   The  Administration supports these efforts to improve accountability, reliability and transparency at  the Postal Service.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1629, the  Fairness in Orphan Drug  Exclusivity Act.  Orphan drug status is  intended to encourage  companies to  develop  promising  drugs for rare diseases.   Current law provides market exclusivity  for drugs that treat any disease  or condition which (A)  affects fewer  than 200,000 persons in the United States, or (B) affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the  cost of developing and making  available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from that drug\u2019s sales in the United States.   H.R. 1629 affects only drugs that qualify under the latter provision.  Current law allows market exclusivity to be extended for a  new version of the same drug  without the drug developer having to show a lack of profitability  for that new version as well.   This  legislation would close that loophole, requiring all drugs that obtain seven years of market  exclusivity  for conditions affecting 200,000 or more people to illustrate that they have no reasonable expectation of recovering R&D costs through U.S. sales.  The Administration applauds these steps to ensure Americans have  access to high quality, affordable treatments.  ** * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of Senate Joint Resolution 13 to nullify the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission\u2019s (EEOC) recently promulgated \u201cUpdate of  Commission\u2019s Conciliation Procedures,\u201d which became effective on February 16, 2021, under the Congressional Review Act.

Res. 13 would nullify  imposed  onerous  and rigid  new  procedures  on  the EEOC\u2019s obligation to conciliate or \u201csettle\u201d meritorious claims of employment discrimination, that risks  unduly  delaying and diverting limited resources from agency  efforts  to investigate and resolve  meritorious claims of employment discrimination.  The  rule increases the risk of retaliation  by making it easier for  employers to demand the identities of  those with information about unlawful discrimination, which will likely have a chilling  effect on the willingness of victims and witnesses to come  forward.   S.J. Res. 13 would nullify the rule\u2019s unnecessary and burdensome standards that would likely result in increased charge backlogs, and lengthier charge investigation, resolution and litigation times.  The resolution will also ensure  that EEOC has the flexibility to tailor settlements to the facts and circumstances of each case, thus increasing the  likelihood of  voluntary compliance.

This legislation would expressly  authorize  the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  to seek permanent injunctions and pursue equitable relief for all violations of law enforced by the  Commission.  One core mandate of the  FTC is to protect consumers from fraud and deception in the  marketplace.  Accordingly, H.R. 2668 would clarify the Commission\u2019s range of tools to provide relief to consumers and put a stop to  unlawful business practices.  The legislation amends the  Federal Trade Commission Act to provide the  FTC  with explicit authority  to require bad actors to return money earned through illegal activity  and to seek both injunctive and monetary relief for consumers in Federal courts.   The Administration applauds this step to expressly  authorize  the FTC  to seek permanent injunctions and pursue equitable relief for all violations of law enforced by the Commission and ensure that the cost of  illegal  practices falls on bad actors, not consumers targeted by illegal scams.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration  supports H.R. 3985, the Averting  Loss of Life and Injury by Expediting  SIVs Act of 2021.  This legislation supports the President\u2019s goal of ensuring  the United States meets our commitments to those who served with us in Afghanistan  and we continue to study  other features being proposed concerning potential scope of eligibility.  The  Afghan SIV Program was created in 2009 to provide safety  for Afghan interpreters, contractors, and security  personnel who worked for or on behalf of  the U.S. government in Afghanistan.   Since the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009 was originally  passed,  the United States has brought in thousands  of Afghans and their families to start new lives in the United States  free  from fear of Taliban retribution.  However, the current security situation in Afghanistan  presents a serious threat to these partners and we must be able to do more  to get them to safety.    H.R. 3985 will assist in our efforts to streamline the application process by removing  or revising  some  statutory  requirements the Administration has found to be unnecessary  and burdensome, while maintaining appropriate security vetting, and by increasing the total number of visas available to help meet the demand.  These changes to the program, along with those  in the  recently passed  H.R. 3385  HOPE  for SIVs  Act,  which will temporarily  waive the requirement for SIV applicants to undergo a medical examination while in Afghanistan  are critical to expediting the application process and helping us get more Afghan  partners  through the process and into safety.  The Administration understands that many Members  of Congress  and their constituents  have  served alongside the men and women whom  we  are trying to help through the SIV program.  We  are  grateful to  them as well as to all of the U.S. military and civilian personnel, serving alongside our Allies and partners, for  their  service  and dedication to the mission.  The  Administration looks  forward to working with Congress on this bill  to ensure we  are honoring our promises to those  who stood with us at great risk to their personal lives and those of their families, and to whom we  are indebted.  *******   ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1620, the Violence Against  Women Reauthorization Act of 2021.  The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) is a landmark piece of bipartisan legislation that was first enacted in 1994 and that was reauthorized in 2000, 2005, and 2013.  VAWA has transformed the Nation's  response to violence against  women and has brought  critically needed resources to States, Territories,  Tribes, and local  communities to help prevent and improve the response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.  Strengthening  and renewing VAWA, however, is long overdue.  As  many  as 1 in 3 women are subjected to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking at some point in their lives, and the rate is even higher  for women of color, lesbian and bisexual  women, and transgender people.  VAWA reauthorization is more urgent now than ever, especially when the pandemic and economic crisis have only further increased the risks of abuse  and the barriers to safety  for women in the United States.   The Administration is pleased that H.R. 1620 continues to build upon previous VAWA  authorizations, and includes new provisions to enhance  efforts  and address identified gaps and barriers.   H.R. 1620 would authorize funding for VAWA grant programs for fiscal  years 2022 through 2026 and would continue to invest in, and expand, strategies that advance access to  safety, justice, and economic stability  for victims and survivors.  The bill would maintain  established and effective  protections and programs, while also addressing persistent gaps through more holistic approaches in  order to address the complex realities and intersecting issues that impact survivors\u2019 lives.  H.R. 1620 would reauthorize grant programs that support the development  of a coordinated community response to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking.  It would expand the categories  for which funds may be used in various grant programs to provide  additional pathways to safety  and support for survivors.  Further, the bill seeks to reduce intimate  partner homicides  committed with  firearms  by expanding protections for victims and enhancing  support for law enforcement agencies and courts to improve the enforcement of court orders.  The bill would also improve the health care system\u2019s response to domestic violence, sexual  assault, dating violence, and stalking.  Domestic violence is  a leading  cause of homelessness for women and their children.  Without the  ability to access affordable housing, a victim must often times choose between becoming  homeless or remaining in an abusive situation.  H.R. 1620 includes provisions that would  provide  important housing protections  to  allow survivors in federally  assisted housing to relocate  to safe housing with victim relocation vouchers, maintain their housing  after a perpetrator leaves, or terminate a lease  early.   The bill also  would expand economic security protections for  survivors.     H.R. 1620 would  authorize  increased  funding to enhance  culturally specific services for victims. This would include developing  culturally-relevant training  and education programs  for  health care professionals  that are  designed to be inclusive of the experiences of  all individuals,  including  people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.  It would also include  training  on equity and anti-racism approaches to health  services delivery,  disparities in access to health  care services  and prevention resources, and current and historic systemic racism in health care services.   The Rape Prevention &  Education (RPE) formula grants, administered by the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, authorize  essential funding to States and  Territories to support  rape prevention and education programs conducted by rape crisis centers, sexual assault  coalitions, and other public and private nonprofit entities.  H.R. 1620 would  authorize higher levels of  funding  for prevention through  the RPE program  grants,  as well as  grant programs  focused on prevention efforts with youth administered through the  Department of Justice.  It also  would expand grants to support implementation of training programs to improve the capacity of  early childhood programs to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,  and stalking among the families they serve.   H.R. 1620 would also support institutions of higher  education in developing  and disseminating comprehensive prevention education for all students  and expanding training for school-based personnel and campus health centers to meet the needs  of  young victims of sexual violence.   The Administration strongly supports measures in H.R.  1620 that would  expand access to justice for Native American victims.   Native women are victimized at rates higher than any other  population in the United States, and the vast majority of Native victims report being victimized  by a non-native individual.   This bill would build  on the effectiveness of special criminal  jurisdiction for domestic violence cases that was included in prior VAWA  reauthorization laws  and address other significant co-occurring crimes.   It recognizes tribal jurisdiction that will allow participating  Tribes to hold  accountable  non-native perpetrators of sexual  violence, sex  trafficking, domestic violence  against child victims, stalking, elder  abuse, and assault against law  enforcement officers when they  commit  such crimes on  tribal territory.   The Administration is pleased that H.R. 1620 recognizes the need to provide protection and services to all victims of  abuse and includes proposals to strengthen  existing policies that were  supported by both Democrats and Republicans last  year.  The  Administration urges swift passage  of this legislation.    * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration calls  for  restoring balance to the management of our public lands and waters, creating jobs, confronting  the ongoing decline of  nature, and aligning  the management of  America\u2019s public lands and waters with our nation\u2019s climate, conservation, and clean energy  goals.  Because this legislation furthers those  goals, the Administration strongly supports House  passage of  H.R. 803. H.R. 803 combines  eight  separate measures that, among other things, permanently protect public  lands and waters in Colorado, California, and Washington by designating approximately 1.5 million acres of wilderness and incorporating more than 1,000 river miles into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.  It contains provisions to create  and maintain additional recreational  access by  authorizing new trails, services,  and facilities.    The legislation contains provisions that protect important public lands, including public lands in Colorado, through community-supported land use  designations that limit inappropriate  development and maintain recreational access.   It  designates Camp Hale as the Nation\u2019s first  National Historic  Landscape to honor World War II  veterans and Colorado\u2019s  military legacy.  Furthermore, it provides  permanent protection of  more than 1 million acres around the Grand Canyon National Park from new mining claims.  The Grand Canyon is a majestic national  treasure, drawing Americans from across the country to visit, and numerous  Tribal Nations  regard it as  a sacred place. H.R. 803 puts in place protections for some of our nation\u2019s most iconic natural and cultural  resources and safeguards recreational opportunities for the benefit of current and future  generations, while  creating jobs and investing in the recreation economy.  It  is also consistent with the recommendation of scientists that, to safeguard the health and productivity of the natural  systems upon which we all depend, the Nation  must pursue a  goal of  conserving at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and ocean by 2030.  The Administration looks forward to working with the  Congress on this legislation  to ensure the best durable management of these special areas.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 256, to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (\u201c2002 AUMF\u201d). This bipartisan legislation would terminate the October 16, 2002, statutory authorization for the use of military force against Iraq. The Administration supports the repeal of the 2002 AUMF, as the United States has no ongoing military activities that rely solely on the 2002 AUMF as a domestic legal basis, and repeal of the 2002 AUMF would likely have minimal impact on current military operations. Furthermore, the President is  committed  to working with the Congress to ensure that outdated authorizations for the use of military force are replaced with a narrow and specific framework appropriate to ensure that we can continue to protect Americans from terrorist threats. In working with the Congress on repealing and replacing other existing authorizations of military force, the Administration seeks to ensure that the Congress has a clear and thorough understanding of the effect of any such action and of the threats facing U.S. forces, personnel, and interests around the world.  As the Administration works with the Congress to reform AUMFs, it will be critical to maintain the clear authority to address threats to the United States\u2019 national interests with appropriately decisive and effective military action.   ** * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports House  passage of  H.R. 5, the Equality  Act, which would amend  existing  Federal  civil rights laws to expressly include non-discrimination protection on the basis of sex, including  gender identity and sexual orientation. Many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals  often continue to face discrimination, harassment, and violence at  work, at  school, and in public accommodations.  H.R. 5 would amend existing  Federal  civil rights laws to expressly  include non-discrimination  protection on the basis of sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), providing  security  and equality to LGBTQ+ Americans in accessing housing, employment, education, public accommodations, healthcare and other  federally  funded services, credit, and more.  The Supreme Court has already ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County, No. 17-1618, 590 U.S. (2020), that employees are protected from discrimination on the basis of sex (including  gender identity  and sexual orientation) under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The Equality Act  confirms the implications of  Bostock for other discrimination laws, consistent with the  President\u2019s  Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of  Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation, issued January 20, 2021, and further  builds on Bostock, thereby securing such protections once and for all  for LGBTQ+ Americans  across  Federal civil rights laws.  Women also currently lack protection against sex discrimination in public  accommodations and federally funded programs; the Equality Act would fill that gap in the law  as well.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports passage of H.R. 3485 the Global Respect Act, which would mandate the listing of, and, visa restrictions on foreign persons responsible for or complicit in human rights violations against  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons.  In the face of rising violence targeting LGBTQI+ persons around the world, the Administration recognizes that LGBTQI+ persons face serious and unique threats to their safety due to their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or sex characteristics.  While many countries have made tremendous strides in embracing equality for LGBTQI+ community members, others remain stagnant or, worse, are undertaking steps to further marginalize or harm LGBTQI+ community members.   To address these threats, the Administration has taken historic actions to accelerate the march toward full LGBTQI+ equality at home and abroad.  The Administration is working to protect the civil rights of all LGBTQI+ persons in the United States, to enable all qualified people\u2013  including transgender people \u2013 to serve their country in uniform, to promote leadership opportunities for LGBTQI+ people at every level of the Federal government, to  advocate for countries to adopt LGBTQI+ friendly policies, to  provide full accreditation and fair treatment to same-sex spouses of our diplomatic personnel and family members overseas, and to protect and defend the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons around the world.  These actions serve to demonstrate that the Administration is a consistent and reliable partner in the fight for equality at home and abroad.  Globally, the Administration\u2019s efforts are guided by the Presidential Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons Around the World.  To further guide implementation of the Memorandum, President Biden appointed the Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons and ensured that Pride flags fly at  U.S. Embassies and Consulates.  Collectively, these actions demonstrate United States leadership in support of LGBTQI+ human rights around the world.  H.R. 3485 is a bi-partisan bill that would, among other provisions, require the Administration to provide Congress with a list of foreign individuals found responsible for human rights violations against LGBTQI+ persons abroad.  Individuals included on this list would be ineligible for visas to, or entry into, the United States.  While the sentiments reflected in this bill are deeply shared, the Administration urges Congress to ensure that the policies provide appropriate flexibility to act in the national interest.     While this legislation focuses on foreign persons  and foreign affairs, the Administration also believes too many  LGBTQI+  people  across our nation continue facing discrimination and hate, especially  LGBTQI+ people of color and transgender people.  Some States are attempting to turn  back the clock on equality  through passing  discriminatory bills that target LGBTQI+ people and families.  The Administration reaffirms that no one should face discrimination or harassment because of who they  are  or whom they love.  As President Biden said during his first joint  address to Congress, the  President has the back of  LGBTQI+ people across the country and will  continue fighting for full  equality for every  person in America  \u2013  including through continuing to urge the U.S. Senate to pass the Equality Act and providing  overdue civil rights protections to LGBTQI+ people and families  across the country.

Democracy is in peril, here, in America.  The right to vote \u2013 a sacred right in this country \u2013 is under assault with an intensity and an aggressiveness we have not seen in a long time.  The election of 2020 and its violent aftermath on January 6, 2021, when an armed mob of insurrectionists sought to overturn the voice of the people and a duly certified election, reminds us that our democracy is fragile.  This landmark legislation is needed to protect the right to vote, ensure the integrity of our elections, and repair and strengthen American democracy. The For the People Act also would reform redistricting to curtail the partisan gerrymandering that distorts our democracy.  It would modernize our elections system and make those systems more secure.  Consistent with the Administration\u2019s commitment to racial equity, the bill would also expand the tools available to the Justice Department to enforce the voting rights of all Americans.  It would reform our campaign finance system with more transparency.  It would establish stronger ethics rules for all three branches of government.  These provisions would also serve to help restore confidence in our government, and in democratic institutions. Since H.R. 1 passed in the House of Representatives, the assault on our democracy has intensified.  In state after state, new restrictive laws on voting, and efforts to replace non-partisan election administration with partisan processes designed to overturn the will of the voters have become more widespread.  The Administration applauds the efforts in the Senate to incorporate feedback that refines and strengthens the bill, and would make its reforms easier for states to implement.

The urgency  to protect women\u2019s health, their  fundamental right to control their  reproductive choices, and the freedom of all people to build their own future  has never been  greater.  The position of the Biden Administration has been  clear  since Day  One:  We will defend  women\u2019s  constitutional rights recognized  in  Roe v.  Wade  nearly half a century  ago\u2014rights  that have been under  attack for decades, and  are under unprecedented threat now, despite  strong support  from the American people.  State laws designed to restrict access to abortion have increased at an  alarming  rate  recently\u2014in Texas, Mississippi, and many other states around the  country.  These extreme laws  are endangering the freedom  and safety of all women, and they are  particularly devastating  for those who have  fewer  options and resources, such as low-income women and those in underserved communities, including women of  color and many in rural  areas.   It is evident that the constitutional rights protected  for nearly 50 years  are now in severe jeopardy.  It  is imperative  for Congress to act to  adopt statutory protections for women\u2019s  access  to essential health care services and reproductive choice,  regardless of  where they live.  Congress  must further act to protect  health care providers\u2019 ability to  provide  such critical services free from  unwarranted and inappropriate restrictions, and to eliminate unjustified  burdens on commerce that prevent women and their families from participating fully  and equally in the  economic and social life of the United States.  The protections that the  Women\u2019s Health Protection Act would ensure  are essential to the health,  safety, and progress of our nation.   Congress should advance this important bill with  the  utmost urgency this moment demands.  The  President looks forward to working  with Congress throughout the legislative process  and signing  the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act into law.  * * * * * * *  ", " ", "The Administration strongly opposes  Senate passage of Senate Joint Resolution 29  to nullify the Department of Labor\u2019s  COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing  Emergency Temporary Standard  (ETS),  which became effective on November 5, 2021.  If Congress were to  pass  this resolution of disapproval, the President\u2019s advisors would strongly  recommend that he  veto the resolution.  The COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing  ETS  is necessary  to protect workers from the grave  danger that they  face in their workplace  during  the devastating COVID-19  pandemic.   The  President wants to see  Americans back on the job, and Americans back at work  should not face  risk from those who are  not  vaccinated and  who  refuse  to be tested.  In 1970, President Nixon signed the Occupational Safety  and Health Act to give  the Department  of Labor\u2019s  Occupational Safety  and Health Administration (OSHA) the responsibility to issue an emergency standard when workers are  faced with a grave danger  such as  COVID-19.  Relying  on the latest science, OSHA\u2019s ETS, once  fully implemented, would  give large  employers the choice between adopting  either:  1) a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy; or 2) a policy  requiring employees to get vaccinated or  take  a COVID-19 test  on at least a weekly basis  and wear a face  covering at work.  The vast majority of adults are fully vaccinated, and thus  face no burden from implementation  of the OSHA rule.  The  rule exempts small businesses, which likewise face no burden from the  rule.  What the rule does do is provide  a common-sense protection for  workers at large firms.  At a time when COVID is on the rise, a new variant is on the loose, and more  Americans are  choosing to be vaccinated, it makes no sense for  Congress to reverse this much-needed protection of our workforce.  It puts our recovery in  danger, and a vote for this resolution risks a  return to shutdowns, layoffs, and closures that  result from allowing COVID  to spread more  easily in the workplace.   In a time of crisis, Congress should support workers\u2019  safety  and protect our recovery, rather than blocking  OSHA\u2019s standard.    * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports H.R. 1836,  which  would expand eligibility  criteria for  certain education benefits.  Current law defines the term \u201cactive duty\u201d  as those individuals who are on full-time duty in the active military service of the  United States, including full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in the  active military service, at a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the military department concerned.  H.R. 1836 would expand eligibility  criteria to include those  training in full-time National Guard duty, which includes the National Guard, the Army National Guard, and the Air National Guard, as well as those same members when performing  active duty.  The Administration supports the EVEST Act\u2019s goal of seamless enrollment in health care  coverage.  As currently  written, H.R. 4673  would require  the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA)  to automatically  enroll new veterans into VA health care,  and notify  veterans  of their enrollment and instructions on how to un-enroll, if desired.  There may be challenges  implementing  this bill  as drafted,  and  the Administration  looks forward to working with Congress on how best to operationalize its objective.  * * * * * *   ", "The Administration  strongly  supports House passage of H.R. 4505, making  appropriations for the  Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science,  and Related Agencies for the fiscal  year (FY)  ending September 30, 2022,  and for other purposes.   Over the past decade, due in large measure to overly restrictive budget  caps, the Nation  significantly underinvested in core priorities  such as  education, research, and public health that  are vital to our prosperity and strength.  We  have  seen the consequences of this broad disinvestment in our lack of preparedness to effectively respond to a  global pandemic.  We see it  in global competitors that are catching up or even surpassing the  United States in research and development.   In addition,  we see it in longstanding inequities that have been deepened by  chronic underinvestment in programs that  are drivers of opportunity, such as Head Start and K-12 education.  These cuts to public investment in basic services and protections have cost us all\u2014and the moment to begin reversing this troubling trend is now.   The Administration is eager to incorporate the best ideas to reinvest in America.   What we cannot  accept is a continuation of damaging and self-defeating disinvestment.   Instead, we must seize this moment to invest in our future\u2014building  an economy that works for  everyone, not just those  at the top; tackling the  generational challenge of  climate change; competing with rising powers  and maintaining  our position as global leader; and preparing for the full range of challenges and opportunities ahead of us.   The President\u2019s  FY  2022 Budget details a  robust set of discretionary proposals to help deliver that  future by reinvesting in the foundations of our  Nation\u2019s strength.  The  Administration strongly  supports the House Appropriations Committee in putting forth FY  2022 bills that reflect these  shared  priorities.    The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share  additional views regarding the  House Appropriations Committee\u2019s version of the bill.   Department of Commerce   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Satellites.  The Administration  appreciates the increased funding to initiate next generation weather satellites.   However, the Administration  urges  the Congress to fund the  full FY 2022 Budget  request  for the Geostationary  Earth Orbit program in order to develop a highly-capable system  as expeditiously  as possible.      NOAA Operations.   The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s recognition of NOAA\u2019s role  in addressing the climate  crisis.   The bill provides $585 million in new investments across  NOAA, including the requested increases for offshore wind and climate-ready fisheries.   However, the Administration urges the Congress  to fully fund the FY  2022 Budget  request for  other high priority NOAA programs, such  as those supporting  coastal resilience and  climate competitive research.    National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST)  Manufacturing.  The Administration  appreciates the requested $125 million increase above the FY 2021 enacted level for the NIST  Manufacturing Extension Partnership.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to provide the full  FY 2022 Budget  request for Manufacturing USA institutes.  The Administration  believes that a comprehensive manufacturing strategy  is crucial to bringing jobs back to the  United States, and that the Manufacturing USA institutes play a critical role in that effort.     Minority Business Development Agency  (MBDA).  The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s support for investing in minority-owned businesses.  The funds provided in the bill  would enable MBDA to improve  the reach of the bureau\u2019s technical  assistance programs,  eliminate barriers, and expand opportunities for minority-owned businesses.    Department of Justice  (DOJ)   Civil Rights.   The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s  strong  support  for  civil rights  activities at the  DOJ.  The bill provides  $221 million, which would strengthen  the important work of the Civil Rights Division, including  pattern-or-practice investigations,  the prosecution of  hate crimes, and voting rights  protections.   This funding  would  also support  the  Community Relations  Service work to reduce  community conflicts and tensions  and would  provide resources  to expand the Department\u2019s access-to-justice work.    Office on Violence Against  Women Funding.  The Administration  strongly supports  the $240  million increase provided to support Violence Against Women Act programs at  DOJ, including funding to support new programs requested in the President\u2019s  FY 2022 Budget.  However, the Administration urges the Congress to provide  the full $1 billion requested  in order  to support  these vital programs and activities.    Executive Office of Immigration Review.   The Administration  appreciates  the $891 million provided to the Executive Office for  Immigration Review.  These  resources would  support the  addition of 100  immigration judge teams and  other enhancements that would  help  to reduce  the case backlog at the immigration courts.    Legal Representation for Immigrant Children and Families.  The Administration  appreciates  the  $50  million provided to support the  Legal  Representation for  Immigrant Children and Families  program.   This  pilot program would  support awards to provide legal representation to children  and families in  removal  proceedings, enabling those proceedings to operate  more equitably and efficiently.     2    Gun Violence  Reduction.  The Administration  strongly supports  the $2.1 billion provided by the  Committee  to fund  activities to combat gun violence  in communities across the  Nation, including  funds essential to advance the President\u2019s comprehensive strategy  to reduce gun crimes.  These resources  would support  the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and Explosives  (ATF), the Federal  Bureau of  Investigations, as well as DOJ grant programs.  The  Administration appreciates the strong support  in the bill for evidence-based, innovative programs that  would  make communities safer, such as  a new  $100  million  Community Violence  Intervention initiative  at Justice to complement additional funding requested by the  Administration at the Department of  Health and Human  Services.  Together  with funding for other programs the Administration has  requested, these resources would strengthen DOJ\u2019s response to gun crime  and  enhance public  safety.   First Step Act.   The Administration strongly supports the $409 million provided to the Bureau of  Prisons to aid in further implementation of the First Step Act.   These funds would  expand  high-quality programming, substance use disorder treatment, and reentry support.   Reducing Overdose Deaths.   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for the  Office of Justice Programs to reduce the overdose death rate through fully funding the  FY  2022  Budget request  which includes critical programs such as:   the Comprehensive Opioid, Stimulant, and Substance Abuse Program; Drug Courts; the Residential Substance Abuse  Treatment Program; the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program; the Prescription Drug  Monitoring Program; and the Veterans Treatment  Court Grant Program.   Antitrust Division.  The  Administration appreciates the strong support provided to the Antitrust  Division.  The bill includes $201 million, equal to the  FY 2022 Budget  request, which would  allow  the Antitrust Division  to promote a  fair, open, and competitive marketplace.    Juvenile Justice Programs.   The Administration  appreciates  the $148 million increase provided for Juvenile Justice Programs, but urges the Congress to consider providing an additional  $302  million to match the  FY 2022 Budget request, including full funding for the Community-Based  Alternatives to  Incarceration program.   Guantanamo Bay.  The Administration  appreciates that the bill supports the  FY 2022 Budget  request to remove provisions that effectively prohibit the closure of facilities at United States  Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).   The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s strong support for NASA.  The $25 billion provided in the bill would  enhance NASA\u2019s Earth science and aeronautics  work to address the climate crisis, enable the Artemis  program to land American astronauts on the Moon, and expand STEM engagement efforts.  The result would  be a robust  and inspirational space program that addresses the critical challenges of  our times.    3    National Science  Foundation (NSF)   NSF Topline.   The Administration appreciates the  Committee\u2019s strong support for NSF\u2019s  climate  and clean energy R&D, broadening participation programs, and the  creation of the new  Directorate to speed the transfer of NSF\u2019s discoveries into innovations that would benefit the American people.  However, the  Administration urges the Congress to provide the full FY 2022 Budget request  that would enable NSF to make further contributions to U.S. innovation and technological competitiveness.    Legal Services Corporation (LSC)   LSC  Topline.  The Administration strongly supports  the $600  million provided to LSC  to enhance its COVID-19 pandemic response, which is equal  to the  FY 2022 Budget  request.  These funds would expand access to  civil legal aid  and are  critical to assisting low-income individuals with  responding to legal issues, including those  driven by the  COVID-19 pandemic.     Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  (EEOC)   EEOC Topline.  The Administration appreciates  that  the  Committee provides  the full FY 2022 Budget request  for the  EEOC, which would help restore critical agency staff lost in recent  years  and finance key investigative, regulatory, and enforcement resources necessary to protect the  Nation\u2019s workers from workplace discrimination.     Constitutional  Concerns   Sections 509, 518, and 526 would in certain applications intrude upon the  President\u2019s  constitutional authority over international diplomacy.  The Administration looks forward to working with the  Congress to address these and other concerns.    The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the  FY 2022 appropriations  process moves forward.   * * * * * * *    4    ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 914, the Drinking Water and Wastewater  Infrastructure Act of 2021.  This legislation aligns with the  Administration\u2019s goals to upgrade  and modernize aging infrastructure, improve the health of children and small and disadvantaged communities, develop new technologies, and help address cybersecurity  threats  and mitigate  dangers from climate change.  Across the country, pipes and treatment plants are  aging, undermining the reliable delivery of  safe drinking water and allowing polluted wastewater to endanger public health and the environment.  Large portions of U.S. water and wastewater systems were built over a century  ago.  As pipes and plants reach the end of their expected lifespan, they must be upgraded and replaced.  An estimated six to ten million homes still receive drinking water through lead pipes and service lines.  S. 914 authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s core water infrastructure funding programs and continues the commitment to partnering with States, Tribes, and territories to invest in infrastructure projects in communities across the United States, ensuring that all Americans, especially those living  in underserved communities, have access to safe and clean water and opportunities for economic  growth.  S. 914 authorizes programs to address lead pipes and service lines in our drinking water systems.  It supports small, disadvantaged, and rural communities, including Tribal communities,  through grant programs that promote environmental justice.  S. 914 authorizes increased funding levels and provides program flexibilities to enable investments in water projects that address aging infrastructure, improve  availability and access to drinking water and wastewater services, and improve water quality.  It authorizes programs to connect households to public water and wastewater services, provide technical assistance on decentralized wastewater systems, and improve sanitation in rural Alaska and Alaska Native villages.  S. 914 promotes resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate change and makes explicit that cybersecurity  projects are eligible for key programs.  The legislation also authorizes funding to address recruitment, training, and retention challenges facing the water  and wastewater utility workforce. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this bipartisan legislation to strengthen our nation\u2019s water systems.   This bill is a good start to the much-needed funding  required to  provide  communities with the water quality they deserve  and create good-paying  jobs.   ", "The Administration strongly supports enactment of a National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for a 61st consecutive year and is grateful for the strong, bipartisan work this year by the House Armed Services Committee on behalf of America\u2019s national defense.   The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with Congress to set an appropriate and responsible level of defense spending to support the security of the Nation.  At the same time, the Administration looks forward to working with Congress to provide appropriate resources for non-security investments and security investments outside the Department of Defense (DOD).  A strong economy is critical to ensuring our Nation is positioned for strategic competition, and investments in diplomacy, development, and economic statecraft enhance the effectiveness of national defense spending and promote national security. The Administration opposes the direction to add funding for platforms and systems that cannot be affordably modernized given the need to prioritize survivable, lethal, and resilient forces in the current threat environment and eliminate wasteful spending.  Our national security interests require forces that can fight across the spectrum of conflict.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address its concerns, a number of which are outlined below.  The Administration also looks forward to reviewing the classified annex to the committee report and working with the Congress to address any concerns about classified programs. Optimizing Program Investments and Modernization.  The Administration strongly opposes restoration of funding to systems that limit DOD\u2019s ability to divest or retire lower priority platforms not relevant to tomorrow\u2019s battlefield.  The President\u2019s Budget divests or retires vulnerable and costly platforms that no longer meet mission or security needs, and reinvests those savings in transformational, innovative assets that match the dynamic threat landscape and advance the capabilities of the force of the future.  The Administration strongly opposes language limiting retirement or inactivation of Ticonderoga Class Cruisers (section 1017).  The Administration also strongly opposes language that would establish minimum inventory requirements of systems such as the KC-10 (section 133) and tactical airlift aircraft (section 134), which would limit the Department\u2019s flexibility to prioritize resource investment, delay modernization of capabilities, and impede implementation of the National Defense Strategy. 1    Afghanistan Security Forces Fund.  The Administration appreciates the authority provided in section 1212 to enable the responsible termination of the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF).  The termination will involve, at a minimum, closing out several hundred contracts and in many cases negotiating financial settlements with the contractors, developing a full accounting for all ASFF-funded equipment and supplies that are outside Afghanistan, and assessing potential contract settlement costs and the cost of transporting and storing ASFF-funded materiel for purposes of treating it as DOD stocks.  More analysis is necessary to develop prudent estimates of these costs and of timelines for completing these actions.   Recommendations of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault (IRC).  The Administration commends the determined effort to advance our shared goal of making real progress on preventing and, when prevention fails, improving the response to sexual assault and other related crimes, as well as supporting survivors.  Additionally, the Administration appreciates the willingness to build rapidly on the work of the IRC by seeking to enshrine many of its recommendations in law and looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure these recommendations are implemented effectively and achieve their intended results.    Section 533, as currently written, would require each Service\u2019s Office of Special Victim Prosecutors (OSVP) to be headed by a general or flag officer who would report directly to the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, without intervening authority.  To preserve the Secretaries\u2019 discretion, the Administration believes that language should be added to this section to allow the Secretary of a Military Department to choose a supervisor of the OSVP that is a Senior Executive Service civilian with equivalent experience.   The Administration recommends amendments to the qualification standards in section 532 in order to permit otherwise highly-qualified judge advocates at the grade of O-5 or higher to be able to serve as a Special Victim Prosecutor (SVP) in light of limitations on the number of personnel at grade O-6 or higher currently available to fill these positions.  Additionally, the Administration recommends requiring a minimum of three years of relevant criminal justice experience for Assistant SVPs, due to the challenges of ensuring sufficient personnel with five or more years of experience.  Though the Administration sees great benefit in facilitating victim access to protective orders and maximizing such orders\u2019 effectiveness, the Administration believes that additional time is needed in order to study the military judicial resources implications of the changes proposed in section 529.  The Administration recommends requiring the completion of an implementation study within one year of enactment, followed by the requirement to develop regulations implementing this section within two years of enactment.  Finally, the Administration urges Congress to pass its requested sexual harassment punitive articles.   Other Military Justice Measures.  Though the Administration similarly appreciates the commitment to further improving the military justice system, the Administration opposes provisions that could have unintended and deleterious impacts on the administration of justice and DOD\u2019s related programs.  The Administration strongly opposes section 517 as currently written, which authorizes the Secretaries of the Military Departments to act on characterization of service determinations notwithstanding the separation board\u2019s recommendation, and 2   recommends that a study be undertaken instead to assess potential changes.  Further, the Administration is concerned that military criminal investigative organizations (MCIOs) lack the personnel and resources to complete section 528\u2019s notification requirement within 180 days.  Many of the individuals who would have to be notified are no longer in the military and MCIOs would have to conduct a search for their current contact information.  Therefore, the 180-day timeframe is not feasible.   Space National Guard (SNG).  The Administration strongly opposes the creation of a Space National Guard.  When the Space Force was established, Congress and the Administration alike emphasized the need to minimize administrative expenses and prioritize the development of space capabilities; this Administration remains committed to that approach.  Establishing a Space National Guard would not deliver new capabilities\u2014it would instead create new government bureaucracy, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates could increase costs by up to $500 million annually.  The Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units with space missions have effectively performed their roles with no adverse effect on DOD\u2019s space mission since the establishment of the Space Force.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on alternative Space Force concepts that are efficient, effective, and appropriate for space missions.  Limitations on Use of Funds in the National Defense Sealift Fund.  The Administration urges support for the necessary relief to recapitalize the sealift fleet with used vessels by removing existing statutory limitations.  The Administration strongly encourages Congress to remove the statutory cap on the number of used sealift vessels DOD can procure and to remove the statutory link between the use of National Defense Sealift funding for the purchase of used vessels and the requirement to procure new construction vessels. This will allow the Administration to recapitalize the sealift fleet, with all used ship conversions in U.S. shipyards, for a fraction of the cost of procuring new vessels.  F-35 Sustainment Costs. The Administration strongly opposes section 141, as it places artificial constraints on F-35 aircraft inventory using outdated and unrealistic fiscally-constrained F-35A affordability targets. Based on current F-35 sustainment cost estimates, DOD does not see a realistic path to reach the $4.1 million (Constant Year 2012 dollars) cost per tail per year affordability target for the F-35A.   Basic Needs Allowance For Low-Income Regular Members.  The Administration supports a basic needs allowance. The Administration needs a more comprehensive data analysis to determine the inclusion or exclusion of basic allowance for housing. Using this analysis, the Administration would like to work with Congress to develop an appropriate calculation for targeting recipients of a basic needs allowance.     Countering Extremism in the Armed Forces.  The Administration shares the goal of preventing prohibited extremist activities and holding offenders accountable, but opposes section 529A, because it would impose onerous and overly specific training and data collection requirements and would foreclose other options to address extremism.  3   Prohibition on Adverse Personnel Actions Taken Against Certain Members of the Armed Forces Based on Declining COVID-19 Vaccine and Expansion of Exemptions from Vaccination Requirement.  The Administration strongly opposes section 716, which would detract from readiness and limit a commander\u2019s options for enforcing good order and discipline when a Service member fails to obey a lawful order to receive a vaccination.  To enable a uniformed force to fight with discipline, commanders must have the ability to give orders and take appropriate disciplinary measures.  The Administration also strongly opposes section 720, which would create a new and overly broad exemption from the vaccination requirement for previous infection that would undermine the effectiveness of the requirement.  The Department will make available a full range of resources to Service members, including individual and professional medical advice, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine and to ensure they are fully informed about vaccination.  Minimum Wage for Employees of Department of Defense Contractors.  Although the Administration supports contract workers and increasing the minimum wage for workers under federal contracts, it objects to section 804 because it is inconsistent with E.O. 14026, \u201cIncreasing the Minimum Wage for Federal Contractors.\u201d  Different application depending on whether or not the contract is with DOD or another Federal department or agency would lead to significant confusion by applying different requirements to many of the same contractors  Global Bulk Fuel Management and Delivery.  The Administration strongly opposes section 342, which would designate a single combatant command to be responsible for global bulk fuel management and delivery.  This designation would not address the challenges posed by the degraded availability and survivability of assets supporting the distribution of fuel to dispersed and austere operating locations and the need for rapid decision-making in support of changing operational environments. It would also introduce significant risk by degrading the Joint Force\u2019s ability to meet operational requirements.   Modification of Restriction on Department of Defense Procurement of Certain Items Containing Perfluorooctane Sulfonate or Perfluorooctanoic Acid.  The Administration is committed to working with Congress to address the challenges posed by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).  However, it is concerned with section 317 which would prohibit DOD from procuring a wide range of items that may contain PFAS.  If implemented in its current form, it would not be feasible for DOD to test all of these items to determine if they contain PFAS.  In addition, some of these products may not have PFAS-free alternatives available.  The Administration will continue to work with Congress to both address PFAS contamination and find alternative products and solutions.  Information Regarding Solicitation and Award of Subcontracts Under Military Construction Contracts.  The Administration strongly opposes section 2803, which would create burdensome new information collection and reporting requirements that would impose an unfunded mandate on industry while contradicting the Paperwork Reduction Act and providing no benefit to project execution.    4   Limitation on Availability of Funds for the B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP).  The Administration strongly opposes section 132, which would limit the availability of funds for the B-52 CERP and establish a premature and inadequate cost estimate for the program.  This would delay the CERP and postpone delivery of new commercial engines for the B-52 by up to two years.  Such a delay from 2029 to 2031 would exceed the projected 2030 end of life for the current B-52 TF-33 engines and add risk to B-52 availability.    Missile Defense Radar in Hawaii.  The Administration strongly opposes the requirement in section 1643 to certify funding for the Homeland Defense Radar \u2013 Hawaii (HDR-H).  The Department had planned to field HDR-H, the Pacific Radar, the Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), and the Long Range Discrimination Radar by the mid-2020s as a system of systems to improve homeland ballistic missile defense.  The Pacific Radar has been delayed indefinitely due to stalled negotiations with the host nation, and the RKV program has been cancelled.  Hawaii is currently defended against missile threats to the same extent as the rest of the United States, and DOD is currently investing in other capabilities, such as the Next Generation Interceptor, which will support the long-term defense of Hawaii.   Authority of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security to Engage in Fundraising for Certain Nonprofit Organizations.  The Administration strongly opposes section 1613, which runs counter to longstanding law and policy that prohibits Federal personnel from fundraising on behalf of non-Federal entities.  This would unnecessarily and improperly entangle senior DOD personnel in the fundraising and operations of potentially numerous non-Federal entities.   Reprioritization of Military Construction Funding to Unrequested Projects.  The Administration opposes the bill\u2019s realignment of military construction funding from priority projects to other projects.  Contrary to the Administration\u2019s fiscally responsible policy to fully fund projects, the bill proposes to fund 12 military construction projects incrementally, effectively creating an unfunded obligation of almost $900 million needed to fully fund these projects over time.  The bill diverts these funds to other unrequested projects.  Fallon Range Training Complex (FRTC) Modernization.  The Administration urges Congress to adopt DOD\u2019s request to expand the FRTC to provide the area needed to fully accommodate modern military training requirements while upholding Tribal trust responsibilities and responsible management of public lands.   Modernization of the Selective Service System.  The Administration supports section 513 and the registration requirement for all citizens, which further ensures a military selective system that is fair and just.  However, the Administration opposes the removal in subsection (f) of Federal incentives for registration, which must remain to achieve an equitable system that can be implemented effectively.      5   Nuclear Weapons Provisions.  The Administration opposes several provisions that would pre-judge the outcome of the Nuclear Posture Review now underway.  These include the prohibition on funding for extending the service life of the B83-1, the restrictions on changing intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) alert levels or the number of deployed ICBMs, and the prohibition on reconverting or retiring W76-2 warheads.  Defense Review Requirements.  The Administration objects to requirements in section 1653, which purport to require the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the U.S. STRATCOM Commander to provide pre-decisional and deliberative materials associated with the Integrated Deterrence Review, as well as the Nuclear Posture Review and Missile Defense Review.  These requirements encroach on the constitutional prerogatives of the President.  Significant Foreign Policy Provisions Relevant to Defense Matters.  The Administration is concerned that the bill includes certain provisions requiring DOD engagement in, analysis\u202fof, or reporting on significant foreign policy issues, that lack a sufficient means for State involvement and looks forward to working with Congress on these matters.  Anomalous Health Incidents.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s continued engagement on anomalous health incidents and would like to work with the Congress to reconcile structural and reporting requirement differences between these sections and other proposed legislation in order to standardize inter-agency processes, increase multi-committee reporting, and increase pro-active care options to affected individuals.  Constitutional Concerns.  Certain provisions of the bill, such as sections 901 and 1232, raise constitutional concerns.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to address these and other constitutional concerns.    6  ", "The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to  ensure that  this  bipartisan  legislation  achieves its purposes,  continues  expanding  opportunity  for all  Americans, and ultimately is enacted.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly  supports H.R. 3967,  which would expand veterans\u2019  access to health care  and benefits to address the health effects of harmful environmental exposures that occurred during military service.  The President believes that our  Nation  has only one truly sacred obligation: to properly prepare  and equip our service members when we send them into harm\u2019s way and to care  for them and their families when they  return home.   Far too often, military service  comes with a cost, and we  owe it to our veterans and their families to address these consequences  comprehensively. Unfortunately, it has taken decades to understand the deleterious effects of environmental exposures\u2014leaving too many without access to the benefits and services they need.  H.R.  3967  would make changes to the definitions for who is eligible for VA health care based on presumed toxic exposure during military service, including  from burn pits,  radiation, or other environmental conditions.   H.R. 3967 would also  make changes to the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA\u2019s)  process for determining  presumptive  service  connection and  mandate several  research studies related to military related environmental exposures. It would also establish new registries related to exposures, which would provide new data on the long-term impacts from environmental exposures.   H.R. 3697 also would  allow a  Federal cause of action related to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina  and establish training requirements for health providers,  and require  an outreach plan to educate veterans about their eligibility for  benefits and services  related to toxic exposure.  The Administration looks forward to working  with the Congress to  enact this legislation  and ensuring it is effectively implemented.  We  must  address the toxic legacy of environmental exposures sustained by  veterans during their military service  and fulfill our sacred obligation to our veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors.   We must also ensure that VA has the resources it needs to implement this legislation.  * * * * * *   ", "The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 5305, the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act.  H.R. 5305 would keep the federal government open, provide disaster relief, and avoid a catastrophic default so that the government can continue serving the American people without interruption as we continue to confront a pandemic, recover from and respond to disasters, and power an economic recovery.  At the same time, the window provided by this short-term Continuing Resolution will allow movement toward bipartisan agreement on smart, full-year appropriations bills for fiscal year 2022 that reinvest in core priorities, meet the needs of American families, businesses, and communities, and lay a strong foundation for the future.  In addition to providing short-term funding for core government operations, H.R. 5305 provides $6.3 billion in emergency spending to support Operation Allies Welcome, a multifaceted, historic interagency mission.  The operation to move out of danger and to safety tens of thousands of Afghans at risk, including many who helped us during our two decades in Afghanistan, represents an extraordinary military, diplomatic, security, and humanitarian operation by the U.S. Government.  The Administration appreciates the funding provided to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement to provide resettlement and essential support services to individuals relocated to the United States from Afghanistan, as well as legislative language that would make these individuals eligible for federal benefits.  However, the Administration is deeply disappointed that the bill fails to provide the authority requested to fully resettle Afghans, and to adjust their status, thereby obstructing them in building successful new lives in their new communities in the United States.  The Administration also strongly supports the $28.6 billion in disaster relief funding to help impacted states and tribes recover from recent extreme weather events and natural disasters.  This includes disasters from the last 18 months\u2014such as Hurricanes Laura and Delta\u2014for which there are remaining unmet needs.  We also appreciate the down payment for more recent disasters, including wildfires and Hurricane Ida. Finally, the Administration strongly supports suspending the debt limit until December 2022, which will preserve the full faith and credit of the United States and avoid a catastrophic default.  The length of this suspension represents obligations that bipartisan majorities in Congress strongly supported incurring last year as part of this nation\u2019s response to COVID\u2014 indeed, bipartisan majorities even took public credit for incurring these necessary expenses.  Having led and passed legislation authorizing these expenses, these same bipartisan majorities should honor the obligation to fund them.  Suspending the debt limit allows the Treasury to finance spending Congress has already authorized and to keep its commitments without causing disruption or harm to our economy and families.  This is a bipartisan responsibility that must be met in a timely fashion, just as it was three times under the prior administration, and almost 80 times in the last 60 years under administrations from both parties.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to pass full-year appropriations bills in December that make bold, forward-looking investments in our future.   * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of S.J.

Reg. 68742 (October 30, 2020)), under the Congressional Review Act.  The rule that S.J.

The  Administration will continue  to work  with Congress  throughout the legislative  process to pass a bill  that is grounded in constitutional principles  and a  commitment to protecting  and improving our democracy, and that appropriately  addresses the balance of powers between the three branches of our  Federal government, including  by upholding the longstanding  interests of the Executive Branch that are essential to effective  governance  and efficient use of taxpayer resources  and consistent with our constitutional structure.   In doing so, the  Administration will work to ensure that no branch  of government  is able to abuse its authority or undermine a co-equal branch\u2019s constitutional prerogatives, no matter who is in power.   * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration  strongly  supports House passage of H.R. 4373, making  appropriations for the  Department of State,  Foreign Operations, and Related Programs for the fiscal  year  (FY) ending  September 30, 2022, and for other purposes.   Over the past decade, due in large measure to overly restrictive budget  caps, the Nation  significantly underinvested in core priorities such as education, research, and public health that  are vital to our prosperity and strength.  We have seen the consequences of this broad disinvestment in our lack of preparedness to effectively respond to a  global  pandemic.  We see it  in global competitors that are catching up or even surpassing the  United States in  research and  development.  In addition, we see it in longstanding inequities that have been deepened by  chronic underinvestment in programs that are drivers of opportunity, such as Head Start and K-12 education.  These cuts to public investment in basic services and protections have cost us all\u2014and the moment to begin reversing this troubling trend is now.   The Administration is eager to incorporate the best ideas to reinvest in America.  What we  cannot  accept is a continuation of damaging and self-defeating disinvestment.  Instead, we must seize  this moment to invest in our future\u2014building  an economy that works for  everyone, not just those  at the top; tackling the  generational challenge of  climate change; competing with rising powers  and maintaining our position as a global leader; and preparing for the full range of challenges  and opportunities ahead of us.   The President\u2019s  FY 2022 Budget details a  robust set of discretionary proposals to help deliver that  future by reinvesting in the foundations of our  Nation\u2019s strength.  The  Administration strongly  supports the House Appropriations Committee in putting forth FY 2022 bills that reflect these  shared priorities.    The Administration would like to take this opportunity to share  additional views regarding the House Appropriations Committee\u2019s version of the bill.   Department of State and  Other  International Programs   International Climate Change.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for U.S. international climate funding to reestablish the United States as a  global leader in climate finance  and catalyze climate  action worldwide.  The bill provides over $3 billion for global  climate and   environmental programs, including $1.9 billion for U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund and other multilateral climate initiatives.   Central America.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee provides $861 million for  Central America, as requested in the FY 2022 Budget, a strong show of support for the first  year  of the President\u2019s commitment to provide $4 billion to Central America over four  years.  However, the Administration is concerned that the bill limits flexibility and  includes a cap on the $861 million level and includes 75-percent withholding of assistance benefitting the central governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras from all Title 3 and 4 accounts.  The  Administration is also concerned that the bill continues the prohibition on providing  Foreign Military Financing (FMF) to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.    Global Health Security  and Other Critical Global  Health Programs.  The  Administration strongly  supports the Committee\u2019s inclusion of $1 billion for global health security  programs.  This  funding would enable the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) to invest in high-impact global health security programs, including to expand Global Health Security  Agenda  capacity-building programs to additional countries, support organizations leading the  global  COVID-19 pandemic response through the Act-Accelerator platform, and to replenish the  Emergency Reserve  Fund.  The Administration appreciates the inclusion of language in the bill  permitting contributions to an international financing mechanism for pandemic preparedness, which is an Administration priority; a financing  mechanism is critical to catalyze sustainable  financing for  global preparedness  efforts.   The Administration also appreciates the increases  provided in the bill  for Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning  and Reproductive Health.    Democracy Programs.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s inclusion of $2.5 billion for the Department of State and USAID democracy  programming, in addition to $300 million for  the National Endowment for Democracy.   The Administration looks forward to working with the  Congress to ensure adequate funding for  Democracy programs which  would allow the United States to play a larger  role in strengthening democratic institutions, fighting corruption, defending  against authoritarianism, and advancing human rights.   Gender.  The  Administration appreciates that the Committee provides $200 million for the  Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund, consistent with the FY 2022 Budget request.  In addition, the Administration appreciates the strong support for the Women, Peace, and Security  Act as well as the multiyear strategy to prevent and respond to gender-based violence in both conflict and non-conflict settings.    Information Technology Funding.  The Administration is disappointed that the bill funds the  Department of State\u2019s Capital  Investment  Fund (CIF)  at $275 million, $174 million or 40 percent  below the FY 2022 Budget request.   The FY  2022 Budget requested a substantial increase for CIF  to  address the national security threat posed by increasing cyberattacks.   Notably, the bill fails to  include  $101  million to safeguard the Department\u2019s cybersecurity infrastructure in direct response  to the SolarWinds incident.   While  the bill authorizes up to $150 million in transfer  authority  from  the Diplomatic Programs (DP) account to the CIF  account, no additional funds were provided in the DP account that would allow for the effective  use of this authority.    2    Unmet Commitments to International Financial Institutions.   The Administration appreciates that the bill provides a total of $62 million for unmet commitments to the African Development  Fund, the Asian Development Fund, and the Global Environment Facility.  The  bill provides no funding, however, for unmet commitments to the  International Development Association (IDA).  This  funding would provide needed resources so that  IDA can continue to provide high levels of  financing to help the world\u2019s poorest countries respond to and recover from the impacts of the  COVID-19  pandemic.      Debt Restructuring.  The Administration strongly  supports the Committee\u2019s inclusion of  $67  million for debt restructuring, consistent with the FY 2022 Budget request.  Specifically, the  Administration appreciates the support for the  Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI)  and the  Common Framework for Debt Treatments Beyond the DSSI.  This would provide the authority  and funding for official bilateral debt service suspension to low-income countries, allowing them to focus on responding to immediate health, economic, and social spending  needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and for deeper debt treatments for eligible  countries  as needed under the  Common Framework.   Middle East Assistance.   The  Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for key  partners in the Middle East, including  Israel and Jordan, and  economic and security assistance to  other key partners.   West Bank and Gaza.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support for security  assistance and increased economic assistance in the West Bank and Gaza and support for re-engagement with UNRWA.      International Organizations Contributions.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  inclusion of robust funding for assessed and voluntary  contributions to international  organizations, which would enable the United States to advance its own interests while leveraging  contributions from other  donors by supporting the  important work of our multilateral partners, including the United Nations (UN), the World Health Organization, the Montreal Protocol  Multilateral Fund, and the UN Population Fund.  However, the Administration looks forward to working  with the Congress on ensuring  robust U.S. leadership with the UN and UN-specialized  agencies.    International Peacekeeping Contributions.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s  support for meeting U.S. commitments to international peacekeeping by providing sufficient  funding to pay  U.S. dues on time and in full as well as for providing the requested authority and additional funds to begin paying down accumulated cap-related UN peacekeeping arrears in order  to fully fund peacekeeping arrears payments within two years.   Humanitarian Assistance.  The Administration appreciates that the Committee shares the  Administration\u2019s commitment to supporting vulnerable people  worldwide by  providing the  resources requested in the FY 2022 Budget to fulfill the President\u2019s commitment to rebuild the  Nation\u2019s badly damaged refugee admissions program, support up to 125,000 admissions in 2022, and assist vulnerable people abroad, including refugees and conflict victims.   3    Support for Diplomatic and Consular Operations.  The Administration appreciates the Committee\u2019s support  for diplomatic programs including:  worldwide security protection; embassy  security, construction, and maintenance; and consular processing programs.   USAID Operating Expenses.   The Administration is concerned that the bill does not fully provide  the level requested in the FY 2022 Budget for  USAID Operating Expenses.   Operating resources  at the level requested are  critical to expand USAID\u2019s workforce, support diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and would allow the Administration to respond more quickly and effectively  in development and humanitarian assistance programming and support  expanded global health security programs.    Flexibility on Incorporation of Report Tables  by Reference.   The Administration appreciates that section 7019(b) of the bill restores the Administration\u2019s flexibility to respond to significant, exigent, or unforeseen events, or to address other exceptional circumstances directly  related to U.S. national security interests.    Egypt.   The Administration strongly opposes section 7041(a) of the bill, which would reduce the  Administration\u2019s flexibility in regards to FMF to Egypt, undermining its leverage  as it operationalizes its commitment to a constructive human rights dialogue  with Egypt.    Protecting Europe\u2019s Energy Security Act of 2019 (PEESA)  Waiver Authority.   The Administration  has significant concerns regarding an amendment  adopted in Committee that would make  unavailable for all of FY  2022 the waiver  authority  under section 7503(f) of PEESA, as amended.  The mandate to impose sanctions\u2014particularly without waiver authority, which the Executive Branch always seeks to preserve flexibility  essential for implementing  foreign policy and to  calibrate imposition of sanctions\u2014would scuttle diplomatic efforts, impinge on the President\u2019s  authority to conduct foreign policy, and damage  U.S. relations with European Union member  states.    Constitutional  Concerns   Certain provisions of the  draft bill raise  constitutional concerns, including by  interfering with the  President\u2019s authority to determine the command of the armed  forces, to recognize territorial sovereignty, to receive foreign diplomats, and to conduct diplomacy in general.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to address these and other  concerns.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the  FY 2022 appropriations  process moves forward.   * * * * * * *   4    ", "The Administration  supports House passage of H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2021.   In  the wake of an unprecedented assault on our democracy, a never before  seen effort to ignore, undermine, and undo the will of the people, and a  newly  aggressive attack on voting rights taking  place right now all across the country, this landmark legislation is urgently  needed to protect the  right to vote and the integrity of our elections,  and to repair and strengthen American democracy.  H.R. 1 contains a number of provisions to protect the fundamental right to vote and make it  more  equitable and accessible for all  Americans  to exercise that right.   H.R. 1 would reform redistricting to curtail the gerrymandering that distorts our democracy, and would modernize our elections and make them more secure.   Consistent with the Administration\u2019s commitment to racial equity, the bill would also expand the tools  available to the Justice Department to enforce  the voting rights of all Americans.  H.R. 1 would also reform our campaign finance system to  amplify the voices of the public, not the powerful, and  establish stronger ethics rules for all three branches of government.  These  provisions  would  ensure  that government works for the people and  guard against  corruption across the highest levels of government.  As with any bill of this scope and complexity, the Administration looks forward to working  with Congress  to refine provisions of H.R. 1 as it  proceeds through the legislative process  to ensure  that the bill achieves lasting reform consistent with Congress\u2019 broad constitutional authority to strengthen our democracy.   * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 5376, the  Build Back  Better Act, which will make historic  investments in children and families, grow the economy, create  millions of good-paying  American jobs, enable more Americans to join and remain in the  workforce, expand access to health care,  set the United States on course to  meet its climate  goals, reduce costs for families, and strengthen the middle class.    The bill is the most significant investment in children and caregiving in generations.  It will cut  most families\u2019 child care  bills by half \u2014 or more  \u2014 and help millions of women who have left  the labor force return to work.  By  expanding preschool to three- and four-year-olds across  America, it will deliver  the largest expansion of universal and free education since states and  communities across the country established public high school 100 years ago.  It will cut taxes  for more than 35 million families  by  extending the  American Rescue Plan\u2019s  Child Tax Credit  expansion.  And the bill  expands access to high-quality home care  for older Americans and people  with disabilities.  The bill includes paid family  and medical leave, a provision that the  President has long supported and included in his original  Build Back Better Agenda.   The bill is also the largest effort to combat climate change in American history.   The increasing  frequency of devastating  hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, and other natural disasters underscores  the demand to  take action to combat climate change and make our communities and infrastructure more resilient.  Through grants, tax credits, rebates, private-sector incentives, loans  and loan guarantees, and Federal purchasing, the  Build Back Better Act will reduce our  carbon footprint, prepare communities for  extreme weather events, incentivize domestic manufacturing  to create high-paying jobs, promote energy  efficiency  and clean power sources, and propel the  United States to be a world leader in critical energy  supply chains.  It will cut annual greenhouse  gas pollution by  well over a  gigaton by 2030, setting the United States on a path to meet its  climate goals.   The bill is the most significant expansion of affordable health coverage in a decade.  It will give  Medicare the authority to negotiate prescription drug prices, and save Americans up to thousands  of dollars per  year on particularly costly  prescription drugs, which one in four Americans  struggle to afford.  It will ensure health care is affordable for  nine  million Americans by  extending  the American  Rescue Plan\u2019s  expanded  Premium Tax Credit  for Marketplace coverage, deliver health care  coverage to up to four million uninsured people in states that have locked them out of Medicaid, and increase access to  affordable hearing  coverage by  expanding  Medicare.    Immigrants are  critical not only to who we  are  as  a nation, but also to our economic strength and vitality.   The bill provides work permits for qualifying undocumented individuals who have lived in our country for decades.   This bill would provide relief to Dreamers, TPS recipients, immigrant farmworkers, and essential workers, among others.   The bill also includes important reforms to our legal immigration system, which will help reduce visa processing backlogs.    Finally, the bill is  the most significant effort to bring down costs and strengthen the middle class  in generations.  It makes  the single largest and most comprehensive investment in  affordable housing in history, expands access to affordable, high-quality education and training beyond high school, and cuts taxes for 17 million low-wage workers by extending the  expanded Earned Income Tax Credit.  This legislation also  advances equity through investments in maternal  health, community violence interventions, and child nutrition, in addition to better preparing the  nation for future pandemics and supply  chain disruptions.   The Build Back  Better Act  is fully paid for and will  not  increase the deficit; in fact, it  reduces  the deficit.   It does so  by making sure that large, profitable corporations can\u2019t zero out their tax bills, no longer rewarding corporations that shift jobs and profits overseas, requiring  millionaires and  billionaires  to pay their  fair share, and stopping  rich Americans from cheating on their tax bills.   Under this historic agreement, nobody earning less than $400,000 per  year  will pay a penny  more in taxes.   The  bill will reduce costs and  fuel  economic growth that will put more money in  the hands of the vast majority of American  workers while contributing to deficit reduction and fiscal responsibility.    The Administration urges Congress  to pass the  Build  Back Better Act.   We look forward to working  with Congress throughout the legislative  process and ensuring that we answer the  demands of the American people at this critical moment in history.    * * * * * * *   ", "The Administration  strongly  supports passage of H.R. 963, the Forced Arbitration Injustice  Repeal (FAIR) Act  of 2022.  This legislation  would prohibit two common practices \u2013  the  use  of pre-dispute arbitration clauses that force  arbitration of future employment, consumer, antitrust, or civil rights disputes; and waivers of the right to bring joint,  class, or collective  actions.   These practices deprive  workers  and consumers  of the  ability  to have their day in court when  companies violate their rights, including their  rights to minimum wage and overtime pay,  workplaces free  from discrimination, and the fair value of products and services they buy.   The Administration is deeply committed to expanding access to justice  and believes that no worker, business that wants to compete,  or consumer should have  to give up their access to the courts before  a dispute has arisen.  Not only do these  clauses prevent consumers and workers from having a fair shot at justice, they  also hide companies\u2019 wrongdoing from other consumers who are choosing between products and workers  who are  deciding between jobs.   Eliminating the use  of these clauses would increase incentives for employers to prevent and remedy problems in the workplace  and in their business practices.  The FAIR  Act  would  make great strides to advance worker and consumer rights  and expand access to justice  \u2013  two critical priorities of the Administration.  The Administration looks  forward to working with Congress as the FAIR Act proceeds through the legislative process.   * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 3755, the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act of 2021.  Texas recently enacted  S.B. 8, an extreme law  that  blatantly violates existing Supreme Court precedent established under Roe  v. Wade  nearly half a century  ago.  The Texas law  significantly  impairs  women\u2019s access to critical reproductive health care, particularly  affecting  communities of color, individuals  with low incomes, and those who live in rural or underserved communities.   The law  also  turns private citizens into bounty hunters who are empowered to  bring lawsuits against  anyone  who they believe has helped another person get an abortion, including  family members, faith leaders, those providing transportation,  and  health care  providers.   In the wake of Texas\u2019  unprecedented attack, it has never been more important to codify  this  constitutional right and to strengthen health care  access  for all women, regardless of where they  live.   The Administration looks forward to working with Congress as the  Women\u2019s Health Protection Act advances through the legislative process to ensure  that this bill  codifies and is consistent with the protections  established by  Roe  and subsequent Supreme Court precedent.   The  constitutional rights of women are essential to the health, safety, and progress of our nation.   Our  daughters and granddaughters deserve the same rights that their mothers and grandmothers fought  for  and won\u2014and that a clear majority of the American people support.  We will not allow this country to go backwards on women\u2019s equality.  ** * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 350, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 2022.  The Administration supports efforts to counter domestic terrorism and looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to authorize programs to counter domestic terrorism in a manner appropriate to the existing statutory regimes and constitutional protections, bolster resources to carry out this important work, and enable the legislation to achieve its goal of enhancing the current government-wide response to the evolving threat posed by domestic terrorism.   H.R. 350 would authorize a dedicated domestic terrorism office within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for identifying and analyzing domestic terrorism activity in keeping with existing authorities and would codify in statute the establishment of dedicated offices within the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate and prosecute domestic terrorism. Domestic terrorism has posed a growing threat over the past decade.  FBI Director Wray, among others, has warned about this escalating threat, including in congressional testimony.  For example, in 2017, Director Wray characterized domestic terrorism as a \u201cvery serious\u201d issue and noted that the FBI had approximately 1,000 open domestic terrorism investigations, approximately the same as the number of FBI\u2019s investigations into U.S.-based individuals inspired by foreign terrorist organizations.  In 2018, Director Wray warned that \u201claw enforcement, racial minorities, and the U.S. Government will continue to be significant targets for many domestic extremist movements.\u201d  In 2021, Director Wray stated that the domestic terrorism threat is \u201cmetastasizing across the country.\u201d  In response to the Biden Administration\u2019s direction to produce a comprehensive assessment of domestic terrorism threats, the Intelligence Community and law enforcement concluded in March 2021 that domestic violent extremists \u201cpose an elevated threat to the Homeland.\u201d     In order to address this threat and after conducting a thorough 100-day review, the Administration released the National Strategy.  The Administration has prioritized addressing all forms of terrorism and targeted violence, including hate crimes, and is committed to continuing to enhance the ability of departments and agencies across government to do so, including through focused intelligence reporting, enhanced information sharing, and increased training to relevant law enforcement personnel.    Federal agencies are executing the goals set forth in the National Strategy and sharing comprehensive data on domestic terrorism with Congress and the public.  For example, DOJ earlier this year announced the creation of a new domestic terrorism unit within the Counterterrorism Section of the National Security Division.  The unit will focus on addressing the domestic terrorism threat by working closely with other parts of DOJ, as well as interagency partners.  The purpose of this new unit is to ensure that domestic terrorism-related matters are expertly handled and effectively coordinated across DOJ components and around the country.  The FBI also has an established Domestic Terrorism Operations Section at FBI Headquarters whose mission is overseeing and providing operational support to FBI domestic terrorism investigations nationwide.  This entity provides regular training on domestic terrorism matters to Federal, State, local, Tribal, and foreign law enforcement agencies through FBI field office partnerships, as well as through established entities, such as the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the National Academy.    Likewise, DHS has enhanced its ability to prevent, detect, and respond to threats related to domestic terrorism.  For example, DHS established a domestic terrorism branch within its Office of Intelligence and Analysis dedicated to producing sound, timely intelligence needed to counter domestic terrorism-related threats and launched the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships to provide communities with resources and tools to help prevent individuals from radicalizing to violence.  DHS also prioritized the allocation of resources to assist our partners to prevent, protect against, and respond to domestic terrorism-related threats through the new designation in 2021 of domestic violent extremism as a \u201cNational Priority Area\u201d within DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Grant Program, as well as through support for target hardening and physical security enhancements of non-profit organizations through DHS\u2019s Nonprofit Security Grant Program.  This legislation would establish an interagency task force to analyze white-supremacist infiltration in specific Federal agencies.  The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to include all relevant Federal agencies within the interagency task force\u2019s scope to ensure that Federal employees are deserving of their positions of trust, as described in the National Strategy.    The Administration thanks the bill\u2019s sponsors and looks forward to continued work to incorporate efforts already underway to counter domestic terrorism.   * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports  House  passage  of H.R. 1333, the National Origin-Based  Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants (NO  BAN) Act, which would prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion  in the exercise of the President\u2019s suspension authority  under section 212(f)  of the  Immigration and Nationality Act.  While the Administration believes that certain exercises  of section 212(f)  authority  may be warranted under emergency  circumstances, the prior Administration\u2019s  haphazard misuse of this authority highlights the need for reasonable  constraints.   As the Congress continues its work on this bill, we look forward to continuing to refine  these provisions.  Since taking  office, President Biden  has  issued Proclamations  rescinding  discriminatory bans on entry to the  United States  enacted by the previous  Administration, including,  most notoriously, a ban  on  the entry of individuals from Muslim-majority countries. Those  bans were  a  stain on our national conscience and are inconsistent with our  long history of welcoming people of all  faiths.  The  Administration stands ready to work with the Congress to adopt  a solution that protects against unfair religious discrimination while also ensuring the Executive Branch has the  flexibility necessary to respond to serious threats  to security and public health, and emergent international crises.  The Administration also urges the Congress to reform other aspects of our  immigration system by passing the U.S. Citizenship Act.  The President\u2019s bill includes key provisions from the NO  BAN Act.  Further, the bill would provide a path to citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants, establish a new system to responsibly manage and secure our border, bring long  overdue visa reforms to keep families together and grow our economy, and address the root causes of instability  and unsafe conditions causing migration from Central America.  * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act  of 2021, which would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrant  youth, known as  \u201cDreamers,\u201d as well as  individuals with Temporary  Protected Status (TPS). Americans recognize that our Nation is enriched by  the  contributions of immigrants.  H.R. 6 is a critical milestone  toward much-needed relief for the millions of undocumented individuals who call the United States home.  Dreamers and TPS recipients are over-represented as essential  workers  and are helping to keep our economy  and communities afloat during a  global pandemic.   Yet, these individuals continue to live in a state of precariousness and fear.  Ensuring that  Dreamers and TPS recipients have a clear path to citizenship would deliver much needed economic security  and stability to millions of people who currently face perpetual uncertainty  and vulnerability  as a result of their  immigration  status.  Beyond the swift passage of H.R. 6, the Administration also  urges the Congress to reform other  aspects of  our immigration system by passing the U.S. Citizenship Act, which would provide a  path to citizenship to  millions  of undocumented immigrants, establish a new system to  responsibly manage and secure our border, bring long overdue  visa reforms to  keep families  together and grow our economy, and address the  root causes of instability  and unsafe conditions  causing  migration from Central America.

Women lose thousands of dollars each year, and hundreds of thousands over a lifetime, because of the  gender and racial wage  gap.   Women working full-time, year-round in 2019 earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men working full-time, year-round, and these  disparities are  greater for women of color.  Pay inequity  also impacts individuals who face  intersecting forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including  LGBTQ+ individuals.    Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of women have dropped out of the labor force, partly  reflecting the increased  domestic labor demands on women. Caregiving demands often fall  disproportionately on women, which leads to many  women having to reduce their hours, resulting in lower  earnings.   As more and more  American families rely on women's income, the pay  gap hurts  not only  women, but also the families who depend on them.   The cumulative  impact of wage  gaps adds up to financial insecurity  over the course of a career for women and their families and for generations who follow.     The Paycheck Fairness Act is commonsense legislation that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act and give workers more tools to fight sex-based pay discrimination.   It would also take major  steps toward increasing pay transparency, an essential provision to advance  equality in the  workplace, by  explicitly  protecting  workers from retaliation for simply discussing their  compensation with their colleagues.   The bill would also expand opportunities for workers to receive training on effective negotiation skills.  The bill would also limit an employer\u2019s ability to rely on salary history during the hiring process to set pay, or when determining wages for  a  promotion.   H.R. 7 would hold employers accountable by  closing judicially  created loopholes for  employer defenses and by  adding  a class action option  under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   The bill would require the collection of pay data to enable better enforcement of laws prohibiting pay discrimination.  The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with the Congress to address pay equity  and urges quick action on this landmark bill.   ", "The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R. 1319, the  American Rescue Plan  Act of 2021.  This bill is based on the plan that the President proposed to the Congress in January.  It provides the tools and support critical to meet the moment and tackle  the urgent  public health and economic crises the Nation faces as a result of COVID-19.  The bill provides the funding necessary to support the Administration\u2019s Government-wide  strategy to combat COVID-19. This includes funding to set up community  vaccination sites  nationwide, scale up testing and tracing, eliminate  supply shortage problems, invest in high-quality treatments, address health disparities, and  ensure workplace health  and safety  protections.  The bill also  extends tax credits for employers that provide workers with paid sick and family  leave to contain the spread of the virus.  Because the pandemic has created  unprecedented challenges for students and parents, with families of color disproportionately impacted, the bill provides K-12 schools and institutions of higher learning with the resources  they need to reopen  safely  and stay  open, as well as to address the academic, social and emotional needs of students. The bill also delivers immediate relief to  workers and families bearing the  brunt of the public  health and economic crises. The bill finishes the job of providing Americans with a $2,000 economic impact payment by providing eligible  Americans with a $1,400 payment in addition to the $600 payment provided in December of 2020.  The bill also expands the Child Tax  Credit and Earned  Income Tax  Credit on an emergency  basis, extends key emergency unemployment  benefits, raises the minimum wage to $15 per hour, and stabilizes pensions for Americans who participate in multi-employer pension plans.  To deal with the  acute housing and hunger  crises  caused by the pandemic, the bill provides Americans in need with rental, mortgage, and homelessness assistance and extends the emergency benefit increase in the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).   To  help families cope with child  care challenges  as a result of the pandemic\u2014including the significant reduction in female labor  force participation\u2014 the bill provides relief to hard-hit child  care providers and temporarily increases tax  credits to  help families cover the cost of child  care.   And the bill lowers health  care costs and expands  health  care access during this once-in-a century pandemic by increasing  Affordable Care Act  premium tax credits, providing subsidies for continuation health coverage (COBRA), ensuring  adequate funding for  veterans\u2019 health, and providing critical funding to help address the  unprecedented mental health and substance use consequences of the pandemic.   The bill also  provides critical support to struggling communities and businesses.   For small businesses, the bill includes funding  for the Paycheck Protection Program  (PPP), the Economic  Injury  Disaster  Loan (EIDL) Advance program, the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program, and a program that finances innovative small businesses.  The bill also establishes a new  program to help struggling businesses in the hospitality industry  and a new  Community  Navigator pilot program  to increase awareness of,  and participation in,  COVID-19 small business relief programs.   To help farmers struggling with the effects of the  pandemic, the bill includes funding to address weaknesses in our  agriculture food systems.  In addition, the bill  provides relief for hard-hit public  transportation agencies, as well as  funding to directly support  airline industry  employees.   The bill provides support for  police, firefighters, EMTs,  and other  essential workers through flexible funding for  State, local, and territorial  governments.  Finally, the bill provides  Tribal governments  with critical  support to address  persistent inequities in  COVID-19 transmission, hospitalization, and  death, while improving economic conditions and opportunity.   The bill would allow the Administration to execute its plan to change  the  course of  the COVID-19  pandemic.   And it would  provide Americans and their communities an economic bridge  through the  crisis.  The Administration urges the Congress to act swiftly to pass the bill in order  to deliver  to  American communities the urgent support and relief they need.    * * * * * * *     ", "The Administration strongly supports House  passage of H.R. 4,  the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021  (VRAA).   The right to vote freely, the right to vote fairly, the right to have  your vote counted is fundamental.   In the last election, all told, more than 150 million Americans of every  age, of every race, of every background  exercised their right to vote.  This historic level of participation in the face of a  once-in-a-century pandemic should have been celebrated by everyone.  Instead, some have sought to delegitimize the election  and make it  harder to vote, in many  cases by targeting the methods of voting  that made  it possible for many  voters to participate.  These efforts violate the most basic ideals of America.  Yet another massive  wave of discriminatory action may be imminent as we enter  a new legislative redistricting  cycle.  Unfortunately, incumbents too often cling to power by drawing  district lines to favor their own prospects at the expense of minority  communities, choosing their  voters instead of the other way around.   While anti-voter action undermines democracy  for all Americans, we know that communities of  color often suffer the  worst effects of these measures\u2014and all too often, that is not by  accident.  The sacred right to vote is under attack across the country.  The VRAA  will strengthen  vital legal protections  to ensure that all Americans  have a  fair opportunity to participate in our democracy.  Among other things, it would create  a new framework for allowing  DOJ to review voting changes in jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to ensure that they do not discriminate based on race.  It would also clarify the scope of legal tools designed to challenge discriminatory voting  laws in court, ensuring that the Voting Rights Act offers protection against modern forms of voter suppression.   In an essay published shortly after  he died, Congressman John Lewis wrote, \u201cDemocracy is not a state. It is an act[.]\u201d   This bill not only bears his name, it heeds his call.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress as the VRAA proceeds through the legislative process to ensure that the bill achieves lasting reform consistent with Congress\u2019 broad constitutional authority to protect voting rights and to strengthen our democracy.    * * * * * * *  ", "The Administration supports Senate passage of the  bipartisan amendment in the nature of a  substitute to H.R. 3684, the  Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act.  This legislation represents the most significant  long-term investment in the United States\u2019 infrastructure and competitiveness in nearly a century.  This legislation would  make life better for Americans across the country, create a generation of  good-paying union jobs, grow our economy, invest in communities that have too often been left behind, and better position the United States to compete  globally  and win in the 21st  century.  The United States is the wealthiest country in the  world, yet  the World Economic Forum found that  it ranks 13th  when it comes to the overall quality of our infrastructure.  After decades of underinvestment, the country\u2019s roads, bridges, and water systems are crumbling,  and our  electric  grid is vulnerable to catastrophic outages.  Too many  families lack access to affordable, high-speed internet, clean drinking water, and public transportation.  In the United States, the  transportation sector is the largest contributor to greenhouse  gas emissions and is also one of the  sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate  change.  And, too often, past infrastructure  investments have disproportionately  and negatively  impacted low-income neighborhoods and communities of color.  It has never been more important for us to invest in strengthening our infrastructure and competitiveness, and do so in a way that creates the  good-paying union jobs of the future, addresses long-standing  racial  and economic  injustice, and helps to fight the climate  crisis.  The historic  Infrastructure  Investment and  Jobs Act would  make an array of transformational investments in our country\u2019s infrastructure.  It  would  support modernization  and expansion of  rail networks across the country and make the largest Federal investment in public transit in history.  The  legislation would  provide resources to repair and rebuild our  roads and bridges with a focus on climate  change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for  all users, including  cyclists and pedestrians.  It would also make critical investments in ports and airports to modernize facilities and reduce bottlenecks.  In addition, the  Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act would  begin to eliminate the  Nation\u2019s lead service lines and pipes, delivering  clean drinking  water to up to ten million American families and more than 400,000 schools and child care  facilities that currently do  not  have it, including in Tribal nations and disadvantaged communities.  And, recognizing that broadband access and digital inclusion  are  critical for    Americans to fully  participate in modern society, the  Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act would  help connect every  American to reliable high-speed internet, building on the billions of dollars for broadband deployment in the American Rescue Plan  Act of 2021.  It would  also help lower prices for internet service  and help close the digital divide, so that more Americans can afford internet access.   The  Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act is also  a critical down payment to help address the  climate emergency.  It would  support the development of  a network of electric vehicle  chargers along highways and in rural and disadvantaged communities and electrify thousands of school and transit buses across the country.  In addition, the  legislation would  provide investments to upgrade our power infrastructure, including by building thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy.  It  would  also make the largest investment in addressing  legacy pollution in American history.    Finally, the legislation would  make our infrastructure more resilient against the impacts of  climate change, cyber-attacks, and extreme weather events,  including by making  critical resources available to state, local, tribal, and territorial communities  to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural disasters and  cybersecurity incidents.   The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on this legislation, which represents a major step in achieving the President\u2019s Build Back  Better agenda.   * * * * * * *     ", " ", "The Administration supports passage of  H.R. 6833, the Affordable  Insulin Now Act, to cap  the out-of-pocket  cost for one month\u2019s supply of insulin at $35 or less.  This  legislation  will help  ensure that this life-saving medication is affordable for  millions of  Americans with diabetes  who  take insulin and their families. Insulin was discovered nearly 100 years ago and costs less than $10 a vial to manufacture, yet  there are still American  families with insurance  paying  hundreds of dollars  a vial.   The Affordable  Insulin Now  Act would mean  nearly all  Americans with  private health insurance  or covered by Medicare do not have to spend thousands of dollars  for this essential medication.   American  families  deserve peace of  mind  knowing their insulin costs will not  skyrocket when they or  their loved ones change insurance, and no family should be forced to choose between buying insulin and putting food on the table or paying other bills.  Combined with this Administration\u2019s efforts to ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable  health coverage, this bill will help combat the rapidly rising  out-of-pocket  cost of insulin and put  money back in the hands  of American families.  Additional reforms are needed to continue to lower the cost of prescription drugs.  America  pays  more than any other developed country for prescription drugs, and as many as one in four  Americans struggle to afford their prescription drugs.  The  Administration looks forward to working  with Congress on additional legislation that will let Medicare  negotiate the cost of  prescription drugs, require rebates when prescription drug prices increase faster than inflation, establish an out-of-pocket cap in Medicare Part D, and implement other important changes to bring relief to struggling  American patients and their  families.  The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to enact this legislation and to  reduce the cost of prescription drugs.  * * * * * * *  "]}}
