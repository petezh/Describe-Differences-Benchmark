We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.", "Regular Check-In Post Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing.

I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.\n\nSo just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. \n\nAt that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. \n\nAnd even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours than ours, then escalates into a more \"This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel\" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. \n\nThanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed.", "I went to the hospital because I was having really bad panic attacks, and theycontinued in there. I ended up collapsing and the nurse who was trying to help me up said, \"You're attention seeking.\". I literally broke down crying and asked to go home, another nurse was watching me while I was crying saying he wanted to keep me longer, as I kept saying I wanted to go home and He said I was \"wasting his time\" by making him watch over me while I asked to cry for a while before leaving. I've never been through anything like this especially when in a hospital and when I was so weak and my chest and throat hurting so much from a panic attack. I just wanted to vent, thank you for reading.", "Cake day for me Any kind soul want to give a depressed person karma.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone and especially from this sub. I hope we all overcome depression some day and take it easy everyone.", "sorry but why the fuck is life like this literally though. have i done anything wrong", "I hate love why does it hurt so much? Why can\u2019t I be happy without it? There\u2019s this empty void in my heart that gets bigger everyday. I\u2019m just waiting until it eats me up, since I\u2019ll never have 2 sided love.", "This world has no place for people like me. A bit of context. I'm an American. I'm black. I'm big. I'm ugly. And I'm autistic. I work as an aircraft mechanic.\n\nThe more I go through every day, the less I see the point of continuing with this life. No one who's gotten to know me as a person wants anything to do with me. People make fun of my quirks all the time - they think they're being funny, but they're being obnoxious. Besides that, the only friends I still have are the ones in high school, who are now so far away. My father, the man who cared about me more than anyone else did, passed away a few years ago from sudden heart and kidney failure, while I was waiting on a connecting flight to visit him.\n\nBesides that, people will only connect with me as much as they need to. I clearly have problems that I do not know how to address. No amount of therapy has fixed those issues.\n\nPeople cross the street when they see me on the sidewalk. Society here in general doesn't like people like me, with so many people supporting an openly racist president as we regress. I know that I won't ever be able to rely on the cops for anything, because I'm likely to get shot before they figure out what the issue is. I've been racially profiled many times when I lived in New York City. I happened to be stopped for every \"random\" drug search whenever I took the Staten Island ferry while carrying a backpack.\n\nThat being the case, the only value of any sort I can provide to society is in the job I do. I'm also doing vocational training for a higher qualification, but every day I'm questioning more and more why I care. More money isn't going to fix me as a person.\n\nThe truth is, I'm a mistake. I learned a few years ago that I was adopted at birth. Probably before my new parents knew I would be as difficult as I was. I should've been aborted or left to die.\n\nThe prognosis for our world grows more dire every day due to global warming facilitated by old people who don't give a shit about us. There is no reason to believe things will get better - people reject science more and more, and we are going backwards.\n\nBefore long, I will have a gun. It will allow me to protect myself where I know law enforcement won't. But it'll also give me the power to choose when I want to die. That, at the very least, will give me peace of mind - knowing I have a way out whenever I need it.\n\nI'm not some \"starving kid in Africa\" or whatever other bullshit people push to those who are discontented, but I have still been dealt a pretty shitty hand in life. I see no reason to keep bothering with it when so many things are wrong with me, and our future will only get worse.", "I\u2019m not even worthy of being counted during attendance. I go to a small school, normally no more than 20 students are in a classroom, yet my teachers don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m in their class most of the time. I have amazing teachers, and they always want to help students learn, but I\u2019m always forgotten about. I\u2019m not slow enough to need special help, I\u2019m not smart enough to need no help though. I\u2019m pretty quiet, and I almost always get interrupted by loud people. If I actually work up the nerve to ask a question in my asshole-filled classes, the teacher gets distracted by two idiots trying to kill each other and forgets about me. \n\nI know I probably sound like a spoiled child that just wants attention, but I don\u2019t. All I want is to not be forgotten, to not be interrupted, to not be counted absent in a class when I\u2019m always there.", "8 years ago, I posted here, wanting to die. My life is so much better now. When I was 15-16 years old, I posted here in my darkest moments. I couldn't see any reason to keep living. I thought I was nothing special and the next 8 years seemed like an endless slog. You can look through my post history if you want. \n\nSince then, I graduated college and graduate school. I have traveled the world. I swam with bioluminescent algae in Indonesia. I've hiked among alpacas in Peru. I learned to speak Spanish fluently and connected with people around the world and in my own country, who speak Spanish too. I've published my writing i  multiple publications. I have fallen in love and had my heart broken several times. I realized I'm gay, came out, and I'm with the most amazing woman. I have a career that I love where I help people every day. I can honestly say that depression may be a lifelong struggle for me, but it is possible to recover and develop tools to cope with it. Every day is a manageable challenge now. Every day I am grateful to just be alive. I am SO GLAD that I didn't kill myself 8 years ago. I never would have known how beautiful my life could become.\n\nBefore you think about killing yourself, remember that you don't know how beautiful your life could become. How could you? You have no way of knowing until you get there. But you need to be alive.", "Thank you reddit I just fucking hate my life but have to keep fucking acting like everythings fucking fone and happy i cant bring myself to fucking tell anyone how depressed i am but i can post it here and tell you guys, you are my only escape from reality and the only thing that makes me feel less lonely", "I'm tired of caring about other people, but no one caring about me. Seems like when anyone else in my life is feeling down, I drop everything to help. But when I'm feeling down, I get ignored. Maybe I'm overreacting, but sometimes I just want to feel loved even when I'm depressed.", "I just can't fathom why no one loves me My friends hype me up so much, and God love 'em for it, but there's just this enormous disconnect between how valuable they I say I am, and the level of value I feel and witness from potential dates and love interests. I don't know why it has to be this way. I don't know why I should be so painfully alone, and feel so unlovable.", "Can I leave some baggage here Im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. Apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, im on mobile and im lost. Not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc.\nOkay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.\nI was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a \"happy\" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to \"protect\" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted \"who I was\" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming \"DONT TOUCH ME GERM\" \"GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF\" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) \"You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak\". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me \"mysteriouslyreddited\". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell \"get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!\". I replied with \"well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are\" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and \"ignored\" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release.

Anger, hate, always stems from fear, and pain.\n\nBehind every tyrant is a hurt child. Behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard, a\n\nheart that was once broken, eyes that were once blinded. The tyrant doesn\u2019t want you to\n\nsee the light, because the light was once taken from him, he doesn\u2019t want you to know love,\n\nbecause love was once taken from him, and he wants you to hurt, because he hurts.\n\nBut how can tyranny be defeated? When tyranny is defeated by force, it often just paves\n\nthe way for another form of tyranny. You don\u2019t want to kill your tyrant, you\u2019ll be left with\n\nblood on your hands and trauma in your soul, if you kill you\u2019ll have to hide, and what is the\n\npoint of fighting your way out of the darkness, just to make your way into another form of\n\ndarkness?\n\nNo. Your tyrant won\u2019t be defeated by force. He will be defeated by love, and I know that\n\nyour love is strong enough to turn him around.\n\nThe man that I love finds joy in the little things, the touch of the grass against his feet, the\n\nsight of birds in the trees, the sound of a stick falling on icy water. The man that I love is\n\nsurprising, he is unapologetically original, passionate, and doted of a natural humour. The\n\nman that I love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone around\n\nhim feel seen, heard, and loved. The man that I love is wise, he can offer advice that you\n\nnever knew you needed, and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyone\u2019s day. The man that I\n\nlove will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care and\n\nattention. The man that I love, can love so strongly, so unconditionally, so powerfully, that\n\nhe can make anyone\u2019s darkness fade away. So, if anyone is going to bring this tyrant down,\n\nit will be the man that I love.\n\nLove can make your tyrant feel seen, it can make him feel comfortable enough to talk,\n\ncomfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny. When faced with love,\n\nwith a powerful, unconditional love, and an acceptance that is free of all judgment, your\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions, he will be able to start realising that all\n\nalong he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you, they were\n\nnever your fault, he was only causing you to suffer, because he was suffering. When that\n\nrealisation will spring upon him, he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you are\n\nfacing yourself. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you, he\n\nwon\u2019t wish to do that anymore though, he\u2019ll unchain you and remove his mask, and you will\n\nrealise that all along, your tyrant was only a child. Suddenly the anger you felt towards your\n\ntyrant will vanish, because you are a man who is fair, just and loving, you are a man who\n\ndoesn\u2019t believe in punishment nor revenge, you are a man who can forgive. You are a man\n\nwho can recognise when a child simply needs to be held, loved and nurtured.\n\nSo you will take the child\u2019s hand. At first, he will be fearful, he has been hurt before, who\u2019s\n\nto say that you won\u2019t hurt him? But you will give him your word, you will promise him that\n\nhe is safe with you, and deep in your heart, you will know that you are telling the truth. The\n\nchild will weep in your arms, and you will hold him tighter, you will tell him that he is loved,\n\nhe is heard, he is seen, and that from this moment forward, he will never be alone.\n\nYou will come out of the basement with the child, hand in hand. And although at first it will\n\nfeel like a relief, it won\u2019t be easy. You haven\u2019t seen the sun in so long, its light will feel\n\nblinding and uncomfortable, your body will still feel weak, and as you\u2019ll barely feel able to\n\nlook after yourself, you\u2019ll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child? But\n\nyou will surprise yourself. Through the small pleasures you once enjoyed, such as feeling the\n\ncool grass underneath your feet, you will find strength. Enough strength to lift yourself up,\n\ncarry the child, and start walking. It will be challenging, and you\u2019ll worry that each step\n\nmight be your last step, you\u2019ll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to get\n\nback up, but you\u2019ll keep putting a foot in front of the other, until it starts to feel natural.\n\nEventually you\u2019ll look up and realise that the sun isn\u2019t as blinding as it was when you first\n\ncame out, you\u2019ll see a path, and you\u2019ll know how to get home.\n\nOn your way home, you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of a\n\nburden for me. What if I don\u2019t want him? What if I don\u2019t love him? After all he was once a\n\ntyrant, how could I love him? And what if I don\u2019t even love you anymore? You\u2019ve been gone\n\nfor so long, what if I\u2019ve stopped waiting? What if I\u2019ve given up? What if I\u2019ve found someone\n\nelse? What if I just end up hurting you and the child more than you\u2019ve both already been\n\nhurt?\n\nBut all this time, I\u2019ve been waiting for you. I\u2019ve been worrying, I\u2019ve been crying, you\n\ndisappeared so suddenly I never understood what had happened. I made it my mission to\n\nfind you, I was up day and night trying to save you, I called on you a thousand times, I\n\nsearched for clues in every corner, I even tried to negotiate with your tyrant, but to no avail,\n\nit only angered him more. I tried to get help, but no one could help me, and in the end, I was\n\nleft weakened. That\u2019s when I realised that I was exhausting myself, and I wasn\u2019t helping you.\n\nSo I did the only thing I could do. I stopped trying to save you and trusted that you would be\n\nable to save yourself, and as I waited for you to do that, I held our space, I nourished our\n\nspace so that you could come back to a loving and nurturing home, one where you could\n\none day feel whole again and heal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you come home, I will welcome your little boy with open arms, and love him, just as I\n\nlearned to love the little girl who once held me hostage in a basement. The truth is I already\n\nknow your little boy, I\u2019ve seen him in your shadows, and I\u2019ve already grown to love him. You\n\nalso know my little girl, she has been living in our home throughout our entire relationship.\n\nShe has loved you as much as I have, and although at first she was afraid of you, she was\n\nafraid that you would hurt her, she grew to love you, and she learned to trust you. When\n\nyou were gone for so long, she began to worry, she worried that perhaps you would never\n\ncome back, she worried that perhaps you didn\u2019t want to come back to us, perhaps you\n\nwanted another home, a different home, perhaps you had stopped loving us.\n\nBut I reassured her, and I told her about the love that we shared, the hours and days we\n\nspent looking into each other\u2019s eyes, as time stood still and the world around us vanished,\n\nand we questioned, every day, how we could be so lucky. Our love is the truest love I\u2019ve\n\never known, our love is the deepest love I\u2019ve ever known, and I know that a love like ours,\n\nnever just goes away.\n\nOne day my little girl will meet your little boy, and they will love each other as much as we\n\nlove each other, the four of us will build a home so whole, that all our fears will be replaced\n\nby trust, our anger will be replaced by love, and tyranny will be nothing but a distant\n\nmemory.\n\nThis isn\u2019t going to happen overnight, we don\u2019t want you to exhaust yourself trying to come\n\nhome, we don\u2019t want you to run and fall, we want you to make wise and calculated steps, so\n\nthat you can slowly but surely come back to us.\n\nIf I could, I would be in the basement with you, but you don\u2019t want me there, and if I force\n\nmyself into the basement, my little girl will turn into a tyrant again and our home will\n\ncollapse. So although I\u2019m not in the darkness with you, know that I can still see you, and I\n\nam still here, holding our fort, waiting for you to find the strength to love your tyrant\n\nunconditionally, so that you can bring him home for us to nurture and heal him, so that he\n\ncan learn to fearlessly trust both of us.", "Suicidal thoughts - multiple times a day It's not a competition, I'm not promoting it, but I've had one of the worst 24 hours where I've been knocked down, felt suicidial, picked myself back up, got knocked down again, felt suicidal again, picked myself back up again, and then it's happened all again.

Even before that, I didn't receive a high school education as I spent it all, you guessed it, in my house.\n\nThere was a small portion in my life where I actually had friends, 10 years ago, I was active, \"fun\", enjoying my life fairly well but occasionally I was still in the dumps.

My programming professor understood and gave me the slip to go back to do the labs and hwks that I missed.

Or is it just because I long such relationship potrayed in it as a pedophile? Or both?\n\nThe last 3 days I wasnt able to function properly at work.. \n\nAny idea to shake it off my head?", "I'm Lost I feel the only thing that makes me even remotely content these days is when I convince myself when and how I'm going to kill myself.

Because I'm not actually a risk to myself,  I'm not in any way planning any attempt but as I fall asleep it seems like I'm always thinking about how an exit wound would look at the back of my head.  \n\n\nI call passive suicidality 'living in the Grey'. It's an inbetween state,  smack bang in the middle of loving life and hating it.  It's so strange because health professionals are always asking if I'm having 'dark thoughts' and it's like,  well,  what really *is* a dark thought? When it comes down to it,  it's the behaviour, the intention, not the thoughts,  that are the true issue.  \n\nDeath is always on my mind.  Not just my own,  but anyone and everyone.  I think constantly about different situations where people in my life die tragically,  and how I would grieve.

I wonder how many days, or how much time it's stolen and continuing to steal from my life?\n\nDo I get to suffer for decades and then die early too, maybe when it's just starting to be light. I'm really not sure. It sucks having problems that damage your mind thrust into your life that are beyond your control. I was pretty normal, and I don't know I'll ever get close to it again.

I've sat on my ass and done practically nothing for the past 2 years, got withdrawn at 15 from school due to mom worried that I'd get bullied for being trans, tried homeschooling but fell out of it.

I just feel no need to...\n\nI'm a joke, and one with a mediocre punchline too. Somebody respectable would have done SOMETHING by now, I've been emotionally abused by my stepfather for a few years but I got over it, so I really can't use that reason or excuse. I could have had a job, had a license and be in college right now, but I can't. Because I lack any motivation, because I don't want my license to say \"male\" or my dead name, because I don't want to be discriminated or humiliated at any public workplaces for being trans, maybe if I wasn't such a lazy pussy, I could have gotten somewhere. \n\nBut nah, I haven't, and it's all because of laziness, lack of motivation, and fear. 6 months to recover? Fair enough, a year? Maybe if it's that serious, but 2 years? Sigh...

MtF I thought I escaped the depression. From the first dose of my Spiro and Estrogen I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. It was time to be myself and thrive. I enjoyed it. I no longer needed to hide. After a couple of months I thought I'd try dating. Of course, I expected the hate messages. I expected the slurs. What I never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after I disclosed that I'm transgender. What I soon found was a pattern. A pattern I could not escape. It was in this moment I realized what being a living fetish is like. \n\nFor the past nine months I've been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a discreet fun time. I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered. Having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. \n\nI want nothing more than to just connect with someone. Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost. I've made a few trans friends and the story is the same. Doesn't matter how pretty. How much they pass. We're just a fetish and nothing more.

I felt so lonely, painfully lonely, and I started hating on myself. I\u2019ve learned to really love myself the past few years but lastnight my dark side emerged and I wanted to hurt myself.

My dad made a clear that he changed for the better and he wasn't gonna be a deadbeat anymore. This arrangement only lasted for about a year and a half, however, because my dad recently moved out two weeks ago.\n\nMy dad leaving again hurt a lot because I felt like I didn't build enough of a relationship with him.

Whenever I'm about to go to sleep, I take my pink mp3 player to my bed and listen to my favorite songs for hours while imagining myself as a skydiver, princess or a superhero! As I dive into the blue sky I scream so loud that my throat hurts. Maybe if I'm loud enough I won't be able to hear my mother's epileptic seizure as the nice paramedic asks me what I've been reading and if school is going good. I try to ignore my grandma crying while my grandfather just looks away from what is happening. School is going good, I'm really enjoying my art classes. The teacher says that I have some potential and that I'm a pleasure to have in class. Maybe because I rarely talk. I like when my teacher praises me, it makes me feel like I'm special - I think as I sit on my bed, with one of my CDs playing in the background.\n\nI'm in middle school. I live in the city now. My school is bigger, more modern and it even has a cafeteria. It's always crowded yet somehow empty at the same time. I no longer have art classes. My teachers say that I'm smart but kind of lazy. All of the girls are so pretty. My cheeks are chubbier than theirs, my legs are thicker and my belly is sticking out. I skip my lunch. Looking at pictures of gorgeous and thin girls on the internet makes me feel full. I hate PE classes. I'm the only girl that can't play volleyball. I hit the ball really hard and now my hoodie is stained red. It hurts but I pretend nothing has happened. Nobody notices. \n\nHigh school is scary. Boys don't really like me. Maybe because of the way I dress or because I cut my hair very short. Starving becomes binging. I really hate my thighs. I'm the class clown. I skip school every day for a week. I overdose on medication several times. One time I almost fall down the stairs and pass out in my bathtub after overdosing on some pills. I try to kill myself. When in the ER one of my teachers is there. She looks at me. I can barely stay awake. One of the nurses tells me that I'm selfish. After coming back from hospital my teachers say that I'm the laziest student they've ever had. My mother forces me to lie so they won't put me in a psychiatric facility. I go to the psychiatrist once and never go back. Now my grandma sleeps in my room and they look through my stuff every day. I have to ask to go to the bathroom. My mom makes me stay in the guest room with only a bed, a desk and my textbooks. Dinner tastes awful. I want to die. \n\nCollege starts. My major is not that great. I have literature classes. I'm a very average student. Sometimes I remember my elementary school art teacher. I feel like I failed her. Boys still don't like me. My cheeks are still way too chubby. My body is covered in white thick lines. People stare a lot. Some ask questions some just avoid me. I still imagine and fantasize before going to sleep a lot. Skydiving turned into jumping off a bridge into a river, grand parties and colorful dresses turned into lonely college dorms, oversized t-shirts, and old sweaters, I no longer am a superhero, now I'm the one waiting for someone or something to save me.

She has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she doesn't care. One of my friends who I thought was my friend leaked out that I'm autistic and have ADHD as well as I take medications for that every day. Now, whenever I walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. Some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. I've been called a mistake so many times. All this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. This has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. I've been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. Everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me. Nothing other than my mom, my dog, and my little brother give me a genuine source of happiness. The people at my school have made me feel even more worthless than I was before this.

Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being \"lazy\", and \"not being able to get it together\", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. \ud83e\udd74  \nAnyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:\n\n1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  \n2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of \"sleep through\" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  \n3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  \n4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  \n5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  \n6) i have never missed a day of therapy  \n7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour\n\nI think that's about it. I do feel better. Will update on my progress.", "Every once in a while I remember I'm useless I feel like there are only three things that you absolutely cannot be, dumb, ugly, and useless. I've gotten through life fairly well being able to somewhat accept the dumb and ugly part, I tried to blame it on other factors for a while but they're just an integral part of who I am. What I can't get passed is being useless and having no skill whatsoever. I fall into all three categories and wish that I had just given up on life sooner.", "I just feel lost and directionless. It's nearly midnight where I am. I'm sitting in my bed, unable to sleep, and hitting a burnt vape. I have no job, no money, no passion or motivation, no coping mechanisms, and generally no happiness. I feel absolutely lost. I just wish I had some sort of purpose, but I just don't. I do nothing almost everyday, but have too much anxiety to do much else. I don't understand how people can get out of bed everyday and just do SOMETHING. I don't have motivation to really LIVE, but I continue existing for a reason I don't even know. All of my friends are depressed and feel generally lost too. But they have jobs and get shit done. And I just don't. I feel like a ship just dead at sea. I don't want to die, but just want to escape.", "My parents always thought I was lazy as the title states my parents always thought I was lazy in my highschool days, but I was just unbelievably depressed. Can anyone else relate? \n\nwas I lazy at times? Hell yea brother but isn\u2019t everyone at some point? They\u2019d call me lazy if I hung out in my bedroom, didn\u2019t shower, ect went on for all my highschool days even when I was on a football team my whole highschool life never came home till 6 and was gone Friday/Saturday nights out with friends, cleaned up as much as a teenager does. \n\nMy point being why didn\u2019t my parents ever sit me down and talk to me and explain it? I remember having tears coming down my face as 14 year old me held a knife in the kitchen as my step dad walked towards the laundry room I had a sigh of relief that someone would help but he didn\u2019t mention it or see me or talk to me. I feel like if they would\u2019ve just sat me down after seeing these signs they\u2019d know and I\u2019d be way better developed then I am now cause I\u2019m just learning these things now. I had no idea it was even depression I thought something was wrong with me, still do till this day. They determined I was the quiet one and didn\u2019t like to talk much but up until highschool I never had that problem, I felt like I got sunk into a depression and never really came out of it and now I\u2019m stuck being profiled as this guy I\u2019m not, even when I speak I get spoken over like it\u2019s a primal thing or them trying to shun my words? \n\nI don\u2019t want people to think my parents where bad they were great but I just don\u2019t understand it at all.

Then I decided to post it on here. \n\nJust moved to a new city and started at a new school. I don't miss anything from my old hometown, I'm actually quite happy to be somewhere else. Moving has been tough though. I had to give up my cat and say goodbye to my friends.\n\nI have kind of 'joined' a group of friends at school. They're all pretty nice. The dynamic of the group is a little weird though. Its like 50% introverts who don't talk much, myself included, and 50% strongly opinionated extroverts. They mostly seem like a nice group of people though. In regard to making friends, things have gone pretty well. Trying to form deep relationships with people is a hard and long process though. It's hard not to get impatient and blame myself though. I feel like I'm being ungrateful because even though I think I've been lucky in finding a group of friends, which is exactly what I want, I still feel so shit.\n\nI've never been diagnosed but I think I could have depression and/or anxiety. I would love to get some medication if it would ease the pain, but I don't want to tell my parents how I feel.\n\nOver the past few years I've thought of suicide probably at least once a month, usually weekly or daily though, and planned it two or three times in my life. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. I've been researching pills I can get at a chemist that I could overdose on and I've found a suicide bridge that's very close to my house. I've been told that I should live for all the good moments in life, but the effort it takes to reach those moments doesn't seem worth it sometimes.\n\nI'm starting to find it hard to trust myself. I'm like a different person from day to day, or even hour to hour. During the brief moments when I feel happy about something I worry about my emotions causing me to do something I regret. When I'm sad or empty it's all I can think about.\n\nThere's this girl who's not in my new social circle but who has been really nice to me. She seems like a really nice person. We don't see each other much but she always makes an effort to greet me. I'm unsure whether her intentions are romantic or platonic and it's making me dizzy. I really want us to become better friends or maybe more, but I am not great at social interaction and always make myself feel shit about every little mistake I make. I feel kind of like It'll never happen, yet I spent the whole afternoon texting her. I feel like I'm going insane.\n\nThe people I admire most are the ones that seem like the nicest people you could ever know and make you feel happy just being present or after a short conversation and you're always left wanting more from them. I aspire to be like this and make other people happy. I need to remember to smile more though.\n\nUsually I have a high libido but the past two weeks my drive has literally been non-existent. A month ago my shit suddenly became sloppy even though my diet is quite healthy and hasn't changed much, I think it is anxiety causing me to be extremely tense all the time. I just started waking up at 4am every morning out of nowhere and I can't stop. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.\n\nI feel so lonely. I just want someone to talk to and listen to. Getting to that point with someone new takes time and I'm getting kind of impatient.\n\nI don't know what to do to make myself happy. If things worked out with this girl I think I would be happier, yet the thought of her losing interest in me makes me feel awful.\n\nWow, this ended up really long.", "I hate therapists I tried going to a therapist and after they listen to you instead of saying anything good they tell you dumb shit like write down your feelings in a journal every day, like what the fuck I feel like shit every day!\n\nEdit: I am not saying I expect some magic word or crap like that and it\u2019ll all be better, I just thought there was some better advice for stuff I could do to stop feeling like shit all the time.", "Missing the sadness I suffered with depression for many years, and haven recently reached a turning point in my life where I finally feel good again, but somethings a little off, all my emotions are less extreme, sadness passes in minutes now and is nowhere near the intensity is was before, but I feel this weird longing to feel an emotion to that same depth and extreme again, has anyone else experienced this?

Unfortunately for me every door, every option, every opertunity has been closed off for me since I was born. \nBefore I say what I came here to ask here's alittle backstory...\n\nBackstory - throughout my mom's pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure I was to be born a healthy baby girl, but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and I came out not only a boy (according to what I've been told and what's written on my birth certificate) I was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip, cleft palette, asthma, droopy eyes(don't know if that's the clinical term, but basically up until I was 8 or 10 [can't remember] I was unable to open my eyes all the way), and various other problems. I have always felt like I should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks (another failed diagnosis, lucky me right?). \n\nMy childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all I wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldn't even be born right. Since my conciousness first made its way into this world I have found myself thinking as a girl, along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if I managed to get it right. My dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own, but of course I was informed my dad had the chance to come to America when I was born because of my condition, but he declined to start a new family and I'm sure he had other reasons. My mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time. An older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how I talked and how I acted. My brother constantly calling me gay, faggot, bitch, you name it he's done it. I'm sure he was unaware of how I felt inside but it traumatized me so much I am afraid of being myself. My body is not shaped how normal guy's are either so I have no idea how to take that problem. At school o was labeled the retarded kid no one liked.\n\nOnce I turned 11 my mom met a man, let's call him D. D was/is military and I later found out they got married quick (span of a few months) to finance my surgeries because I came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids (later 3). I was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments. I was always forced to do everything for everybody else. My brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed, I had to do it, stuff like that. To this day I get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they \"don't know how\". I have always been used all my life. I am nothing but a tool. As I patiently waited for the surgeries that I was supposed to get (atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal) when I was 12, then delayed to 16, then 18, and finally at 19. I received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell. \n\nMedical history - The doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose, for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side [which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest] is fat which I didn't even care about having in the first place I just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later. I was put in a maxillary distractor (fancy name for cage on my head). To move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate (roof of my mouth) and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing I have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me. It did however improve my speech just a tiny bit. I had to wear this crap o. My head for 4 months. Later I then made my own appointments 2 years later (22) and got a surgery for bonegraft. I am still missing the tooth implant which I cannot afford nor will I ever be able to, and I have to have another surgery on my nose again. I have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances. (Also I have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either I've got something going on down there that shouldn't be or when I was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boy).\n\nAs for the other reasons why I'm highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing. I was forced by my stepdad to go into debt. I wanted to go to college but I wanted to do it like everyone else, a real place surrounded by real people so I can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer. Of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use. I agree and then he turns and days \"yea no... Do it yourself\". Landing me 16k debt that I can't pay, 3k I was forced to pay (just to get my diploma) and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes. Before this though I was planning to join the military to get a one up on life, but apparently not God's plan. Since when I brought up the idea he straight refused. I was not allowed to work or go out, I did not have an allowance or any type of money except money I got for my birthday ($20 every year, ages 18-19-20) and it didn't help that I had no friends up until senior year in highschool (that summer is the only happy memories I have after leaving my home town. He was very controlling that's why I feel I can't do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma I've faced.\n\nI did however keep the promis I made to myself about joining the military. Unfortunately though I was not let in. After two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork I was finally sent to MEPS for the Marines, finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head. NOPE! Once I get there I take the ASVAP and score on the higher side (I know right smarts actually came in handy I might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side) scored 80. Go through medical everything good up until the physical, the doctor asks me if I always been tall and skinny (I have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis) I say yes, normal ok cool then I go to the eye exam and they tell me I have astigmatism in my left eye (this I knew it happened when I was about 5 or so, started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail) I went to see if I can get this fixed they said and I quote \"the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress, the best solution I can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time, sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time.\" - Lasik doctor. So dream job at Marines = no go. The MEPS people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone. I do and same thing they say I can't join because of my stupid eye, gee thanks God. \n\nAt this point I start thinking maybe it's not meant to be and give up. \n\nMy job history is halarious, atleast to me. Almost even didn't get hired. First job at age 20, McDonald's. Mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world, who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis (he thought it was so curved he can't have sex yet he never tried, now he's depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up, doctor also gave him circomsition) this happened during my attempt at joining the Marines. Throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how God hates him, this is punishment, lash out at me for no reason, and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation. Once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause it's not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways. Because of the move I am forced to quit my job that I actually enjoyed, to transfer to another McDonald's on the side of town we moved to (two towns down) I work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly I was being treated, everything was my fault, I never did anything right, I was lazy, the works (even though I did mainly everybody's job in the kitchen, everyday I washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day, I would be on grill then on the table making the burgers, I'd go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer. You name it I did it.) I eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to California and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying I left and he tried to stop me... I was sick of his shit. I had shit I was dealing with all my life and now I have to deal with you and your problem too, (excuse the langauge but) fuck outta here with that shit. \nI have so little control over my own life that I only spent 2 days in California before my mom told the entire family where I was and got my aunt (grandma's sister so technically grandma, who's also a nun) to somehow convince me to go to New York and stay with my uncle. I can't believe I actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days I was off to NYC. I told myself it's probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican. Wrong. I was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people. Greedy money hungry aunt, no jobs, no money, an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day, wierd daughter that turned into her mother. I had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while I wasn't there to find proof I could pay her $700 to stay in the shitty, stinky room they kept rabbits in. With a door that locks from the outside and a broken window, very small room at that. After two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously I am being called a liar I good for nothing a lazy bum you name it that's what she labeled me. I manage to get a job at McDonald's again but in NY. I manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless. I go back to work and then move into my grandpa's room he was renting. Lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months. Durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little I had. 4 months pass and after much consideration and mom/brother begging for me to come back I oblige. \nI then get a job at another McDonald's in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss. I work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia I was experiencing due to smoking too much (the parinoia was about how I hid the fact I'm not normal and that I wish to be a girl and intricate details of my life).\n\nIf you think that's it well your wrong... My aunt comes to the USA on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe, according to her. My mom is the only one in the USA she knows, mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being, money my mom didn't have, which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such. She stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here, everything is far and you have to drive everywhere. The time that she was here I could have used to work on my music the 3 hours I was left alone in the house, but no. \nEverything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says it's for someone else, complains she didn't buy anything for herself and how she had to use my mom's clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly. She then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her. After I go through the trouble of finding and iPhone 7 plus for a crazy deal ($150) which they usually go for 300-350 I go and I borrow money to go get her the phone. She then says oh... I wanted a more modern one....like yours.... I'm like ugh ok I reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 (my phone was iPhone X pristine condition). Months pass I still don't have a job (stopped looking to focus on getting my licence), everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me, and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so I can't use it, and he also decided to retract the offer before I got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesn't want to pay for it. He is not rich but wealthy $40k in the bank meanwhile I'm 30k in debt 12 of which collectors are being sent now. \n\nDebt - borrowed money I didn't have to help pay bills to not be called worthless and useless. Borrowed too much then took 5k out and ran away to California\n\nThat brings me to the present day, some details have been left out as to not make this extreamly long.\n(Side note: I have always liked girls but it's more like an admiration/envy type of thing, always wishing I was one cause I always felt just wrong in my own body)\n\nOk TL;DR shit life should have been born a girl, instead I came out with so many problems and mental issues along with the traumatizing circumstances I was put in and the problems still continue.", "I hate my life I hate my life so much I would be better off dead I feel, everyday is the same and nothing in life gets better, and the few friends I have seen to not like me anymore, a lot of them don\u2019t talk to me at all and my school friends seem like they don\u2019t like me anymore and I found out a lot of them talking shit about me that I thought were my friends, and I already got bullied for half the year. \n\nI don\u2019t wanna live anymore, and I can\u2019t even see a doctor even though I have the legal right to one there is none available and walk in clinics are useless.

Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD.

It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly.

I tried so hard to be there for him but I eventually gave up when he forced me to leave him because he knew I would be better off without him. \n\nNow I\u2019m with my current boyfriend, who has been amazing and my rock, but he just revealed that his cuts are actually his own doing. I\u2019ve only seen it twice. He\u2019s a normal happy guy with some family troubles, sometimes financial but he handles things rather well and optimistically. It\u2019s hard to gauge him at times because he\u2019s generally a happy guy but he breaks down easily when things start to pile on, understandably so. He is nowhere near how I would describe someone who is depressed, but now I\u2019m not so sure because of the SH. \nCan someone help me understand what he might be going through? Should I be worrying for his life? I\u2019m heartbroken because I hate seeing this pain he\u2019s going through. I thought it was something I wouldn\u2019t have to go through again, it was hard going through it in the past. I feel selfish for feeling like this, I feel almost upset that this is happening.

As an individual who is friends with or have family members that suffer from depression, Ive always wondered, what is something that can help depression that a therapist is lacking? From my personal experience, Ive always heard that having a therapist to treat your depression can be helpful sometimes but many times, from what I hear, the patient continues to suffer from depression. What is something that others can do to help a victim of depression? From your personal experience, what do you believe could be extremely helpful when treating or helping those with depression? I am genuinely curious and eager for ANY feedback due to my desire of assisting others.", "I'm afraid to try a different treatment that might really help me. So my depression is *very* treatment-resistant. I've lost track of how many different meds and med combos I've tried. Recently it was suggested that I try TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), which has been proven to be effective for depression like mine. My psychiatrist referred me to the doctor who does it, but I've been putting off actually making the appointment because I'm scared.\n\nYou know how sometimes people don't like taking meds because they make them feel like they're not themselves anymore; like they make them feel numb or empty? It's sort of like that, except in reverse. I've had my depression for well over a decade, more than half my life, and I literally can't imagine what it'd be like if it actually got better. Would I still feel like me? I know that things would improve, obviously, but change is scary, and in a bizarre way, my depression is comfortable. It's been a constant for most of my life and I don't know who I'd be without it.\n\nTL;DR- I'm scared to try something that could work because I don't know who I'd be without my depression.", "depersonalization/derealization I'm currently on Zoloft and Lamictal for anxiety. Few months ago I stated having panic attacks, but they resolved with zoloft. Yesterday something very freighting happened to me. As I was talking to my daughter's teacher I felt I was slowly disconnecting from the surroundings. I was forgetting where I was, who I was talking to. This horror lasted 2 hours.

I tried a while ago but I ask to support me in functioning day to day, pushing me to work and they just tell me they're sorry or they wish they could help.

My boyfriend just says he doesn't know how to help me and has phases of randomly complimenting me or texting me to tell me he loves me for two days straight then he forgets all about it. I'm sure he tries his best but I just wish I had more support and he says \"he can't help me anymore than he does\" everytime. I feel so trapped. I always have to pretend I'm fine. I always cover up with humor. It seems like I'm insincere or dramatic when I finally snap and just say I'm a mess. \n\nI can't afford a therapist. My university counselling office won't help me. They offered a suicide hotline numbers (?) and  \"we're sorry but this isn't a psychological support that we do here\".\n\nHow to cope?

To be better. \n  \n  \nI'm starting to think that I really am just as useless as my family thinks I am.", "I\u2019m 21, just recently realized my dad is a terrible person and my childhood fucked me up more than anyone can see. I feel hopeless and have no life skills. Think my family is cursed(?) My dad is an immigrant and came the US in his 30\u2019s after he married my 18 year old mother who was studying abroad in his home country.\n\nHe quickly became financially successful and moderately famous in his industry. Things that came to define him above anything else.\n\nMy parents had me 11 years into their marriage and I have no siblings. \n\nI was homeschooled for most of my childhood and super sheltered from everything in life. Never allowed to have sleepovers, rarely allowed to have friends over, had every moment of my life scheduled and micromanaged.  I was never encouraged to pursue anything except becoming a professional soccer player (which was never what I wanted to do, but something my dad wanted me to do as a way to live out his dreams through me vicariously.) \n\nHe was never around. He financially supported me and my mom and lived in the same city as us most of the time, but was never there to parent me and was rarely even around on holidays or birthdays. He kept his things at our house, but came home maybe once a month, sometimes less. He always said he needed to be closer to work so he was staying at his friend\u2019s house (everything in the whole city is a 30 minute drive or less, and he never worked for anyone but himself.) \n\nNow that I\u2019m an adult, I understand he was living with various girlfriends though he was still married to my mom, and she always seemed to be waiting up for him to come home and finally be a dad/husband. \n\nI developed severe anorexia at 12, and my family seemed to ignore it even though I stopped growing, lost 40 pounds, was rarely eating, and was exercising 4-6 hours a day. When I was literally weeks away from death with a BMI of &lt;12, my mom finally took me to a doctor after my grandma begged her to because \u201csomething was really wrong with me.\u201d The doctor told her I was  anorexic and recommended in-patient treatment and psychotherapy. My mom yelled at the doctor, said \u201cthere\u2019s no way MY daughter is anorexic,\u201d and stormed out of the office. \n\nFor the next 6 months or so, I stayed at the same weight and, nightly, would sit down at the dinner table with my mom and cry for hours while she screamed at me to finish my food. I never went to therapy for the eating disorder and she denied every doctor who told her I was mentally ill. She was SURE I had tapeworms, a thyroid disease, celiac, or some other ailment that had caused me to lose 40% of my body weight. I stayed at a dangerously low weight until I was 16, which is the first year I went to school, and traded my ED for nightly sneaking out, binge drinking, and bulimia. \n\nWhen I was 16, I was almost arrested for trying to buy alcohol, and my dad found out and told me if I wanted alcohol I could just ask him. He started helping me sneak out and giving me alcohol whenever I wanted. I think he did this to drive a wedge between my mom and me, he always loved to have secrets that we would keep from her. He would take me around his 23 year old girlfriend and tell me to not tell my mom. In fact, he would blackmail me, saying things like \u201cdon\u2019t tell mom about so and so, you would hate for her to find out about you sneaking out and partying right?\u201d \n\nWhen I was 17, my dad lost all his businesses and wealth, and has still been unable to recover from the financial loss. He pinned all his happiness on money, and once it was gone he changed completely. Every time I\u2019ve talked to him since then, all he\u2019s talked about is how broke he is and how my mom caused his financial ruin and what a stupid idiot she is. He curses my mom around me almost every time he talks to me.\n\nHe had a long talk with me one night when I was 16. He told me that I should never have kids because they\u2019ll ruin my life. He never wanted kids. He would be a multi millionaire and so happy and free if he had never had a family. My mom is a crazy lunatic and has only ruined his life and finances. \n\nI fell into a horribly abusive, 4 year relationship with a guy when I was 17. I bounced around from college to vocational school, and also had a moderately successful entertainment career. I\u2019ve never been able to find footing anywhere. I feel like I can\u2019t connect with anyone. I really don\u2019t feel passion for anything and don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any path in life that I want to take, though I do feel like I\u2019m talented in multiple things. I\u2019m awful at romantic relationships and friendships (maybe because I never had a healthy relationship example from my family, and never had long term friendships when I was growing up?) \n\nAbout a year ago, I was talking with my dad about how I wanted to get a job that made a lot of money like bottle service. He suggested I become a stripper. And so I did. I danced for a year, and he insisted I call him and tell him how much money I made every night, and he acted like I was so lucky because he \u201cgave me permission\u201d to do this. Like wtf I\u2019m a grown adult who\u2019s been living on my own since 18, and god knows I was putting in the work all on my own for all the money I made. \n\nEvery time I see him he\u2019s so negative and toxic and I realize now that a lot of the anxiety and problems I felt as a child (I\u2019ve been suicidal literally since I can remember) stemmed from the insane toxic energy that always engulfed my family life. \n\nI\u2019ve done a lot of psychedelics, and I really do have a good grip on spirituality and mindfulness, and know there\u2019s something way bigger than this earth plane we live on. There are light forces and dark forces. The thing is, lately, I just don\u2019t feel like I am meant to be blessed by the light forces. Like I was born out of darkness from a cursed family, and I am doomed to be miserable, depressed, and toxic just like my dad. He is not a good person. I think he\u2019s a narcissistic sociopath and it scares me that half of my genes come from that. \n\nHis dad was a total narcissist, no respect for women, I felt unexplainably awful vibes from him always. My paternal grandfather had a very successful business when he was younger, but somehow that all dissolved and he ended up completely broke with nothing to leave to his family, dementia, and a mindset that his children should take care of him (which they did, until his death last year.) My aunt put herself through unspeakable stress and pain to take care of my grandfather, who was completely ungrateful for it. \n\nMost of my dad\u2019s family has ended up in a mental hospital by 70, and they\u2019re all completely depressed or mentally ill, and I feel the same demons taking me under every day. I\u2019ve felt dark forces around me since I can remember. I\u2019ve seen my demons during nightmares and sleep paralysis. I think my abusive ex-boyfriend was influenced by the demons that follow me around. \n\nI can\u2019t see anything good happening in my life long term. I fear I\u2019m going to end up like everyone on my dad\u2019s side. I recently talked about a lot of this stuff with my mom and she started crying and said she\u2019s failed me in every way, she should\u2019ve left my dad when I was little, and she wishes she never even married him because she was a teenager and literally only knew him for a few months before they got married. That hit so hard, because it just made me feel like my whole life was never even supposed to happen. I was just part of one giant fucked up mistake made by a naive 18 year old. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m a lost soul, I wasn\u2019t meant to exist, and because of that the dark energy got ahold of me. \n\nI don\u2019t want to talk to my dad anymore. Am I wrong? I am questioning everything and I really hope I don\u2019t live that long because I don\u2019t see anyone in that family having any glimmer of a nice life over age 55. \n\nNo one takes me seriously when I say my childhood fucked me up so much, because I grew up with a lot of material possessions, money, and a seemingly super involved mother. When people think of bad childhoods, they think of poverty, physical abuse, druggie parents, things like that. Maybe I\u2019m a spoiled brat. But either way I\u2019m just not happy, I can\u2019t remember ever, ever being happy for more than a couple days at a time. What\u2019s wrong with me?", "To all of those feeling isolated and suffering right now... I\u2019ve learned that life is fucking sad sometimes. You start to think that maybe things aren\u2019t going to get better at all. I\u2019ve been at points which I think, it can\u2019t get worse than this, but then I discover a new section of rock bottom, thinking, ah this is it!\n\n I assure you, There\u2019s always something worse than what you\u2019re going through. It can get worse. Per that same logic, there\u2019s always the chance it gets better. I think I hold onto that and you should too.\n\n You might have realised at some point, people in your life leave. They come and go, and the only constant in your life is you. You have your back, and that\u2019s what matters at the end of the day. Keeping this in mind, Take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible. We humans are social creatures, so having this emotional connection can literally save you. It saved me, at least. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about whatever situation you are facing it right now, but do know that you have a power to improve it. At this point, things can either improve or worsen, and the amazing this is that you have the choice.", "My relationship with Instagram. My relationship with Instagram is complicated. While I do see it as a good way to promote certain things like my amateur photography for example, I also feel like it\u2019s repetitive to an extent. I feel like whenever I go on there, it\u2019s mostly the same old kinds of posts. Gym selfies, selfies in general, people who brag about their rich lifestyles, the list goes on and on. Witnessing those kinds of posts over and over just ain\u2019t good for my social anxiety and depression. Does anyone else feel the same way?", "When you lose the will to live, you got a big fucking problem No longer have any passion for my interests, or even any passion for life tbh. Im lonely af, feel worthless and hopeless. I dont want to kill myself though my mind tells me i do. But id much rather be happy, thrive and prosper. Its strange for sure. I'd like to say im a hard worker, im intuitive and a problem solver. There's things i aspire to do, and know im phyiscally and mentally capable of doing in one part of my mind. \n\nThe other part that's always lurking is telling me im a worthless piece of shit and cant do anything and that even if i was successful still nobody would care so whats the point. Recently ive been losing the battle with that other part, and when my mind tries to rationalise my life situation (which isnt even that bad) and thoughts, the conclusion it comes to, is self termination. Sometimes i get too overwhelmed by it and imagine having a gun and pointing it under my chin. I pull the trigger and imagine it all going away almost instantly. It doesnt make me feel better as i do it in moments i might have legit pull the trigger in the heat of the moment. It makes the real me glad i dont have a gun (i live in uk so i cant really get one all that easily anyway).\n\nEdit: I'm feeling calmer now, my demons have been but to bed until tomorrow (i hope). Just want to add, most of the things that my mind perceives as major fucking problems like having no friends or girfriend can be overcome, its not a terminal illness, even if my mind wants me to see it that way. I say this to people a lot but i believe it, with a healthy mind there isnt much a human cant overcome. Look at tyson fury, he was a pork pie with the jelly around it, he was a coke addict. And by getting help with his mental health hes now heavy weight champion of the world. Then people like caroline flack (sorry if i misspelled) got herself in a pretty bad sitaution, and her mental health issues made it seem 1000x worse to her. With a healthy mind she could have gone to court and taken her punishment, and dealt with the repercussions. It would have been hard as heck and taken a toll on her for sure. But it could have been done.\n\nWanting to die or kill yourself is not a rational thought. Theres nothing rational at all about poor mental health. I think it has helped me a lot understanding the science a lil bit. Just the fact that these chemical imbalances can fuck us up in so many ways. Thinking about that definitely helps bring perspective.", "One of my friends died. And I don't know what to do. I got the news that one of my mates I went to school with when I was studying abroad recently passed and I can't quite process it.

What can I do?", "I don't have depression. but I need advice, I tried to post in so many Sub Reddits but it keeps deleting Hey, I'm in a 14 year old female (9th grade), and right now I'm in a low point in my life ( no I am not one of those im14andthisisdeep girls haha). At the moment I really don't want to discuss everything yet, but there is this one situation I do.\n\nALSO please mind that I am bad at expressing myself, so this may sound repetitive.\n\nI'll try to list everything...\n\nMy friend group consists of around 9 people (I think, it keeps adding up, and I'll explain later). There is this girl in my \"friend group\" (can't really say 'friends\" because I am not really close to them) who keeps avoiding me. She started to avoid me around the start of the school year. She started show her dislike around me when my friends were talking jokingly, (I can't recall properly, sorry) that if they were not going to receive any flowers in Valentines Day, hence saying some people in my friend group do, they would group up and watch a movie together. I was curious, so I asked something related to it (sorry, can't remember exactly :(, I think I said something like \"Oh! What movie?\" or \"When?\" (like when would this event take place) ). She then rudely replies with \"Who are YOU!?\". This other girl from my friend group just stared at me (Not in a rude way, but in a way I can't read her expression) I was kind of hurt then.\n\nThis behaviour kept continuing. Around a few days later, I went to the spot where my friends sat, and sat next to the girl who apparently dislikes me. She IMMEDIATELY stood up and rushed (no kidding, she ran away from me) to the opposite side, and sat there. I just blankly stared at her, again hurt the frick for me. The group stayed silent, then same girl who looked at me then said \"Oh, I know why\".\n\nBecause of this, I was in a shit mood. The shittiest mood I've been compared to the whole day. I was walking to my HSIE class (where 2 of my other \"friends\" were in). I asked one of them, (for her privacy, I'll call her \"Sally\") why (let's call her Fiona) keeps avoiding me. Sally replies saying I said something to Fiona *A FEW MONTHS AGO* that pissed her off. Sally then tells me to not worry, and that Fiona is a *\"petty person\"* . (Honestly, I thought okay, wtf? I actually was actually tearing up a bit due to sadness, not to the extent of crying though)\n\nTimeskip to a few days, (with Fiona going to the opposite side of the friend circle *As AlWaYs!1!,* and with me now, I try no to be near her, but even being the slight nearest, she goes even further away). I asked someone who was friends/close to Fiona while going out of my commerce class to the next period. I explained the situation to her (*whilst clinging to the edge of the wall like that Yandere girl from Yandere simulator because I am awkward af, seriously*). She also responds to something similar. She said Fiano used to act up like that to her and I just need to get used to it. (I was tearing up AgAin (not to the extend to cry) \\*le fucking sigh\\*). She then adds \"Oh, you don't like it?\". She then says something similar that Sally said before \"She is just petty\" (ugh so tired of hearing that word from everyone).\n\nTimeskip\\~\\~\n\nShe keeps avoiding me, not sitting next to me. Recently I was going to the bathroom with another girl, whilst walking back to class, Fiona responds \"Hey -name-\" and ignores me (wow, how nice...). When I talk, she glares at me. And more, more, MORE negative reactions to me.\n\nToday, I had HSIE class after lunch. I was 'complaining' (not in an annoying way) about how boring it was. And then fucking Piano responds with \"Maybe if you had friends\".\n\nI pause, literally a flash of emotions hit me: hurtfulness, pain, frustration, anger, you name it. I had just enough with her play and said something around (maybe I should of responded differently, more direct? and not nicely?) \"Why do you hate me, whatever you did, just tell me, I will say sorry\" and blah blah blah. (Sorry, I only started to notice I was too kind this year, and that it lead to me being hurt, and people taking the advantage to go on top of me (yeah, there are a few girls, again? why would you hate me?, who dislike me. I won't talk about it because this thread would be WAYYY too long) ).\n\nFiona then replies with \"Nothing/No you did nothing wrong. \\*I just hate you.\" .\\*I was spreading in a bad mood. Bad morning, had a maths test, didn't sleep because I was staying up studying and also extremely VERY stressed!\n\nThe group went silent, stopped talking. I had enough, I don't want to be apart of the group (explain later). I don't want to be near HER. I. fucking.had.enough. I abruptly left the group (sorry, should've mentioned earlier, but I do that more and more often when she does something shitty to me) and walked around, staring at happy (I mean I don't really know) people with their friends, fake smiling.(ugh for some reason I approached some closely just to stare at them.\n\nUgh fucking amazing life.\n\nAlso I will talk about my friends now.\n\nThey weren't a fixed group, especially around 8th grade. You know when there is a new student, and the teacher would just ~~force~~ put them in your group? Well, welcome to mine!\n\nAnyways, my group is basically where new people come. There has been 1 from 8th grade (never met her before) and an old friend who came back(left). There would be another girl who would hang out in my group and another one (that one more now). This year, 9th grade, already on our 6th week, 2 girls were introduced (I don't even remember their names).\n\nThere are certain things that creates a friend group. For example, if you like books, you stay with bookworms (the \"bookworm group\"). Because of this (tho, nothing like that made me feel close to my friends), my friends group isn't so closely connected to one another. Like lunch is so fucking boring now. When was the last time I had fun during recess or lunch?(Note\\_ 4 out of 5 days I have school meetings on lunch, just SRC things!) Now people just eat due to boredom, and half of them go on their phones. No (little) interactions created. I am quiet, but not the most quiet in the group, now I am. When they talk, they laugh, I don't.\n\nBut seriously, I never felt close to my friends, they would go to parties, parks, movies with each other, where am I? at home. They had photos posted on instagram one time of them in a party. They tagged each other, not including ME (only one, thanks. Btw not close to her though). They printed photo cards of those pictures and shared them to each other as memory (some are on their phone case). One picture was the korean hand heart (that saranghaeyo thingy) they made together as a circle. (Wow, like that didn't;t hurt)\n\nIm not close to them, I feel lonely being around them, and I have no one to talk to, no one to trust. Where do I go now? How do I make friends? Because of this, I've reached out bout my loneliness online (in a few different platforms) to talk to. It's nicer to talk to someone online though.. They don't know me and keep this secret...\n\nSorry, this was longer than I thought. There is more I want to talk about (I never thought something that I thought was small would end up being this long). I may post some more in the future.\n\nIf there is something you want me to elaborate on, please feel free to ask! (But I won't respond if it is too personal hehe). I need someone to talk to...", "i dated a girl and she stole shit from me and it makes me cynical we worked together for like 8 months so we knew each other prior. went on like 5 dates, saw each other a few times outside of that. i left $20 in her apartment because i didn't want to wake her up and ask if it was hers, and gave her my hoodie at her work because she was cold\n\nnow i'm not getting any of that back. it really sucks. i shouldn't trust people that way. i hate the world honestlh", "I have become numb again I thought my depression had lessened because i was feeling things again, but i have been sober for 2 months now and i think it was probably just the alcohol, because i don\u2019t feel like i have been becoming a lot more numb lately, not being sad feels good at least but i think a lot of the happiness has gone with it, i feel so bored.", "I think this is my final straw and I am scared Warning: this is VERY long. I'm not sure what the purpose of it really is but just wanting to put this out there in the world. Maybe I'll get some advice, maybe someone will read it and realize they are not alone.\n\nI\u2019ve started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through. This is yet another attempt, let\u2019s see what happens.\n\nI\u2019m a 30 year old woman, I work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in Graphic Design, volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week, and suffer from depression and social/general anxiety disorder.\n\nI first realized my teen angst wasn\u2019t just a \u201cphase\u201d sometime in my early 20\u2019s. As a teenager I would do the normal things: drink, do drugs, smoke weed. I would also write a lot but this writing, in hindsight, was some of the deepest cries for help. I\u2019ve since lost that precious notebook, but I did come upon snippets of that \u201cpoetry\u201d in my other sketchbooks. The stuff wasn\u2019t anything out of the ordinary - I grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music - and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day. I lost interest in that activity around the age of 20.\n\nI was always a shy person. I played with friends during school, but I was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyone\u2019s house. As a result, I was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone. My parents brought me to Canada when I was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education. I was born in Russia where there wasn\u2019t much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering, medicine or teaching. In that aspect, I thank them. I was able to attend an art school in Toronto and attain my Graphic Design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciates.\n\nWhen I arrived in Canada I didn\u2019t speak much English and was in an ESL program. In that first year, 4th grade, I was bullied for not speaking the language. Some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks (the little pebbles from the playground) down my pants while we had \u201ccarpet time\u201d (when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson.) They knew I wouldn\u2019t say anything, partly because I couldn\u2019t physically, partly because I couldn\u2019t mentally. Kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by, someone even throw things at me from the back. I brushed it off, went on with it. I did have two great friends (one of which is still in my life albeit we aren\u2019t close.)\n\nThis childish bullying subsided after the first year. I went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents. 6th grade was split. It was yet another school (moving from elementary to middle school) and then half way through 6th grade, after establishing quite a solid group of new friends, I was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents. I had to start over with the friend thing and luckily I befriended a girl right away. She was also an outcast, being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didn\u2019t fit in with the \u201ccool popular kids.\u201d Here I was laughed and looked down upon for being new, having 1 friend, and being so extremely shy. After a while I became close with another girl, let\u2019s call her Jessica. 7th grade went by bearably with her around, outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess. I was also developing extremely bad acne, so I was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few years.\n\nEnding of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with Jessica. She had an \u201cin\u201d with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her, I got to hang out with the group occasionally. This is where we started \u201crelationships\u201d with two boys. She was with lets call him Andrew and I was with let\u2019s call him Mike. We would hang out after school a lot and one day I brought them all over to my house. Mike took me down to my parent\u2019s cellar at one point and where I thought I would have my first kiss, my hands were forced down onto his penis. I didn\u2019t know how to retaliate so I went with it. Instead of a first kiss, I gave my first hand job. The next time we hung out was at the movies. I was brought to the bathroom for what I thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job. I can\u2019t remember whether I went through with it, I just remember crying that evening. I soon found out that Andrew and Mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and Jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet. These things bled into high school. The rumours started that I was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school. The photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that Jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun \u201cfashion\u201d night. She wore them too, although somehow the photos of her never got distributed. \n\nFinally a new girl came to the school lets call her Beth and finally things seemed to calm down. We had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school (to the point where people were calling us lesbians.) I even attended her wedding two years ago, she\u2019s a beautiful human being. I tried my best to have a normal life. I threw myself into art. I would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab. I got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me. Of course throughout this time I did the regular teenage girl stuff. I liked boys, I would make out with them. I was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me. I just did it. It made them happy. And in my mind, that made me good at it. Why not do the thing that I felt I excelled at? Of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours. \n\nI first tried drugs in 10th grade. Beth and I would skip school, pop ecstasy, spend the day together. This went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted. I\u2019m not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was, but I managed to graduate high school on the honour roll. At the end of 12th grade I met lets call him Sam. We dated for 2 years, I lost my virginity to him, but I will always remember doubting his intentions. Did he stay with me for the sex? Did he only want me around because I would smoke weed with him? It didn\u2019t matter. I lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit I just didn\u2019t want to, or couldn\u2019t break.\n\nI got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard. After my break up with Sam, I met lets call him Dale. It was interesting at first. He would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates. He brought me gifts and showered with me with attention. I now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour. He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer even if I didn\u2019t really feel like doing anything. The thing with Dale is kind of an on and off ordeal. We were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives. I was starting to get really put off by him, but one night he insisted on hanging out. As you well know by now, I have trouble saying no. So we went to the bar, got a buzz going and then went driving. (I know how shameful it is to drink and I drive. I know first hand because I almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode. I haven\u2019t done it since and will never do it again.) We were in the car and I was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up. But he wouldn\u2019t stop trying to kiss me, to push my hands on to his crotch, then pushing my head down, asking me to just suck it a little. I did it just to make him shut up so I could go home. I haven\u2019t seem him since them. I refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him. To this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous. \n\nThe truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when I began to frequent parties. At first it was drinking, and a lot of it. Then I met a 28 year old man lets call him Izack. He was a DJ and very much into the rave party scene. It was with him when I tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24. Lets just call the rest a blur. I would party twice a week, heavily on drugs, go to school completely hung over. Long story short, I just managed to graduate, scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professor\u2019s heart. I loved Izack. He was older, had more experience, best sex I\u2019ve ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone. He lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well. The sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly. I would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict Russian parents. Then Izack started going on the road a lot more due to his DJ career flourishing. When he was away, I would come to his place and clean everything. I bought him a huge new TV for his room. I wanted him to come home to a beautiful place. In my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week. \n\nAbout a year into our relationship, I went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that I have an STD. They told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication. It was nothing overly serious, cleared up with a few pills but I had to have a serious conversation with Izack. He swore on his life that he never cheated on me. He begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading, I finally did. But I never got over the nagging feeling that something wasn\u2019t right. So after a month of uncertainty, over the phone on my birthday (I remember that day so clearly), I asked him one more time. I\u2019m not sure what made him tell me truth this time around, but yes, of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how I contracted the STD.\n\nI was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months. The drugs and alcohol increased. I went on Tinder and began my first sex binge. At one point I managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week. All I wanted to do was to forget the hurt and I didn\u2019t know how. Again, all of this is very blurry so I can\u2019t say the exact moment that Izack came back into my life but he did. I remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure, to finally say I forgive him and that I\u2019m moving on. That meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex. We then got \u201cback together\u201d, continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again. I let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again. I think this is where I learned how to numb my brain from hurt. I wasn\u2019t mad at him anymore, I just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on Tinder. After a few months of this, I met a guy lets call him Jon. \n\nWe dated for something close to a year. This relationship was also fuelled by alcohol, drugs and parties. But at this point I didn\u2019t want another life. The relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day. For example, he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage. I was told I was crazy on an almost daily basis. I will fast forward to the end, where a girl (who is now a friend) reached out to me saying that she was also dating Jon, for 6 months now. She spotted us at a party kissing, and lost her mind. Apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together. It turns out, that we weren\u2019t the only ones. I came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me. This included his upstairs neighbour who I was constantly told not to worry about. \n\nI laughed at this. I didn\u2019t cry, I didn\u2019t feel angry, I laughed, pulled out my phone and on to the next Tinder binge I went.\n\nIt took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship. This one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me. It lasted for about 2 years. I met his parents and he met mine. We were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment. We just weren\u2019t right for each other.\n\nSo this is where I am now. 30 years old, living back with my parents. I have since stopped the partying because that life doesn\u2019t satisfy me anymore and my body can\u2019t handle it. I have been coke free for about a year now mainly because I can\u2019t afford it. But I drink. I drink several times a week because I can\u2019t stand my job. I drink because I feel trapped in my own mind. I drink because of my living situation. I drink because nothing I do excites me. I drink about 3 times a week and once I crack a bottle of wine, there is no way I can stop. That bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not, a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until I pass out. \n\nThe job thing - realized I\u2019m the only one who can help myself there so I have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isn\u2019t an option. I go to work, I laugh with my coworkers, but at the end of the day, the only thing that makes me happy and that I took forward to is that next drink. I started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but I always fall off the boat because I can\u2019t stay excited and motivated. \n\nLast night I came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad. My mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldn\u2019t find my cat, or so she says. She then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so I had hidden. Long story short, my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and I am terrified. I feel like I have nothing happy to come home to. I spent all last night crying and today is the first day I didn\u2019t show up to work because of this. The thing is - I don\u2019t know if I want to stop. I\u2019ve had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away. I\u2019ve cut myself on numerous occasions. I have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication. I did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary. My dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night, but this is an offer I\u2019m not sure I want to take. I just want it to be over. The only times things are okay in my brain is when I am sleeping, or when I am heavily buzzed. I don\u2019t have children, nor a boyfriend and I have maybe 2 friends, so I\u2019m finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on. \n\nI would like to finish by saying how awful I feel about putting this out there. The amount of times the word \u201cI\u201d is used is upsetting and selfish since I know there are people out there who have it way worse than me. Like my parents have pointed out numerous times, I have nothing to be sad about. I have a good job, a warm house, food and water. I have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one. And they are right. I have it so good. But inside, that dark cloud just won\u2019t lift and there is no way I can describe it in words to someone who hasn\u2019t felt the pull of it.\n\nThank you, from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully, attempted to read it, or even glanced at it.

I, as well as most people on the subreddit, have depression. I've been struggling with it for a few years. Recently I was prescribed with welbutrin.

I've been struggling with my weight for a while as well but I was just laying in bed and had a weird switch get flipped and now I want to change my diet, i want to start going to the gym and be active. It's crazy because I'm lazy as fuck. Maybe doing this will help a lot with my depression. \n\nI'm scared though because a few years ago I broke my back while playing football. I was really active outdoors. I played football for the school, I kayaked, hiked, etc. Not being able to do those things has caused me to gain a bunch if weight and become insanely depressed. I lost feeling in my toes for 6 months after the initial accident. I wasn't able to do anything active. My toes are fine now but the fact that I'm not able to do what I used to do because of the accident has caused me to be depressed. I dont want to be depressed anymore, I'm sure everyone can relate. I want to get my life back the way it was and the only way I can do it is to step out of my comfort zone and find someone who will be willing to help me achieve my goal. \n\nAlthough it may be difficult, I know if I try my hardest I can achieve my goal.

So, here is the post.\n\nI will frame unnecessary explanations with \"//\", in case anyone reading wants to skip. Although I'd like to warn you that this post is somewhat long regardless, as I like to explain things.\n\nI've been considering myself unworthy (of a real friend, of feeling better, of complaining) since a long time, as I have a nice life, or because that I'm not feeling as bad as many other people who are said to be depressed. I obviously never wanted to be sad, nor to experience bad things, but I wanted to be worthy of some certain things I felt I needed. Over time I began feeling worse and worse, to a point where I compare myself more than I used to do, where almost everything upsets me. \n\n//For example, let's say there is a character I relate to and am happy about being alike. That used to be a source of motivation. Now when I see this character, I can only think of how much better this said persona is compared to myself, and how I can never be like them. When I look at something I value, rather than being happy I feel worried of what might happen to them. Or, when entering a new season I mourn the previous, alongside all the time I wasted.//\n\nI'm mostly worried, stressed, or sad. The thing is that there is no clear reason for me to feel so.

There are some occasions where I thought I didn't feel anything, but couldn't help crying.\n\nThe reason I'm writing this post is that, while watching a show, a character explained a 'negative' habit of the other, which I ultimately related to. It's not something I consider to be really bad. However, after that scene I couldn't somehow focus to the episode. My interest faded to a point. It was almost as if I was reacting to what was said, but I don't even care that much. The character cared, but not me. Was I impersonating his emotions? Or am I just faking all these to feel worthy?

I went through many years of art school, and while studying I was doing well. Art has been synonymous with my identity forever, and I've always wanted to be an artist more than anything else.\n\nBut I've also had mental health issues my entire life, and I've gone through a couple of periods of terrible depression in the past. I've been medicated since I was a child, so that's helped most of the time. But now, starting last autumn, I've gone into a depressive period that's a bit different than the previous ones. \n\nI think a combination of my medication losing efficacy and experiencing an artistic burnout are the reasons for this depression. I did two solo shows recently and have been pushing myself to draw so much, so I think burnout is very likely. In any case, I started to notice that I didn't enjoy drawing anymore.\n\nDrawing became a terrible, dreaded chore. It started to feel like way too much work - and that work was not interesting or exciting. The work was also difficult and just SO much. SO many lines. Honestly, when I think about drawing I start to feel physically unwell. \n\nI've been advised to take a break from drawing, and I'm doing so. I haven't actually drawn anything for about a couple of weeks, and I'm going for one month. \n\nI'm just so terrified that I'll never enjoy drawing again. I can't even remember what it feels like to not hate drawing. But I still want to be an artist so much. Plus, I honestly don't have any other hobbies unrelated to art that I could focus on. Nothing else really interests me.\n\nI should also mention that I'm switching medications right now, and I'm about to go onto a full dose of my new medication (which is actually one that's worked for me in the past).  \n\nI've never experienced anything like this, and I'm so scared.

After a moment of silence I dreaded her answer and then she startet trying to say something. She tried and tried again and again until she finally said: \" I am in love with someone else... And the thing is it's not another male.\"This has been really hard on me. I don't think she's a Lesbian but i, felt how insecure she was about her own sexuallity and that she was sooo afraid that people would not accept her anymore. Now i am stuck in a wierd af situation. I still really love her and I feel like giving up on \"us\" isn't even an option. She has been one of my best friend in ages and I dont want to loose her.

I am afraid of, well not afraid but the things I think about on a regular basis. I worry if my daughter will be taken away from because of my crazy ex-wife. I worry about what my daughter thinks or will think of me because I have no goals or ambitions right now other than to make enough money to outshine my ex-wife. I want to do all these things, but I am too worried about everything that will go wrong with them. I want to start a business and be successful, but I am afraid of failure and getting stuck right back where I am, which is like resetting my whole life. I worry about if I am going to get cancer because I am addicted to chewing tobacco and want to stop for my daughters sake because I don\u2019t want it to influence her life because I have been told it is bad for you. I worry about being alone the rest of my life because I can\u2019t seem to find anyone who loves me or is it because I am to shallow and don\u2019t think anyone over 150 lbs. is pretty. I can\u2019t sleep because my mind races and races at night and these things flow through my mind. I worry about looking successful to the people around me which holds me back because I don\u2019t want to show how unsuccessful I am right now. I feel like a failure and a worthless person. the only thing that gets me through the really really tough thoughts is my daughter. And if I wasn\u2019t here who would raise her. The pressure around me to do the right thing is tremendous but what is the right thing? Is the right thing what everyone thinks or what is socially acceptable? Is the right thing what I think is right? but then why do other people think some of the things I do are wrong? What makes them right? I think about the things in my past that I could have done differently but what\u2019s the point? I can\u2019t change them so why do I dwell on them? Do I need to even worry about them? I worry about how I am going to pay for things if I lose my VA disability but I don\u2019t want to go to my VA appointments because I feel it reinforces the fact that I am messed up and I come up with excuses as to why I shouldn\u2019t go. to try to reason with myself as to why its ok not to go. It\u2019s also a distance away which wastes 2 hours of my days sitting at home doing nothing. So is it helpful to go to an appointment and lie to a doc for 15 mins telling him that every things ok and I take meds, Which I don\u2019t take my meds because 1 I hate taking medication every day and 2 I don\u2019t like to think taking them helps but they do because if I took them then I might not be writing this. I know I need to do better but I work at a dead-end job that has no future for me. I am just a pawn in someone else\u2019s business story. I want to make more money, but I don\u2019t know where to go because no one is telling me where to go and I am afraid to start anything just to fail. I don\u2019t want to waste my time doing something and have that time taken from me by an unforeseen event. But why do I worry about an unforeseen event when I can\u2019t even see it coming. Is my life that messed up that I am worried about something that may or may not happen. I sit here typing this looking into my baby monitor telling myself I need to do better for my daughter. What example am I setting for her if I don\u2019t do anything with my life. I thought I had my whole life planned out then boom my world is rocked by an unhealthy relationship which everyone but me saw. Everyone told me I shouldn\u2019t have been with that girl. Everyone told me I needed to leave her. But as clich\u00e9 (why did I just look up how to spell clich\u00e9 in something I am only going to read) as it sounds, I loved her. Or at least what I thought was love. I was ready to spend my life with her, but she went and fucked two other people and who knows how many others. But blamed me because she thought I had an affair\u2026. Which I didn\u2019t have an affair. I write this hoping my feelings will leave my body and I will not worry about them anymore. But for how long is it going to last? Is this really going to help? Maybe I\u2019ll post this on some reddit website and become famous for it. Ha who am I kidding. I am nobody. I am a middle age man who has been handed a fucked-up life and can\u2019t get out. But it\u2019s not as fucked up as some people\u2019s lives so why does mine hurt so bad? Maybe I am stuck on the materialistic things and want to hide behind them. Like having a nice truck but not as nice as the one I want because I am smart enough not to burry myself in debt and have that looming over me. I am content on doing nothing but am afraid of everything. I tell myself I am meant for more, but I don\u2019t know how to get there. I am smart but not smart enough to figure out how to make myself happy. So, am I really that smart? I can tell you all night and day that I am smarter than what I am doing right now but have nothing to show for it. I think everyone is out to get me in some way shape or form, I don\u2019t trust anyone, I think they all have some agenda to serve themselves but don\u2019t we all. Is anyone truly selfless? Now I am just rambling to ramble so focus, focus on why I am writing this. Focus focus focus why why am I handed a dealt of cards that has no instructions? is that life? What\u2019s the purpose? Why do I even waste my time? Why can\u2019t I win the lottery and hide behind the money at least I will be able to do the things that make me happy because I won\u2019t be constrained by money? But if I did have it would I really be HAPPY? I think it would be better than where I am. But why would I be so lucky as to win the lottery when there are stronger people out there who deserve it more than me? is luck a figment of our imaginations? are all the strings being pulled by some divine or supreme power? Some might say I am on drugs right now to think like this. I\u2019m not. This is how my mind works and I think it\u2019s a blessing and a curse. Who will even read this? Now it\u2019s just becoming to long for the quick reader to think it\u2019s interesting and too short for anyone to take it seriously but I\u2019m not writing it for them I am writing it for myself. I want to get better I want to do better. But where are the answers? Do I make up the answers and hope I get by? Do I tell lies and belittle other people to get through life? Why not? It feels like other people, all people do it to me. Who is coming to punish those who do me wrong? Do I do it? No, why? because I am afraid of the consequences. I am pressured by everyone to do the right thing. Maybe that\u2019s what governs people? Then why doesn\u2019t everyone act the same? Are there to many questions in this? Who cares? Its mine right, maybe I will share this so someone can laugh, someone can feel empowered to do the same? Someone can belittle me? I need to do better I need to push myself to do better. I started working out because I thought I might get laid if I look better. But is anyone even going to notice? I wasn\u2019t in shape before and got laid, sort of\u2026 I more or less have always found the girl who is in need and made her feel better, then when that wears off, I am alone\u2026 am I going to be alone for the rest of my life? At least I have my daughter, right? But eventually she will leave me too because no one wants to be around someone as depressed as me\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t want to be around me. I always hear this saying on the radio or tv or what have you \u201c you have to love yourself before anyone can love you\u201d\u2026 who am I kidding I will always be alone because I don\u2019t see myself loving myself. I am fat, ugly and stupid. I don\u2019t have any value. I don\u2019t have the ability to love anyone else because I just want to use the other person to make myself feel better. But how is that? Does that even make sense? Am I connecting with anyone? If this is circulating around and you are reading this far, then possibly? Should I keep going? Maybe I still feel like going. My fingers are starting to hurt but it feels a little better to not have all these things bottled up inside me. Maybe it\u2019s because I am pretending to type it to an imaginary audience. so, things I worry about. I worry about paying bills, but I am good at financial stuff. So that\u2019s ok but I still worry about them. I worry that I am not doing the right thing. I worry about what other people think of me but that\u2019s ridiculous. I should not worry about that right? I worry about the spelling in this, but I have spell check. I worry about sleeping all day when I have my daughter because she could hurt herself because she is 2. I also worry she is going to grow up and think I just slept all the time, but she doesn\u2019t know I was up until 3am writing a stupid paper about the things I worry about. But that\u2019s not her fault. I worry about making a good impression on the people around me because I don\u2019t want to be alone and the only people around me is family right now. I seem to piss everyone else off. Why do I piss them off? Because I am pushing people away so they can\u2019t hurt me. Is that an excuse? I worry about getting into an accident and not being able to take care of my responsibilities, but should I? I worry about being someone else\u2019s burden, I don\u2019t want to hinder someone else\u2019s life with my inability to love myself. It is no one\u2019s problem but my own. But there are people who want to help me or are they getting paid to do so because someone decided it was good for business to make money on others suffering. #cancer maybe that\u2019s too much. I definitely can\u2019t post this anywhere now. I worry about getting up in the morning and it being my last day. I worry that all of this will pile up and I\u2019ll do something I can\u2019t take back. But that\u2019s why I think of my daughter, I worry I\u2019ll be trapped in this life and these circumstances for a long time because I am too afraid to take a leap of faith and just try to make my life better. I worry about anything and everything. I don\u2019t care about anyone other than my daughter truly, her life is the only real thing I care about. She is so innocent, am I contaminating her life by being in it though? Is my negative thinking rubbing off on her and will she be like me? I hope not. I see the negative in everything. I can\u2019t think fast but when I do think at my own pace, I can figure shit out. I worry about being in a situation I can\u2019t think my way out of. I truly worry about everything. My daughter is being pushed into school. Well I think so. Her mother doesn\u2019t want her to not be in school, because she is ready. I think it\u2019s because her mom doesn\u2019t want to take care of her and wants to push her into school so someone else must deal with her. She seems too young to start preschool in my mind. Why do I care so much about what my ex-wife is doing or thinks? Maybe it is because I have to deal with her for the rest of my life, not like she is going away and I can\u2019t not talk to her because then the court will see me as being unfit to parent then I will lose my daughter. I don\u2019t want that now do I. I feel like my ex-wife has her life together and mine is falling apart underneath me but maybe she is just hiding it like I am trying to do? But I\u2019m the one writing this so we will stick with my feelings. I don\u2019t want to lose my daughter but everything I do I am feeling like it is a movement on a chess board and at any moment I am going to get check mated. Who even uses a term like that anymore? Apparently, I do. I worry about who is going to care for my daughter when I am not around. I worry she will fall into something and I can\u2019t save her. Literally and figuratively. I worry my life is pointless then I think of her smile and watch videos of her, and it makes me happy. I worry I am a burden on people, and no one wants to deal with me, so I try to hide myself.

I can\u2019t eat food without worrying about it being poisoned or worrying about tapeworms.\n\nI can\u2019t have a basic conversation without worrying about whether something I say will come back to haunt me\n\nI KNOW these things are stupid and will probably never happen, but my brain keeps on throwing me the \u201cwhat if?\u201d and I won\u2019t be able to move on. I\u2019ll even get physically affected by my anxiety- my eyes will burn and it will get harder to breathe\n\nAnyway, my mom set up an appointment for a psychiatrist (I\u2019m 18 and I\u2019m still not smart enough/have enough money to set one up myself, I feel worthless already, pls don\u2019t remind me) and I went there today.\n\nThe guy seemed like a good guy and everything, and made me sign paperwork as I was talking to him and everything, and everything was cool. On the way out, my mom asked the guy how much the bill would be, and he said it would be around 300 dollars for the first visit and around 150 for every visit after that.\n\nI\u2019ve been so upset ever since. I feel so bad. I told my mom I didn\u2019t feel good going to a psychiatrist if it would be that expensive, but she\u2019s super super supportive and insists on me getting help (she goes through anxiety too, to a lesser extent).\n\nThen, my brain got the idea that what if the papers the guy made me sign was really a contract that would come back to haunt me later (ex-what if I signed away part of my future income,etc.) it sounds so stupid and it is. My brain just sees everything as a threat and is stuck in a perpetual fight or flight mode\n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel Iike for the past eight months I\u2019ve just been a drain on my parents and everyone around me. All I am is a burden that can\u2019t even make myself happy. I feel like if I don\u2019t go to anymore appointments with this psychiatrist, I\u2019ll have thrown away 300 bucks of my mom\u2019s money for no reason, but if I do go to another appointment with him, I\u2019ll cost her 150 a pop. I feel like I\u2019m taking advantage of people and I feel like I\u2019m too stupid to get my act together. I just want to be able to be happy again and have peace of mind. I\u2019ve watched myself literally go nuts and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. To add to it, this is all in my head. I can\u2019t even tell reality from obsession anymore. This whole battle that I\u2019ve fought for the last eight months is all in my head. I\u2019m not doing anything productive by fighting OCD. I\u2019m just wasting my time and I feel like ocd is just my excuse for being worthless. I just feel so hopeless and guilty.", "I\u2019m sad and I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m sad I thought all my problems were settled but no.

I kept getting cut off and people almost hit me. Eventually I just thought \u201cthanks god she\u2019s here because I just wanna drive off this fucking road\u201d.

I quit my job 3 months ago because of the stress and anxiety it was putting me through. Of late my mental health has worsened a lot and I can't seem to get out of the loop. Everything makes me cry and I don't even feel like going out of my room most days. I go to a psychiatrist and I am on meds but nothing seems to be working. (Ive changed almost 7 therapists/psychiatrists now because my mental health was showing no improvement.) I feel like a parasite, latching on to my mother and aunts for financial support. I want to move out and live independently but I don't even feel anything. I don't feel like doing anything, let alone wanting to work. I constantly worry whether I'm just being lazy and making excuses or whether I genuinely have a problem. I don't want to face people, give interviews or work among other people. Everytime I get a job I end up having panic attacks and excessively stressing out. The thought of having responsibility and knowing that there are certain expectations I have to meet while working, and the constant anxiety of doing badly at my job trouble me so much. I don't want to go through any of this. I don't want to. I don't want to do anything. I'm tired of being taunted by everyone and having to dodge questions about why I'm still unemployed.

My brain races at 100 miles an hour at all times, every little thing I over analyse. I have seen my only friend go through drug addiction and drug related psychosis. I have seen how life can shit all over you. \n\nMy depression started at an early age because of bullying and lack of friends. Except the one in my life currently, you can't destroy our relationship. I feel like my depression really kicked in when I was around 15 or 16. My friend moved away to another city and I was left all alone. At the time bullying got worse and I made a few acquaintances but no real close friends. When I was 17 I dropped out of school and moved out of my family home. I started to have panic attacks in the shower and that was when I turned to drugs to numb the pain. Xanax was my go to for sedation as I could fight the effects somehow I loved that. Iv been a daily cannabis smoker for most of the time since I was 16 except the times I ran out and couldn't get anymore.

My mood fluctuations have not changed over the past year at all, despite me starting medication. However what I have noticed is that I'm able to contextualise thoughts and feelings a lot easier these days.

It comes in waves and always has done, but I'm feeling it is affecting my productivity a lot less than it used to, obviously I'm more productive when I'm not feeling like this, but by Monday I probably won't feel like this.\n\nI used to have thoughts of ending it, still do sometimes but I'm glad I didn't.

At the end of my junior year of high school I had a really bad breakup and lost all my friends causing me to start self harming and isolating myself from everyone. Thankfully, this acquaintance I had took time out of his day to make music with me at lunch. It really meant a lot to me. He was the only friend I really had at the time. I had hung out with his friends a couple times before throughout high school, so I started playing video games with some of them. Eventually during the summer I got really close to them, and I became a part of their friend group. They really brought me out of that dark hole of depression, and I had never loved a group of friends more in my entire life. I had and still am going through extreme social anxiety, but helped me become more confident in myself and alleviated that a bunch. In the beginning of senior year I hung out with them after-school basically everyday, and it was the happiest I\u2019d ever been. \n\nI don\u2019t want to get into details but then something changed. A bunch of the group dynamics changed that made me felt inferior. I thought they thought I wasn\u2019t as funny anymore, and was more weird and awkward. I reverted back to the state I was in with my previous girlfriend, and I started to worry incessantly that I would be abandoned by them. My mindset about the group also changed. I felt like I had to constantly meet their standards and entertain them or else they would abandon me. This has made socializing with them more of a grueling chore than a fun experience. I\u2019ve isolated myself from them a lot, and I even feel a bit of anger towards them. \n\nThere are these events that happen that make me feel like they think I\u2019m weird, awkward, unfunny, and annoying, so I constantly try to change myself. I try to be less talkative, and apply a tight filter to what I say. I hate who I am. I can\u2019t live with myself. I feel like everyone I interact with thinks I\u2019m all of those things, and I can\u2019t stand it. I hate everything about myself.

Hi, I'm an eighth grader at a magnet school. I have ADD (attention deficit disorder), symptoms of depression, and I'm suicidal. For the past 3 years I've slowly been less and less motivated to do anything, even what I enjoy. I just want to go to sleep forever and forget about all the stress of school and a difficult social life. I get very stressed over school as the stakes go up, and my mom is constantly reminding me that I'll be a failure if I get too many B's. It doesn't help that my friends began ignoring me more and more when we started middle school with new, better people to hang out with than me. I'm treated like a tag-along now. My former best friends only talk to me and listen when they're bored and nobody else is there to talk to. I started having thoughts of suicide near the end of seventh grade, but it's really gotten worse this year as more is expected of me and my friends cast me further away. \nI decided to finally talk to someone this year, since my previous hints of needing help went unnoticed by my mom. On a day where I felt very low mentally, I told my mom I was suicidal. I broke down crying, and she hugged me. However, she said, \"Don't EVER even think about killing yourself. Do you know what that would do to me?\" I was a little upset about her reaction, as she seemed more concerned about herself. But I kept telling her more. I told her about how I thought I had depression, and she dismissed it as \"stress\" and said it would stop if i started to be positive. I was taken aback by this. I love my mother a lot, but she's never been good at giving advice or helping with my mental health. I got mad at her and began yelling about her never understanding or helping with my feelings. I was a little too extreme, but the anger was not irrational. She yelled back something about her trying to help with the grief counselor (1. She didn't help very much. 2. She was there to help us deal with grief over a family death, and she didn't help with my suicidalness). What made me feel worthless was when she yelled, \"What do you want me to do about it?\" and told her I wanted her there for me to talk to and she went on about my grades, what have I told you, learn to deal with your emotions better,  etc. I ran off crying to continue my homework. A few minutes later she came in with her phone and my dad was on a call. She had told him. She was mad about me not focusing on my homework and I needed to hurry it up and finish and stop crying. I kept crying, upset she didn't help, and a few minutes later my dad arrives. He was upset that I wasn't working on the project and \"wasting time\". I kept crying until he started yelling to stop crying. I stopped, tears welling in my eyes. I love my dad too, but he can't control his anger very well, and he follows his parent's ways of discipline, which is what he grew up with. As he lectured me I started clawing my arm to calm myself like I always do. He noticed me leaving scars on my arm and got angrier. He told me to stop and said this: \"Do you want me to do it for you?\" This really upset me, but I said nothing to avoid an argument. He got me to finish the project. He said he cared about me and loved me, and he left. No discussion of my mental state. My mom called him when i started crying later and he wasn't mad this time. He told me to go to sleep and feel better. I didn't feel better when I slept.\nI just needed to get all that out.... I've been considering suicide a lot, and I know there's \"help everywhere\" like hotlines and such, but it won't help. I need people I care about to talk to.

I just need to know what to do, because I honestly don't know anymore. The people I care about most can't help me, and I feel worthless. I never know what to talk about, and when i get to talk for once, my friends look at me different than they do at other friends. They look lost, bored, and like they want me to hurry up and get it over with. Then they go back to talking to the other people.

I've been unemployed since last October after getting laid off (not due to performance, my whole team and 15% of my company got let go) and do not have a firm idea of what to do with my life. I have started to interview again over the past few weeks but they are mostly for the same type of work (which is pretty niche, not a ton of jobs available) and I just don't know if this is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. In the meantime, I have been getting dicked around by recruiters and just feel like I'm getting left out to pasture even though I feel like I have a good background and interview well.  \n\n\nSimultaneously, I am finishing up a part-time MBA program which I feel like has been a colossal waste of time, money, and energy. I honestly feel like I had better luck getting responses to job applications BEFORE starting my program. I have been slogging through my final semester, struggling to find the motivation to do my work. I finish in about 2 months, at which time I may or may not be employed again. I just don't know. It's extremely stressful. I will need to begin paying my college loans within 6 months of graduating and don't know how I am ever going to save for a down payment. I immensely regret going to business school.  \n\n\nAdd to this the fact that, for whatever reason, I seem to be getting ignored by just about every therapist I've reached out to for counseling. Maybe I need to start leaving messages that I'm thinking about ending it. I feel like I am losing my mind, and the only thing that keeps me feeling sane is my girlfriend, who without I'm not sure what I'd do. Unfortunately, she doesn't know about my compulsive  masturbation/porn addiction which seems to be consuming my life at the moment. I'm a \\*\\*\\*\\*ing mess and I don't know what to do.   \n\n\nIt's hard for me to think about actually killing myself, but I find myself thinking about it often.

My Parents divorced when I was 13. While they were married, my siblings and I witnessed verbal abuse, threats, dad pushed our mom, mom crying, dad coming home drunk, and even after the divorce they constantly talked bad about each other . Since the divorce, I became really sad and it follows me until this day. Some days I\u2019m happy and then there are days where I cry myself to bed. The day they divorced, police had to come to the house because my dad was trying to hurt my mom. Soon after I witnessed my younger brother change from an innocent child to a drug addict. My father was an alcoholic who is now dead. My mother had the nerve to say to me \u201cI don\u2019t why your brother is like this... he didn\u2019t have it that bad.\u201d My mom really doesn\u2019t know the trauma she caused me and my brother.

(I'm not even gonna say all the things I did to get the money) but then. I just got off work. And I was about to swing by the bank to withdraw the money to lay rent. But then my car wouldn't start. And I'm completely alone in this state. So I had to call someone to come out and jump me. But it wouldn't jump. So I had to spend money to get it towed. Then the damn mechanic shop jerked me around, and ended up fighting with them alot ( I use to be a mechanic so I know when I'm getting jerked around) but they were so incompetent, that it took them 6 hours to basically figure out that the battery needed to be replaced and then do it. They lied to me when they told me the tested the battery when they first pulled it in the bay. They put a new starter on, without telling me until after the fact. And then told me my engine was seized up due to there being 0 oil in it. Which I dont know if I believe, because I just got my oil changed about a week and a half ago. And I know I dont have a leak. So either they were lying or the technician at the luge shop didnt put oil back in my car. But anyway, long story short. They forced me to pay 600$ for basically a battery change. And then I had to go back to work 2 hours later, with no sleep since my last shift. So that was great. But that 600$ was going to be for my rent. No I dont have any money.

This is an accumulation of experiences that are similar for me and I know what will happen in a few months I'll be the most hated person at that job and everyday I go, they will most likely give me hell.\n\nCan I say I have a mental health condition to my employer if I haven't been diagnosed? I don't really want them to personally attack me every time I enter a new workplace because I would like a chance of living too. Why are people so quick to assess one another then give them hell because one person front talk properly? \n\nI really needed a job which is why I never said anything about a mental health condition as I believe this would have almost certainly affected my chances. \n\nWhat should I do? Because if I don't do anything then I know what will happen during this adventure of employment, I will have to leave because of comments and accusations that aren't true. Something doesn't seem right there. Also, I know there is something wrong because hardly want to talk to anyone nowadays. I have no friends out of choice as an example. I dreamt of working very insular jobs growing up. Well may as well kill myself because no one can help they can give me placebos but they won't give me the one thing which will cure depression and other mental illnesses in an instant but they can't give me the job I wanted to do with my life so tell me what is the point?

During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had. I liked knowing that despite my decision I would die knowing I had an impact on someones life.\n\nHas anyone else felt that way?\n\nI've been to my psychiatrist and adjusted my meds and know I'm doing great.

I know it's pathetic, but it's just the way it is. And obviously I have big self steem issues and hate the way I look.

I really feel sorry for my parents, cause they have no idea how I really feel, and I just can't picture myself saying all this to them. I wish I could kill myself without making my family suffer.

The other one just confuses me since one day she would be praising me saying \u201cyou\u2019re so smart\u201d \u201c how are you so good at everything\u201d then the next day she\u2019ll be like \u201c you\u2019re so fucking dumb you\u2019re and idiot\u201d \u201caren\u2019t you smart so like you\u2019re supposed to know that\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t you even know fucking anything\u201d just to make it clear I never really liked having those types of compliments since it made me uncomfortable since it\u2019s like what if I all of a sudden don\u2019t meet their expectations or something. I feel like my \u201cproblem\u201d is just me overreacting but I\u2019ve been trying to distance myself but on the bus while they\u2019re next to me I can hear them talking shit about me. I keep to myself around them I don\u2019t talk to them but they still talk to me asking why are you ignoring us. Again I\u2019m probably just overreacting but I just need advice on what I should do since I\u2019ve been getting more anxious and what they say about me gets to my head sometimes.  (Sorry I\u2019m not really good on explaining things so if this get confusing sorry) :(", "I don\u2019t have the energy to keep going anymore : ( Honestly it\u2019s just constant exhaustion and pain and stress, it\u2019s too much for me to handle.

I felt like we could tell each other anything, like out souls were connected. But little by little, they began to drift away. Their social media now filled with photos of people I didn't know with captions all about their 'bestie' or 'sister' or 'wifey'. That used to be me. I ask everyone to hang out, even try reconnecting with old friends, every time I either get ghosted or a simple 'omg I miss u too! I'm just so busy rn but we should totally hang!' with no follow up. I'm alone. Every weekend i sit at home with my cat and watch Netflix. I can feel the stress building up on my shoulders with no relief in sight. I just want to have that experience of being around someone who wants to be around me too. I would kill to have a friend again", "What depression feels like I can\u2019t put it into words all the time but depression to me feels like I go through life with this tight tight pressure just squeezing on my heart all day long and I just have to ignore it and go throughout my day with nobody knowing what\u2019s going on. But when I snap and I cry it\u2019s because the pressure has just built up too much and I just can\u2019t handle it anymore but I only snap in private because once you cry and once those emotions are out of your system and you have momentary relief you think, well that was silly and it\u2019s not that deep I\u2019m fine. And then this cycle of pressure builds up all over again and you just have to pretend like nothings wrong but you\u2019re truly not ok. \nI can\u2019t explain this to the people in my life cause I\u2019ve always thought maybe I\u2019m just making up my depression because I can go throughout my day. I\u2019m not bed bound. But if I reflect on my life, I\u2019ve always tried to cope in some way. I used to binge eat so much and I notice I have the urge to do it whenever I\u2019m feeling especially down. Then it was movies &amp; tv shows I would drown myself in for hours and hours. Then it was music to drown out my own thoughts. It was reading endlessly at some point but I\u2019ve lost all interest in all of those things and I find being awake to be so draining so now all I do is go to my classes and go to sleep. I hate being awake. I hate feeling this pressure in my chest and it sucks because I was free from it for a few months and it\u2019s back and you just try and tell yourself you\u2019re just having a bad day but you know it\u2019s some sort of relapse. It\u2019s hard because I don\u2019t want to take medication, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to make things worse for me and I don\u2019t want to be numb I just don\u2019t want to feel pain. On top of that there\u2019s so much fucking stigma. I can\u2019t talk to my parents about it cause whenever I do they get angry I feel sad because I\u2019m their eyes they\u2019ve given me the perfect life despite all the abuse when I was a child. I can\u2019t talk to my friends cause they\u2019re all optimists with the \u201cit gets better\u201d attitude and it pisses me off cause all I want is to get held and just cry. I always feel like I\u2019m being punished for something and I don\u2019t know what cause I try so hard to be there for others. Whenever I can\u2019t find love and I see ordinary people super happy in relationships I question what\u2019s wrong with me (I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m super attractive but I have assets that would at least attract people). when I start questioning why I can\u2019t find a good relationship or someone who likes me it loops back into my thought of well how do I expect that to happen if my own father walked out on me as a child.

I literally told my manager \"How can i care about someones remote not working and sit with all sincerity to trouble shoot, and I go home everyday to no heat and my dog shaking uncontrollable, but keeps a smile on his face for me?\" I was unable to pay my electric bill, so they are trying to evict me on the premise of breaking the lease. All of this is breaking my faith. I am trying so hard, but everytime I get a head there's something trying to break me. Today I have fallen back into my depression and cant help but say it's better to give my pup away to someone more stable and kill myself. I cant keep going and dealing with uncertainty or being homeless. I try so hard everyday, to just get pushed back into the void.

My life is at a really good point right now, I'm never really depressed over stuff and 99 percent of the time my mind is clear. I'm about to graduate high school and I'm really excited. However, people in my family and friend group have tons of issues. Wether they sleep all day, hate themselves, or have no ambition to keep living on in this world, they've got problems. I don't wanna sound like I'm gloating, but usually I'm the person that a lot of these people end up going to because usually I'm able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run. Yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesn't feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless.\n\nBut today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me. I talked to him about it and it's mostly because of how painfully \"bored\" he is and he doesn't even know why he's doing it (he's a pretty logical guy). He will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because that's the way our school works. He has clinically diagnosed depression, has been to a psychiatric ward, and sees a therapist regularly. It's only been a couple hours since he showed me his arm, and I didn't even see all of it. \n\nI've got two main problems right now. First I don't really know how to help him. He said literally the only thing I can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesn't just sit in bed all day. I've been trying to make an effort to do that as much as I can but I need to do more. He said himself that as long as he goes to highschool, and considering it's the law, he's going to feel this way until we graduate. I just need to know something I can do to help him, do I tell his parents? A therapist won't help he already goes to one. Should I talk to him more about it tomorrow. I just don't know\n\nSecond, stuff like this is really effecting me. I just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone I care about and I just want everyone I love to feel better. As of lately I've been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and it's really weighing down on me. I just don't want to leave the people I care about down in the dirt. \n\nSo yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me.

The weeks before that I was improving but I'm spiralling downhill hard again", "Feeling helpless and hopeless It's been a hard couple months. \n\nTo break it down in a simpler manner; \nI'm a General Manager at a restaurant, working ~65 hours per week. My husband is 29 years old, diagnosed with Crohns about seven years ago. He has been unable to work for roughly 2 years. About a year and a half ago, he had a surgery that required removing roughly 6 feet of his intestines. Due to us not having health insurance until recently, hes been unable to do follow up appointments or get onto much needed medication to manage his disease. His Crohns is getting worse. We finally got him into the doctor's in January when we got health insurance. They've done several CT scans, and keep finding more and more abcesses developing in his intestines. He has another surgery scheduled for this upcoming Tuesday, but he had to go into the hospital again today, due to an abscess that is bulging out of his stomach. I have two puppies at home. With my husband being in the hospital, and myself working ridiculous hours, it puts a lot more on my plate than I have already with work. I feel like a narcissistic POS wife, because while my poor husband is in the hospital, I'm more worried about how much more stress has been put on me. \nI've been through a lot of trauma in my life. A physically abusive father growing up really messed with me, and I'm just now realizing the impact it's had on my every day life. I was in a 4 year relationship with a man who cheated on me the entire time we were together. He abused me physically, verbally and sexually. Manipulated me, and really mentally screwed me over. I was the one paying our bills (on $13 an hour) while he sat at home for 4 years doing absolutely nothing. \nI've been through a lot like I said. Most of these situations I have put myself in. \nI'm constantly tired, unmotivated, and angry. All the time. I've reached a point where I just want to give up. I feel like I'm in a neverending cycle of problems. I fix one thing, and three more bad things get thrown at me. I'm working my ass off every day, plus some, and I have nothing to show for it, since we are so far into medical sent that we are scrounging for money. I'm 25 years old and I feel like I'm 50. I've had several panic attacks over the past couple months, many if which have happened multiple times per day. Anytime I go to the doctor for my anxiety/depression/ADD, they throw whatever meds they can pull out of their ass at me, and tell me to come back a couple months later. I have tried several medications and none of them seem to do anything for me except zombify me. I've tried journaling, I have tried exercising regularly, i have tried everything i feel like!!! I dont know what else to do. My friends are no longer existant, and I dont have anyone to talk to.

I don't talk to my friends anymore about it because they just think being strong is the key and that I will be fine. I don't feel fine. I used everything up and now I am here, jobless, broke, and not even caring to take care of myself anymore. What's the point, you know?\n\nI would like to hear some kindnesses you've witnessed.

I had some of the coolest experiences from seeing a shark while snorkeling, to being right next to feeding manta rays. It was an amazing trip and I loved it so much. \n\nBut the problem I have is that whenever I have gone on vacations, even when I was young, I would cry and be horribly depressed for the next few days to a week or two. I hate going on vacations because I know that I\u2019m going to feel like shit after. Nothing feels right when I come home and I just want to be spending \u201cone more day\u201d out away from real life. I hate it because I know that I will have to go back to work and that I won\u2019t get another vacation like this for a very long time. I hate that I can\u2019t explain how I\u2019m feeling to my wife because she\u2019s lucky enough not to have to experience depression except from a third person perspective. \n\nI so badly want to still be out on Hawaii, or anywhere I\u2019ve gone on vacation to, because out there, I don\u2019t have to care about work; I don\u2019t have to care about school, bills, or family drama. I can just be. I don\u2019t want to have to go back to work and school on Monday, but I know I have to or else things will be worse in the long run. I hate that I\u2019m feeling like I shouldn\u2019t have gone to Hawaii in the first place. \n\nI loved spending all that time with my wife and enjoying that week together. I loved seeing things that I never have before and being somewhere that I haven\u2019t been. I loved having that time to do whatever I wanted and not feeling badly that I didn\u2019t do anything I didn\u2019t want to. I loved the anticipation and excitement leading up to the day we left. \n\nI think that\u2019s from where a lot of my depression stems: building up the anticipation, then it\u2019s here and it\u2019s so great, but then it\u2019s gone sooner than it arrived, and you go back to anticipating nothing. \n\nI feel like life is mostly boring, dull, and no one really wants to admit that, so when you get a few days to enjoy yourself, after, it feels like the nothingness deepens and you sink further into it. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this made any sense or if anyone is going to read this, but I really just want to stop crying and go to bed.", "I'm putting down my dog in a couple of days I can't bear to fucking do it.

I've lost my best friend because of it as they are going through the same things as me but I just havent been the best person to talk to. My meds make me feel less and less like me every day and the void inside me is just getting bigger and bigger ever day. I've spoke to my doctor and they asked if I'm suicidal and I told them I was, they then asked if i made any \"concrete plans\" which I responded no. They then basically said coke back in a week and see how you feel. It's like no one even cares if I had concrete plans to kill myself I wouldn't be going to the doctors would I? My depression has consumed me and I feel like there isnt enough of me left to fight back. People say that it does get better but in all honesty there is no guarantee that it will and I'm not sure if I want to spend the next 60 years of my life fighting a battle I cant win. I'm not sure what i want from this post i just wanted to get it all out and if i do end up taking my own life atleast this will be here so family will have some insight into how I was feeling.", "I have stopped bleeding.... Due to fact that I have been doing self harm as way to punish myself for about a 1yr now my pesky razors won't make me bleed and bc of the lack of blood my hands and feet are always cold and purpleish, my wrist is partially numb, and I'm always tired mentally or physicall.

I make fun of my friend for being skinny and punch her around. I jab at my other friend everytime she makes a little mistake. I'm an asshole.

But I\u2019m starting to realize that I can\u2019t get better it\u2019s to much I\u2019ve tried countless times and loose hope ever time it doesn\u2019t work. I really truthfully don\u2019t think I am able to or will try to get better anymore I think this is it I think I give up on trying the pain of failing is to much. Honestly I can\u2019t do life I\u2019m so tired", "I feel a void in my chest after she broke up with me I thought everything was fine, we even had plans to hang out that day, she said she loved me, I said I loved her.

I have no one now and I feel like I lost a part of myself", "Need another perspective? I had a depressive episode so I moved back home, and have had depression for years but never confided in anyone. \n\nMy parents are great and caring, and my mom is even a nurse, like 80% of the time they\u2019re great.\n\nBut sometimes my mom can bug me.. like in the waiting room at the clinic while waiting to get recommended for a psychiatrist for depression she says: You still have it right?\n\nLike what?! She has a nursing degree and asked that. I mean she\u2019s usually very supportive but just this small thing makes me very confused. I am doing much better now that I have a routine and am not alone and suicidal everyday but just because you don\u2019t see my depression doesn\u2019t mean My depression went away.\n\nI\u2019ve hid it for at least 6 years and i was very good at it. I\u2019m an actor. But it irks me that she would say that.\n\nI\u2019m 19 and sorta tall sometimes when we\u2019re out shopping or something she talks about things that I\u2019d rather not discuss in the middle of the mall, like \u201coh, yeah we should discuss when you should attend classes,\u201d and we never discuss this at home.\n\nIt feels like she\u2019s justifying my presence, like this is why I\u2019m here with my 19 year old son on a Monday shopping and he\u2019s not in school. Honestly it\u2019s embarrassing and even if Im overthinking it I feel anxiety in public and I really don\u2019t like standing out.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure my depressions from her side of the family as she and her grandmother have had antidepressants. Don\u2019t get me wrong we\u2019re close and I love her, but sometimes it\u2019s very annoying and any constructive criticism I give the way she responds is never in a way that doesn\u2019t make me feel guilty about pointing something out.\n\nWhenever there\u2019s a problem she seems to blow it out of proportion, and I\u2019ve stopped trying to help because if we go down a wrong street I become implicated in the problem and she makes it feel as if the world is ending even though everything works out. \n\nSometimes it feels like she lets things go wrong on purpose, I can\u2019t even count the times we have gone out for something and she forgot her bags, or we forgot to bring some package for the post office, or something similar. Whenever this happens she says \u201coh I should have thought of that\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so stupid\u201d \u201cI should have known\u201d and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things. I appreciate all the things she does but if it\u2019s something she organizes for example shopping like I have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible, or at least I do somehow. \n\nI just can\u2019t understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose, regardless it affects me.\n\nI know not everything here was directly about depression but I thought because it relates to my situation might as well say what\u2019s on my mind.\nDoes anyone else have perspective on having depressions and living with parents? Im lucky to have supportive parents but sometimes I\u2019m not sure how to deal.", "I've been having chronic pain and I'm partially blind Hi I'm 23 years old\nIt was October 2019,\nI was having intense headaches and nausea, it was my birthday the 24th. My family thought it was normal because of my period 2 weeks go by the pain is worse and in tense. I was taken to a hospital, and a neurologist saw me and said I had no signs of any problems whatsoever but to make sure he prescribed me declofenac and to get a resonance on my head. \n\nNo tumors where found and the declofenac made my problems worsen, I went to a different hospital where my grandmother sister works as head of emergency and pediatrician. The doctor who attended me stated I was fine and had nothing, I studied for a nursing license and knew the look in the doctors face when I told her I'm still in pain after administrating medication was of \"she just wants drugs\" face. I told my grandmas sister and she told me, that the doctor who attended me they always fight because of her attitude and insinuation on patients. At this time I was already 2 months in pain, my family tried to look for other know neurologist in the field to see what's going on and none of them knew.\n\n3 months I was talking to a friend and just for a moment I felt numb, numb as in I didn't feel any pain. My dad got scared and saw my left eye drift away, he took me to a oftalmologist. He didn't know what's going on when he checked me so he referred me to a hospital specialized in neuro-oftalmologist. I went through the emergency room and I was obviously angry frustrated you name it. The doctor checked my eyes and told me I had papilledema, and it might be cause by the birth control pills since I was always having issues with my hormones. The blood pressured my eyes thus having nausea, headaches, desoroentation, sensitivity to light, and insomnia.\n\nI was treated for papilledema and I can't use any birth control whatsoever, but now I'm still sensitive to light and I see like those huge TVs in the 90s and VHS. Because my left eye was left with nerve damage, I can't see my peripheral view from both my eyes. the left eye its been losing the blur I see and it's getting darker, as in pitch black and have like a 1cm of blurred or I think even less. I'm also not being able to see most colors or differentiate in deepness (as in stairs, steps, holes etc) \n\nIt's been 6 months now..\n\nI changed doctors, learned myself to go through my surroundings without depending in my eye sight. I no longer have papilledema and I still get headaches even when I try to force my eye sigth, plus In December we found out my knees is more above than usual and that's why it pops out. But that time it popped out it didn't went in and now I have to use kinesiology tape to have support and control over it.\n\nI've been snapping at a lot of people degrading me, telling me it's nothing, people are in worse situations be grateful.\n\nBut I'm not allowed to snap, I'm not allowed to defend myself, I'm not allowed to call people out when they make me feel like I've literally gone through nothing.\n\nI have no friends, and the people I know don't know my position. Because they literally don't give a sh*T\n\nIm social whenever I can and this was my actual fear losing my eye sight. I'm not afraid of risking it, making hard decisions, animals, crisis. My fear is actually coming true..\n\nHow am I not going to feel depressed, sad, upset, angry, frustrated....\n\nHOW?! I literally use the keyboard voice option instead of writing and Google assistant.\n\nEverything I liked reading books, watching old movies, going to cons...\n\nAnd the worse part is my son hides from me every time he gets because he already knows mommy can't see, so I freak out when I can't hear him or feel him in the house.\n\nI'm just going to end it here, cuz me getting upset also makes my head hurt more than usual.", "After a failed attempt, I'm starting to really feel like retrying I botched my suicide attempt, but I know where I went wrong.

I am 34 years old and I have been dealing with these episodes of worthlessness since probably middle school. I grew up in a small rural town in Puerto Rico. I can\u2019t say we all know each other, but everyone knows everyone else\u2019s business. \n\nI  grew up in a  strict pentecostal family with many rules forced into my siblings and I. We used to go to church usually 7 days a week and on Sundays twice (Bible school in the morning and afternoon/evening service).  Secular music was prohibited and any tv material that was deemed \u201cdemonic\u201d by the pastor. \n\nOf course, living in a pentecostal family made a huge impact on who I was from elementary school all the way until I decided to part ways with the faith later on in my 20s. I was so insecure about myself and tried super hard to fit in with the other kids. It was a challenge because I never felt understood by the others, mainly because I had nothing to relate with them. I was not allowed to listen to secular music or even go to the movies because of rules my mom enforced on all of us. \n\nThat insecurity grew even stronger when entered high school, which of course was the worse years of my teenage years. There were so many things happening in my life at that moment that I thought in some weird way it was all normal. \n\nDuring the last years of elementary school my dad decided to distance himself from church. He became an alcoholic shortly after and everything went downhill from there. He multiple affairs that my mom was ware of and that didn\u2019t turned out well for me. My mom became aggressive and depressed. I used to get hit for no reason that I can remember to this day.\n\nI think she felt trapped because divorcing my father was not an option due to her fanaticism. My mom used to break stuff every day, scream and yell, stayed inside her room all day and praying for the most part. One positive thing I can say about her is that we were never hungry and somehow she always found ways to provide us with clothes and food. \n\nMy dad disappeared for many months one time and I thought he gave up on us but specially on me. I felt so betrayed by him. My mom was also non-present in my life or school. My grades dropped drastically and I was bullied a lot at school for being alone the majority of the time. \n\nThere is so much to say about everything that happened but, I thought I was over that and everything that happened. Today I am angry at my parents because how irresponsible they were with their kids. I compare myself to every one else around me and I feel like I should\u2019ve had a better upbringing. I know it\u2019s up to me know and they are no longer responsible but it still hurts me so much. \n\nI deal with my insecurities every day and that is something I\u2019m never gonna be able to change. I compare myself a lot with everyone.  I tend to feel like a way lesser version of whoever I am comparing myself to. I\u2019m going to therapy and that helps to a degree. I just wish I could find people or at least someone that can relate to this. \n\nIf you read this far thanks and I apologize for the typos or grammar errors.

So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that\u2019s right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn\u2019t care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I\u2019ve been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. \nWell the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren\u2019t getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I\u2019ve spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you\u2019re just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I\u2019m fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I\u2019m going to call tomorrow and I\u2019m asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That\u2019s right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them \u201cdo I have to say I\u2019m suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??\u201d It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that\u2019s a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. \nBetween that and the insurance screwing me, I\u2019m truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I\u2019m NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m simply saying that it\u2019s no wonder there\u2019s such an issue with mental illness in this county. \nAll that being said, where does one go from here? I\u2019ve tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else\u2019s. \nHere\u2019s the conclusion I\u2019ve pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren\u2019t getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right? \nI don\u2019t know. If this is what our society has come to, I seriously want no part of it anymore. It\u2019s disgusting and I am to the point where I hate people in general. I know that sounds bad, but go back up and re-read my post if you really want to try to understand why I am starting to hate people. I wasn\u2019t always this way. Yes, I\u2019ve dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another. But here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom. I look back at times when I thought I was depressed before and I think to myself - I\u2019d give anything to go back to that time and redo things. \nI don\u2019t really have anything else to say.

I told her that I was depressed and she walked away, angry, slamming the door behind her. The person that I love the most turned her back on me when I needed her the most. I went for a walk, we messaged each other, and she asked me to come back. She was crying so much, I felt bad. She felt terrible for not listening to me.

Generally, I am a calm person - an introvert (more ambivalent), I liked being with myself, I liked to help, I was quite specific, very empathetic, although I stayed with other normal cool people.  I couldn't be a dick.\n Over time, I noticed that I stand out.  Others went somewhere, spent time, etc. Problems started in high school when it came to partying, crazy outings.  Everyone snapped, told their exits as if it was unknown.  And I didn't have anyone but one friend.  I found that something was wrong with me and I began to change.  I wanted to reprogram, upload other more extroverted software.  At that time I had a completely distorted picture of reality.  And for example - I have always been balanced and did not make quick, ill-considered decisions.  Seeing that others don't do it, I suppressed it and added it to my new \"software\".  Seeing that others do not respond immediately to the huts also so began to do.  These small, seemingly low risk examples have changed me.  There were plenty of them.  I did so with everything.

I realized what I had done and wanted to unprogram. I began to think, I analyzed my personality a lot  , what should change, how to behave and feel. I tried to remember my previous identity. I had so many copied habits that I didn't know how to behave, feel, think. I didn't feel like myself, as if unreal, in a dream, without contact  with feelings, emotions.\n The situation continues to this day.  I do not know who I am.  I don't feel anything, I don't feel myself.\n The only thing keeping me alive is the awareness that it used to be good and it's all in my head.  I often have thoughts of suicide.\n I have sick thoughts - I classify people according to their qualities that are useful and not, I divide people into better and worse.  I do not feel anything.\n Not once during these 4 years did I feel alive.  No sadness, no shot of joy, no intense feeling.\n He constantly compares himself to others.  I do not know how to be myself - I look at others, I wonder what they feel, how they think, what chances I would face against them.  The psychologist and therapy did nothing.

But i know that depression can make you unproductive and drop your grades, but my grades in school are still really good (its still hard to concentrate in class i just understand subjects on my own) and i do daily tasks like showering and cleaning.

Hi, I wasn't sure where to post this since it relates to a relationship. I've dealt with depression since my early teen's. It continued to be a major problem in my life until about my mid 20s when I met my current partner. Because of how emotionally mature, supportive and trusting he was, I felt my espisodes we not as frequent or as severe. However as I began to hit my 30s, I started to notice the larger issues that I overlooked when I was younger as not important, like his finanical health (how he views money/saving). He holds a job with little responsibility and low-stress but pays as such (i.e. near minimum wage). He did work overtime for a time to afford a house, which he has but needs me to pay half the mortgage in order to afford it. He says I'm the love of his life but he's not interested in getting married. He's also almost nearly a decade older than me.\n\nI feel trapped because as much as I love him, I want to leave. The major reasons I want to leave are different views towards finances, marriage and moving (he doesn't want to move away from where his parents live). I've been wanting to leave for a very long time but I'm also scared. This decision has caused my anxiety then depression to spring up full force, comptemplating suicide because I'd rather die than live on my own. I haven't lived on my own since my early 20s and every time I lived alone it would result in me being suicidal nearly every day. I struggled, graduated late in college and managed a business degree that did nothing, but earn me an unstable job history and act as a cover to people that I'm doing okay. I just realize how emotionally dependent I am on him and that scares me too. I have no family or friends to talk to about this or for any emotional support. I also hate the state I live in as there are many bad memories here of past abuse. My parents also live here and our relationship remains strained.\n\nWhat I want is to move out of this city and start over but I don't know if that's my depression talking or what. I don't trust my own decisions or judgements. I have low esteem for myself and my choices. Back to the reasons for leaving my partner though---I feel like who am I to say what I want in a relationship since for instance, I can't even hold a steady job so again, makes it hard to leave him. I'm also currently in school again to once more try a job more suitable to my personality--massage. Until then, I'm stuck living with him for another 6 months.\n\nHow do you find the courage to live on your own? Past that, how do you find the will or care to live? I don't have anyone. I mean, I won't have anyone if I leave him and that scares me into staying with him too. Or should I just stay with him and work things out? I'm not sure. I just know I can't sleep well, don't eat much and been crying every other day. Sometimes I just would rather die than have to make a life decision...\n\n\\---\n\nAre people with mental illness subjected to whatever relationship they can get?

I\u2019ve been doing videography and editing stuff for almost 10 years, beside doing my passion project, i also earn a living by edit and produce video for small businesses.

Knowing my own lacking, i study and research as much as i could about independent film and unfortunately in my country, indie scene is basically non existent. I decided to fund my own film, because nobody wants to finance a stranger like me. \n\nEarlier this year, I thought this year will be the year I finally made it. I sold my car and use my saving to fund a film project which i hope can be the one that gets people attention. As i slowly developing the project, i met several industry folks, with the intention of gaining knowledge and get some support, but instead all i got is them dismissed and laughed at my project because I\u2019m a fool to even dream about making a film with my budget, and more importantly, I\u2019m nobody. I was treated nonchalantly. Hate to say this, but i do agree on some of the points they gave.\n\nNow I\u2019m aware, even if i did make the film, the chances for it to actually help me further my career is slim.

Some days I think I am getting better, that I can make better habits and get myself out of this crutch.

It's so disheartening, it feels like I'm trying to swim through tar towards some land that is miles and miles away. I know people care about me, but it doesn't feel like it.

I maybe acting in a way which balances all the embarrassments I deal with. \n\nI keep thinking about past moments where it's fucking embarrassing and then I hate to fight to being the person to desire to be. By embarrassing it means either people telling me on my face which hurts me and they know it but still choose to say it because they know Im boring now and I don't have the confidence they saw in me they used to. I'm on their side on this cuz I they are true. And I don't know how to help myself out of this. \n\n To be honest I'm lonely like literally lonely only because of me. I'm not open about my feelings and try to just move the conversation about general things. I only love people but not give back anything or show it. Theres not a single person who I have a nice relationship with right now. I mean to say I don't have but they do. Few of my friends care about me and don't want me to get hurt but that's all. I don't like my family because I'm thinking like this just because of their conditioning . I hate my insecure mom who is highly egoistic of herself and can't handle rejection or appreciation she gets defensive for very small things and also expects me to show love to her and give the attention she needs all the time and if I don't do it she gets hurt again and gets defensive. I hate that she's like that and that's in me . That is my biggest problem because I have conversations in my head to fix her cuz I don't want her to be that way and I do this therapeutic talk all the time with her and me. Im starting to get sick of it and handle this. I know all the ways she can't get offended and it's not hard and it's my problem to deal with convincing her. I can't fucking do it I wanna leave her but I can't live with guilt she has given me till now that I can't live by knowing she's gonna get mental if I leave her. She has friends but they're cringe as fuck saying I love you or I hate you. All they talk about is that. She wants everything without deserving it. \n\nWhen I say all this about her I know that I act like her and when I say I hate her I hate the part of me that's her. That part of me is not leaving me. I try to give people guilt trips unconsciously or give them situations where I get rejected and I won't take it properly.

I'm 24 years old and have recently graduated from college with a BA in art. Art has been my passion since I was a little kid and I hope I can one day have an exhibition showcasing my art. \n\nSo back in 2019 just a few months after graduating college I applied for this artists residence program. I knew that I probably wouldn't get accepted as these\u00a0 residences are usually very popular and I was still buliding up my\ncareer in art. But I still wanted to try and get more experienced in writing applications and though I'd give it a go and you never know I might just be lucky enough to be accepted. \nThis particular application had to be sent in by post. So I asked my mum for a stamp. Later that day my dad sees the stamp booklet and asks what it was doing there. So my mum told him. He just conpleatly lost his shit and started yelling at my mum. He was arngry that my mum hadn't told him about my plans to apply for this residence. I could hear the yelling from my bedroom and came down to see what it was about. \n\nI can't remember everything that happened and what was said. But basically my dad felt that this was a terrible idea. That the residence wouldn't be good for me and that I shouldn't be moving out. \nI kept trying to explain how there were many benefits of doing this residence. And how I wouldn't be moving away forever. Besides I was 23 at the time. A lot of people my age had lived away from their parents. He, however, couldn't get his head around it. He thought the residence program wasn't legitimate. Despite the fact that I  found out about it through my college lectures and how they literally give us seminars on how to apply to these residences. \n\nHe keep yelling and screaming causing my mum to cry and sleep in my sister's room that night. \n\nI didn't let the events of that night keep me from pursuing my dream. Fast forward to a few days ago and I'm working on another application for a artist residence. This one also has to be sent in by post. So this time I tell my dad what I'm doing just before he went to bed. He rolled his eyes but didn't say much. \nThe next day I'm printing off my application and I can hear my dad speaking negativity about this residences to my mum.\n\nMy mum is so kind and loving and supportive of me and my dreams. I really couldn't ask more of her. \nAnyway. I come into the room and tell my dad that I can hear him talking about me. \nHe says similar stuff to what he said back in 2019. How he's thinks its a bad idea. How he thinks I shouldn't be moving out. He is of the belief that I'm looking at this with rose tinted glasses. I try to explain how I'm not some stupid little kid just following some whimsical dream. This is my passion. Its the thing I have a degree in and very much plan on pursuing. \n For some reason he cannot understand what a \nresidence involves. I thought the team residence made it fairly obvious. However I try to explain how its a place you live and work in. So you can produce artwork in a proper studio. He's still just shaking his head saying its a bad idea. I ask him why he thinks its a bad idea but he just cuts me off and tells me to tell him why its a good idea.\nOnce again I try to explain the benefits. Because I'm just making small bits of Watercolour paintings in my bedroom and having a studio would be so much more ideal.\nHe stars asking questions about how they chose people. I explain about how you send in a cover letter, an artist cv, and images of your work.\n\nFor some reason he keeps referring to the residence as a course. My mum and I tell his how its not a course its a place to live and work. He doesn't seem to understand. \nHe says how the only people who will benefit from this course are the people running in. \n\nHe seems to believe that because I wouldn't be paid to attend this residence that its a waste of time. \nI'm not even asking my parents for money to fund this residence. I planned to pay the rent myself. \nThe he says how I should be looking for work. He's a bit of a booomer. He seems to think that there's loads of jobs going round and I just couldn't be bothered to get one. Not true. \n\nI had a job not too long ago but it was temporary contract work which ended a few weeks ago. \n\nHe has the nerve to say that when he, himself has been unemployed since the early 2000s and my mum is the main breadwinner.\n He just happens to be related to wealthy parents whom he inherited loads of money from when they died. He doesn't know the struggle of looking for work or having a strict budget. \nI asked if he'd prefer if i were in some dead end job that made me miserable. No he says. He'd like to see me in a job that makes me happy. And he sort of suggests to continue with art on the side but apparently working and doing an art residence is just too much. \n\nAnyway, getting back on track. He mentioned how he thinks I'm too vulnerable and not ready to move out. I don't know how he's going to react when I have enough money saved up to move out. But he can't stop me from moving out and living my own life. I haven't even been accepted by the residence program and he's acting as if I'm leaving to live on the other side of the world.\nEverything up to this point has been very upsetting and stressful and depressing. But than he goes and says that I'm not good enough or talented enough. Thst these no future in this residences. No future in art. \n\nThat fucking hurt but I highly suspected this. I told him that I already knew that. This man hasn't even seen half of my art. Hasn't see what I'm capable of doing. And doesn't understand how the art world works. If I were bad I wouldn't have gotten my BA. It's still so hard to not let his words get to me. I'm still planning on applying for open calls to residences and exhibitions. I know i have talent and I work hard. Even if I'm not currently good enough that doesn't mean I should stop. The only thing that will stop me from having a future in art is if I give up.

She decided now was a good time to ask \u201cwhat would you do if you didn\u2019t have me and your dad to feed you and keep you?\u201d A pleasant topic of conversation. I said, \u201cwell, I\u2019d be homeless and sleeping rough I\u2019d imagine mum.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem satisfied by this response and decided to go on a tirade about how I should seek unemployment benefits and such. Which I would, but my last ounce of pride won\u2019t let me. I should also mention that I haven\u2019t asked for a penny of charity from her since I got back. Anything she and my dad have paid for is listed on my phone and I fully intend on paying her back when I\u2019m working or have some money coming in. I haven\u2019t loaned money from my mum since I was at uni. Not because I didn\u2019t need the help, I just couldn\u2019t handle the arguing anymore. My sister however, currently owes my mum and dad thousands and they don\u2019t chase her for it. Whenever she needs help they drop what they are doing to help her. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just bitter about that because my mum makes the statement \u201cwe treat you both the same\u201d all the time, but I know they don\u2019t. \n\nShe continued to twist the knife until I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and just walked out of the room. \n\nI should say, that she doesn\u2019t seem to mind having me around when a delivery is coming and she wants to go and see a friend, or when I make lunch and dinner, or when I do housework. I feel like a should help out around the house where I can. Most of the time it\u2019s not good enough for her, but at least I tried. \n\nAfter all of this I\u2019m just left with this feeling of uselessness and that I\u2019ll never be good enough. Maybe I\u2019m being over sensitive with how much is going on (my ex and I broke up last month, so not that long ago). I don\u2019t know.

Very painfully (for me) over the past few months I've lost my best friend. Despite my trying to make things better I couldn't salvage things. We've gone from a really good friendship to barely talking at the end of the day, mostly because of routine. I still care about this person greatly, but its pretty clear thats not the case for this person\n\nOver that time period, my mental state has just gone down the drain. This person was really my only reason to get out of bed in the morning, and be the best version of me that I can be.\n\nI've gone from an A student, to a B student, to a C student, and now im having trouble bringing myself to do any schoolwork at all.

I live in a small town where more people here fake being ill to get out of work or have other habits.\n\nI\u2019ve been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember being alive. I was first fully aware that I wanted to die since I was 6, I\u2019ve begged for it every day of my life since then and every birthday, that\u2019s what I wished for; even til this very day. \n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been going to a doctor in my town to continue working on my depression, she prescribed me medication which started to make my state worse by an increased amount of suicidal thoughts, more flashbacks, and now irritation as well as mood swings. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with PTSD, Dysthymia and Anxiety. I\u2019m constantly trying to make it a point to address to every doctor I\u2019ve been to in the past 8 years that I literally hate being alive and I\u2019ve even been honest as to how many times in a span of a year Ive tried to commit suicide, even up to date. I\u2019ve tried signing myself into our local hospital to try to be admitted to get real help and they\u2019ve only ever kept me for a night each time. Ive begged to stay and I\u2019m still sent home since I seem calm. \n\nI have always acted like I was fine in front of people since I was raised that it was not okay to be depressed or show negative emotions as I had an abusive mother. Because of that, I can\u2019t express sadness normally, instead I just seem calm and most thing I\u2019m being sarcastic or trying to be funny. I don\u2019t openly cry in front of others since I honestly hate people seeing me cry when I\u2019m a support figure for a lot of people I know. \n\n\nI\u2019ve tried making appointments with psychiatrists (we don\u2019t have psychologists at our hospital, they\u2019re hours away and I can\u2019t drive), but they often push Ativan which doesn\u2019t react well with me. I\u2019ve spoken to therapists and they have said I\u2019m getting help in that way but I also need to be medicated if therapy isn\u2019t doing much for me. \n\nDoes anyone know what I should do?\nI can\u2019t keep fighting this anymore. I\u2019ve been doing all that I can and I feel like it\u2019ll never get better when all I do is hide in a bathroom and cry each night, wish that I was dead if there\u2019s no fix for what\u2019s going on or just isolate myself from others so I won\u2019t be a burden anymore.", "Worth? I hate always being reminded our lives are going to school, getting an education, hopefully get a good paying job and pay taxes. I know there are other stuff, Marriage or whatever.

It\u2019s sad to see depression hold me down. If I need to be happy I need to change something. I hate taking meds and being on a schedule. People are gonna treat me different if they find out. My dumb arrogant self also lashed out at my girl best friend. I think she hates me. I said sorry like a million times, I wrote paragraphs to get her to forgive me. She recently came up front and told me she was feeling suicidal recently, and me getting mad at her just made it worst. I\u2019m trying to fix it as best as I can. She said if she can get a hug but she still won\u2019t talk to me in class, hallways, or over text. Her reason is she doesn\u2019t like getting personal. And she\u2019s told me in the past she\u2019s had family problems, so I know she\u2019s stressed. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m annoying her but I\u2019m keeping positive vibes. Just today one of my \u201cfriends\u201d with ADHD said his friend was gonna give him a gun and shoot two teachers. I trust one of my gym teachers the most in the school, more than my family. I mean the guys gone through it. I had him for class a year ago, and in that same year he was divorced. He knows depression and stress. Anyways I told him and he thanked me a bunch. I think he\u2019s speculated I have depression, he\u2019s a health teacher and I always talk to him so I know he knows somethings off. He sent me to the VP and told him the story. They both basically hailed me for keeping the school safe. And I\u2019m grateful. I like being reminded people care for me, I just don\u2019t see it. And neither do you probably. Think of an old teacher or friend you always talked too, I\u2019m betting they\u2019re missing you right now. \n\n\nAlright I know I wrote a lot but it just kind of blurted out, I knew I had some stuff going on, but now I\u2019ve wrote it out I see the bigger picture of my self.

Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking  with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, \u201cdid that even help if you stopped going?\u201d\n\nHe told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school\u2019s records.

Today I\u2019m just going to do it. I\u2019ve been feeling abnormally sad for almost five years now. I\u2019ve never gone to get clinically diagnosed with depression so I won\u2019t say I have it-but after having some dark thoughts these past three years...I won\u2019t deny it if that ends up being the case.\n   I have always had a small group of friends, and that circle is down to three. Out of those three friends, I have had one since 1st grade. After a mess up on my part (that happened almost three years ago), we haven\u2019t been as close as we once were. We don\u2019t share emotional things anymore. But we do laugh and joke a lot. That\u2019s mainly what our friendship is now. We only talk when we see one another, and if we contact each other over text-she usually finds a way to cut the conversation short. I know I\u2019m loosing her. It hurts but I know she will find someone better than me to be by her side....\n   I have a second friend, she\u2019s been my friend since 6th grade. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m loosing her as much as the others-but life issues are getting in the way of me seeing her so we haven\u2019t been able to talk much-if at all...\n  And my last-perhaps my closest friend now, just admitted today that he doesn\u2019t believe in the whole \u2018friendship\u2019 ordeal. He said that he believes none of his friends actually like him-and he said that right to my face today. He\u2019s detached from people, and when he thinks people don\u2019t care about him...he doesn\u2019t care about them. On top of that he\u2019s been really distant lately, and we don\u2019t have the deep conversations like we did in the past. When we talk it\u2019s about nothing in particular and it hurts the most seeing him go because he\u2019s always been there for me during my super low times. In response to what he said, I promised him that I would never stop trying to show him that I cared for him, but he brushed me off and said have fun trying.\n   I feel like I\u2019m loosing my friends slowly. I don\u2019t talk to anyone anymore. I feel alone. I hate going out into public because that reminds me of how people have friends...when mine are slowly fading. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. They are the reason I\u2019ve been pushing through-and the reason I have pushed through in these past five years. I don\u2019t know what to do.\n   I can\u2019t talk to them because they aren\u2019t very emotional, and the one that is (the one that I haven\u2019t been able to see due to life issues) doesn\u2019t deserve this type of weight on her shoulders. I guess this is just more of a vent to get this off my shoulders.

It started to get better at around 11th grade. Before that I have never really experianced girls that were nice to me. But for as long as I can think I have been dreaming about the soft touch of a woman. Not sexually but just being hugged. Or snuggling. Now at the end of 10th grade I started self-improving like theres no tomorrow. And it went uphill for me real quick. I started to work out daily, started fighting sports, joined the volunteer firefighters, volunteer wildlandfirefighters and recently sent out my application for the german red cross. It all went well exept one thing. I still wanted a girl to like me. Now more than ever before after I finished firefighting training and had my first \"psychologically demanding\" firecalls. Sometimes I just come home and wish that a girl would just come out of nowhere and hug me. I am still a kissless virgin even though from the outside I may even be desireable. At least thats what some people tell me. But because most of my life there weren't really any girls that were nice to me, I interpret every single nice thing from a girl as some kind of flirt. Then I get feelings for almost every single girl there was. They could be as bitchy as anything but as long as they're a woman, I would develop feelings for her and make advances. Openly flirting with almost every girl I knew. I was sort of known as the needy guy. Some people told me and I slowly realised that I had no chance with girls if I act like this. Then one of my \"favorite crushes\" (there are a lot of them) had a long talk to me. I told her how I felt about my needyness and my past. She told me I dont have any chance with her (she told me before) but that if I stopped thinking about girls all the time then maybe someone would actually turn up. That was the first time I really talked to someone about my problem and it was devastating. I couldn't stop thinking about women. For years when I'm home alone I'd pretend that there was a girl in my bed. Asking how \"her\" day was, making out with the pillow and everything. Sometimes at dinner I would put two plates on the table and just talk with \"her\" about \"her\" day. I didn't know how to help myself and because of all my volunteering work and sports I don't have time for a therapist. So then I had the idea of punishing myself if I'd think about women. And with no other ideas I started doing that. Every day I'd take my leather belt, take off my top and start belting away at my back. I'd take my phone and turn on porn and start belting myself so I would stop getting an erection when something sexual happens. At school and volunteering work I'd pinch my trizeps real hard whenever I'd think about women or would look at a girls butt or breasts. Now everytime I see a girl I'd just catch a glimpse of her and quickly look away. In the beginning it helped. I stopped thinking about girls. But after some time I was on edge all the time. Hurting myself at the slightest thought of someone. I'd look at women at firecalls or when I otherwise needed to. But otherwise I'd look away. And now it just hurts. My confidence has plumeted. I'm looking at the ground the whole time. I have spots on my back and arms. I am feeling like shit all day. Tired and with no motivation for anything anymore.

Anyways I\u2019ve been in therapy 3 times over the last 15 years and quite honestly it\u2019s been a disaster each time, I\u2019m to the point where I no longer believe in psychotherapy as a legitimate means to help myself.\n\nThis recent bout has started late October and has been moving into the severe, life affecting depression the last two months. It\u2019s made much worse by having to look my wife and precious children in the eyes everyday knowing I\u2019m failing them. My wonderful children 2.5 and 1 year old bring me so much joy but then so much anxiety that I am failing them, wasting my life in a malaise with no real impending problems. \n\nProbably the worst part is people who know me but don\u2019t live with me would never know this, even when depressed I can fake it in social situations and I would say people think I\u2019m funny, personable and when I\u2019m not depressed I have a keen mind and have had some mild success in business or other endeavors.

So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening.

I have done that since I was a kid and I\u2019m now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I don\u2019t know what I want and like partly due to the depression.

I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven\u2019t done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn\u2019t hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. It\u2019s fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad.

But the damage was already done, i started school a pretty normal happy kid with a fair few friends who didnt think about much besides what pokemon i needed to catch to fill my national dex or if i the cartoon i wanted to watch was recorded but by my last year i was could barely be bothered to do anything, i didnt talk to anyone i simply went to school and got the bus home and avoided people at all costs, i had skipped way too much school to get good grades and i could motivate myself to want to study, i was getting the bare minimum to get into 6th form and hopefully that was enough to scrape by. But as if things wern't bad enough i went on a residential school trip with one of my classes that was cut short because I ended up having a severe athsma attack when we got the the accommodation camp, this was my first time having an athsma attack and my first time i'd have ever been to hospital and i was only 15 so my first feelings were obviously of extreme panic, a small part of me i'd say was honestly relieved, maybe this was the end and i wouldnt have to go on, the ambulance got there and i must have asked the responded a hundred times if i was going to die, obviously she cant tell a child 'probably' so she said no and was comforting me, the ride to the hospital felt like an eternity. To wrap this part up obviously i didnt die but i had woken up a week later in the icu surrounded by my family, it was weird seeing my dad and mum together as well as their partners because they had been split up for a long time but i was just happy i woke up i guess. I had to stay in hospital for a few days more after i woke up for tests and rehab, getting used to walking again after being in bed for a week was interesting and a lot harder than i ever thought it would be, i was told that people who suffer acute asthma attacks generally have a low survival rate, i cant remember the exact number but it was low enough to cause a reaction from everyone. We left the hospital and i was told i wouldnt be able to go back to school for at least a month, obviously any kid would be thrilled to hear that but i was super happy because it meant time away from hell on earth. \n\nHowever the recovery process during that month kind of set the precedent for a hole i got trapped in and am still trapped in, doing nothing for a month meant i got into some pretty lazy habits but also i got used to being on my own world just playing xbox and watching tv during the day. Transitioning back into school life was harder than anticipated because it was half days to start off with and that was for about 2 weeks. Fast forward a bit and the bullying starts again because fuck it why not bully the kid fresh out of hospital right? it gets to exam period and i have full on sacked off school, i skip most days and get put into the assisted education program where you take exams in a different room and have a personal TA and some counselling sessions, of course none of this really helped me because i just didnt have any care for my education i just wanted away from school asap. I by some miracle without studying at all managed to scrape by with enough GCSE qualifications to go to 6th form on the condition that i would have to take english and maths alongside a foundation year. This leads onto my next problem:\n\nFor more reasons unknown to me which i can only chalk up to she cant be bothered, my mum decided for me that i wasnt going to go to a college in my hometown, i would have to instead go to live with my dad and do my 3 years of college there. Now i should probably explain why this is a problem, my dad and I dont get on well, we havent for as long as i stopped being a child and we still have barely any real relationship, i just talk to him like once a month to talk to my little brother and sister who obviously i have no reason to not have a relationship with. I wont go into as much detail here because this post is already feeling too long but theres so much more to get through. Long story short my dad was extremely emotionally abusive, anything that he didnt like would be met with screaming banging on things and threats of physical violence, this would be for anything from not doing the dishes to not studying earlier than what was on my plan. This again warped my view of education because i wasnt really doing courses i enjoyed but rather what was available to me and i didnt feel inspired to commit to it by studying, most of my study time was just sneaking my phone on silent. This went on for 3 years straight, i was isolated, the only person i really interacted with was my abusive dad and my teachers and classmates when i had to. When i tried to confide in my mother she simply told me other people including herself had it worse and hes just strict and does it because he cares about me and wants whats best. So i gave up on that as well. Throughout my life one of the few things i really enjoyed was playing video games and I used it as an escape to just ignore my real life situation and responsibilities, how healthy that is is up for debate but if i didnt have that escape who knows if i'd even be typing this here now. He didn't like that i played video games because he said that it was pointless and took away time i could be studying or looking for work, so he took it away and never let me have it back on any occasion after half of the first year. \n\nThats when things got really bad for me, without something to pass the time and take my mind off of things my depression and suicidal tendencies came flooding back, i started self harming and i still look at the scars along my arms sometimes and get reminded of how bad things were back then, i never thought that they would still be there 6 years later, i wish i had thought about that. Somehow 3 years later again without really putting in any effort i managed to complete my A levels and get enough points to get into University. on a foundation entry degree, I guess this was when i was happiest because i was finally free from my parents and maybe i could be someone new and different, I never would have imagined myself where I am now 4 years ago.\n\nUni life started off fine, i was still avoiding people and keeping to myself but a couple of people on my course would always sit next to me and try to talk to me, I guess because seeing someone sitting on their own in their first year of Uni made them want to include me so i even managed to have friends, the first year had some hardships because i was never taught how to budget or be independent so of course money got tight towards the end but aside from that i don't think my first year had any issues, i passed without any issues and found myself advancing to the first year of the actual degree. I wont go into detail for every year but i'll just say that apart from the odd times we'd go out together I still mostly stayed in my flat playing games or watching stuff online, I didnt party and I didnt study, I just kind of drifted, then for whatever reason i cannot remember i got into an argument with my mum, i cant remember what about but she sent me a message saying that she was done with me and i didnt really know what to feel, I just kind of stopped, I stopped going to uni, i stopped going out i stopped everything, i just started spending every day waking up, playing games and eating junk food, sleep, repeat. As you can imagine having a lifestyle like this really did a number on my mental and physical health. I would go an entire week without showering sometimes more, my only human contact was taking my food from downstairs, this was my lowest point. \n\nObviously i failed the year because i didnt attend or do all the work. The next year i was allowed to stay at the Uni and take up a different course, thinking that i could just power through it, but apparently during all of this student finance (the company that pays your tuition fees) turned around and said they wouldn't fund this year of learning for me, which obviously kind of fucked me over completely. Because they told me I wouldn't be funded i decided that there was no point in going, because i certainly don't have 9k just laying around to pay the fees myself, I didn't attend a single lecture all year and lived the same unhealthy life i had lived towards the end of the previous year for the entire year, it was horrible. The one beacon of hope that i could find was that eventually i had to start benefits as i didnt get money to pay the rent or anything so that covered that, meanwhile there was a local game store that ran a tournament for the game a play and i really enjoyed going to that once a week and made friends with the team i was assigned to, my life finally felt like it had some form of normality, i had a decent friend group, i was finally going out and i had something to look forward to whilst i tried to find proper work to fill my time and move into my own place, but unfortunately i couldnt find work and it came time to decide what i was going to do next in the summer, at this time i had another argument with my mum because she began to catch on that clearly something was wrong and i didnt want to go to university and do a degree i had no interest in.\n\nWe hadn't spoken in almost a month and i was sure we had cut ties but then she messaged me pleading me to come to an open day for a course that did in all honestly sound extremely appealing to me so i went and the place seemed nice and this where I am now, i got onto the course and i'm currently here now in the same situation but worse that i was in for the 3rd year at the previous uni, i havent attended almost any of the classes i'm almost certainly going to be kicked out or have to retake the year, but thats not even the worst part, the worst part is that i'm still being asked to pay for other years that i was told would be funded including this year, meaning i'm in an insane amount of debt with no way to pay it off, this year also isn't being funded despite being told it would be and i'm currently in negative balance in my bank account with the next payment of my underfunded maintenance loan coming in on the 20th of next month, i havent eaten in 3 days already and i dont feel all that good, my parents aren't an option and i have tried to ask for help in the loans/assistance reddits but i got marked as a scammer because i wasn't getting any replies but kept trying, I don't know what to do, I think I am well and truly ready for the end, I don't see how I can recover from this hole i put myself into, I'm 23 years old, with no degree, debt, no work experience meaning i cant get any jobs despite the 100's of applications i've probably sent off by now, i've never had a romantic partner, hell i've never even had a real best friend, i'm completely alone and I don't think anyone will miss me when i'm gone.\n\nI'm sorry this was such a long read, but I don't have anyone else to talk to and really explain things to, so this is my last resort, I dont think i want to die, but i really don't see how I can live on.", "When you are so depressing that nobody replies to your posts, even on r/depression And you start to notice people you know dont really listen to you anymore.

And whoever you believe yourself to be right now that is not true. remember the person you were when you were fine, happy, in a better place. Feel it, embody that. I know that I am holding on to it. And if life has been mostly dark it helps to believe that experiences of happiness and joy exist somewhere outside of this state...just like Martin Luther king believed in his dreams even at that particular time it seemed impossible.\n\nI do not know what caused you to land hard in this state, for me it was relationship loss, failure, deep loneliness and isolation-I have no family and lost my relationship/friendships to depression- people left-, though life circumstances (financial issues/living environment and of course the abusive childhood) AND my reactions to them e.g. blaming myself, self-sabotage, feeling futile, discouraged, bad habits, unhelpful implicit relational and emotional patterns that keep repeating. Whatever it is that led into this black hole. I guess the situation gets more frustrating with every attempt to heal that did not work. I tried many medications (almost all of them), several psychiatric stays, several years of therapy (CBT, depth psychology), the Hoffmann process, all kinds of meditations, body work, \u201cgiving up and surrender\u201d, Eckhart tolle etc you name it.. they all helped a little but nothing really worked in the long term.\n\nAnd it sucks that nothing seem to work permanently. \n\nHowever, I deeply believe that there is meaning imprinted in everyone\u2019s heart.

I feel like I don't deserve it.\n\nTonight I looked outside the window at the world as I often do throughout the day. I thought to myself: the people that I have met, all of them, all of the people I have come across... does anyone of them ever think of me? Ever? Do they ever wonder how I am? Even just for a second? If they did, I wish I knew, because I feel like a shadow living life alone inside my house day after day. \n\nAt the same time I feel that I am unworthy of friendship, community, love. Today at therapy my therapist asked me my goals. I said... to have a friend and to be a part of a small community that truly cared for me. But I have never felt or experienced that. I only know what friendships and loving communities are like from observing others. I truly pity anyone who would want to befriend me, because I think I would make the worst friend.", "wtf what is with the assholes on here telling people to kill themselves or that their worthless.

My sister took her frustrations on me, was being bullied at school gor not having a functional family, my father distanced himself from us... life generally sucked. I was also getting (at the time undiagnosed) migraines, which my sis and dad kept insisting that I'm lying about for attention, was even punished for it. So I stoped talking. After a long 2 years, my mother had applied for divorce, mainly due to my father's threats and mental abuse. By what I saw, my father was threatening my mother to throw me and my sis in the streets if she didn't send more money. The divorce was messy and a lot of shit throwing at eachother. It ended with my sis insisting that we need to stick toghether and since she was older, she insisted that we stay in my home country with my dad, also to spite my mother, who she now hated. The next years were rough, a lot of screaming, bullying, hitting, starving... list is long. (Just on a side note, I ended up climbing trees from windows to grab aome nasty fruit for my class mates and trading them and homework for sandwiches. Did I care I was millimeters away from dying, NAH!) Highschool was worse with the bulying, mom was still away but now, she had someone (she met the guy before the divorce, but I can't blame her. She was alone in a country where my people were, and still are, very hated). We tried to get mom to get cuatody of me, but for reasons I still can't wrap my head around, it failed. Well, her (now) husband lost his crap, and kept repeating to me and making me feel like pure shit because the process failed. It did fail because of me, yes, but as I said previously, I still don't remember why I said what I said and what happened. Years later, they decide to go to a better place, Australia! After 4 years of struggles and 3 lost cases, I finally get to get my (20 y/o) ass there with my mother. I get a boyfriend, her husband turns out to be the dickhead of the year and, long story short, I get kicked out of the house after only 1 year living with them, and end up with extremely severe anxiety because of him.\n\nThis year I turned 24. I still live with my boyfriend, who took me in. But here is where the problem is. I want to end it. So much stuff is going on, and all I can say is that it's too much. I was diagnosed (discovered by accident) with clinical depression at the age of 16, and was never addressed. I always felt like something was wrong, but every time I tried to look for help, was told to suck it up by the counselors and psycologists (admittedly, I only worked the courage to go 3 times in my life).\n\nBut in the past 3 years, I felt lost. I've been depressed and can't seem to get over it. I find no joy in life or any of the things I used to love. I have no reason, energy or motivation to move on. I drive to work, I work, put a fake smile, drive back, sleep, agrue, sleep, repeat. I feel so angry all the time, I ended hating myself more than ever, and I don't know why! I feel my partner is not there, he's stuck in his games and not engaging, and I think this is because I put too much pressure on him. I can't see my mother to talk to her, my sister doesn't talk to me and I had to go full no contact with my father. And whenever anyone asks me how I am, all I can do is repeat \"I'm fine\" and smile. I hate it... I hate it all....\n\nSorry for putting this all out, but I had enough of this. I want to smile, to enjoy things, but I can't... I need help. I knew I had to write this after I watched some reddit reading and was crying like an idiot at how accurate and true the things said in said reading were (the topic was \"What do you wish more people knew about depression\")\n\nOnce again, I'm sorry for taking your time, but if you read it all, thank you. Thank you so much for listening.\n\nAlso, dear moderators, if this is not in accordince to the rules, please do delete it. Thank you.", "I was feeling better I finally decided to reach out for help 4 months ago, started taking meds and going to psychotherapy, but these last  two weeks I've been feeling really down just like the usual, I'm struggling to get up from bed to the point I end up skipping morning classes, I can't focus, I don't want to be around anyone and I just can't stop thinking about how worthless are the efforts I made these last 4 months and how nice it would be to die", "No more feeling shitty I changed my diet and it helped me within a day or two!

If would be great if you could direct me to the right subreddit.\n\nEnglish is not my first language so please bear with me.\n\n**TL:DR**\nI have done a lot of reading when I procrastinate from work. I want to start a daily journal on reddit to keep track of my positives and negatives, my progress, and hopefully get advices on when I go wrong. \nI noticed that I get overtly stressed over tiny chores/work/things to do, and I'd like to tackle it via progressive increase in exposure and desensitization. Then incorporate other CBT techniques.\n\n***Story/Background:***\n\nI have only recently been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after a close friend forced me to. Looking back now, I think I first had mild depression around 16yo.\nI recall having a general apathy towards life, results, ambition, family, and friends. Any motivation is fleeting and I'd spend most of my days daydreaming. Perhaps hoping for some catastrophe in the school so that I'm no longer bored.\nThe depression seemingly subsided - at least I think so - as I continued on aimlessly on some path my family/culture/friends expected of me. while I'm not excelling, I'm not underperforming. I have close group of friends and we enjoy movies and outings.\nIt all went to hell when I was around 22/23yo. I should add that I have Contamination OCD and during my University days, decided against my better judgement that I should live with a close friend.\nThis proved horrible as my OCD meant I couldn't live normally or telerate their habits. I thought I had it in control and hid my oddities well. I didn't. \n\nMy housemates at the time hated me and talked loads behind my back. All the while I was oblivious about their hatred towards me while they acted normal around me. I noticed somewhere around 3 months in. I had the chance to look through their messages and curiousity started my depression.\nReading through all those hate filled complaints and messages was painful. Having to sleep in the same room as him after was impossivle. To act civil while I moved out was tough. While we did not have a big fight because we both hated confrontation,\nour 6year friendship fell apart; along with it, I resolutely cut ties with the entire group of friends that was associated with this guy. \n\nI believe this to be the \"event\" which kickstarted my depression. Worse still, I moved to a different place and had another falling out with another group of housemates. We started off great, even went on a trip together. In about two months, I don't recall the cause of it. But I remember they confronted me on something and I just started withdrawing from them. \nAfter that, I stopped going to lectures and classes. I was fired from my club because I couldn't perform anymore. (I spent the first year making it into the committee), As a result, I graduated with a subpar GPA. I've never felt worse. I feel like I disaappointed my dad, wasted his money, and failed to prove myself to those who looked down on me.\nI spent the next two years isolating myself in my room, only going out for groceries if I absolutely have to. I avoided the housemates by being active at odd hours. I lied to my family that I was trying and failing to apply for jobs while the truth is I mindlessly watched seasons after seasons of brainless TV. \nI am eternally thankful that my dad supported me through this lie. He paid for my rent, food, and courses I took because I wanted to extend my visa. Oh, I was also an international student so you can imagine how much money that costed. \nI cannot begin to describe the amount of guilt I feel. \n\nThe reason I'm even trying to get better is because of guilt. My main motivation is to make them proud of me.\n\nWhen I was 27, I spent a year dodging their concerned calls. They were so worried they sent a friend over to check on me. And finally, they took a flight over themselves. My visa finally expired and I went home.\nAfter getting home, I once again lied to them about job searching and spent a year doing my best to avoid family events and outings. Finally, last year they forcefully got me a job with my relatives and I've feel into a routine since then.\nI majored in Finance and Accounting in Uni. But my results were subpar and it has been 3-4years at this point. I barely remember a thing and I can't perform. I can't even get myself to pick the knowledge back up. \nAdmittedly though, the work I perform doesn't require that much. But alas, I fail to perform. I find it difficult to get myself to issue a simple invoice which takes 5muinutes tops. \n\nI am more and more disappointed in myself over time. I hate the job, but I haven't even sent out a single resume. The very thought of going for interviews and exposing myself as incompetent frightens me. GEtting judged by anonymous HR people makes me hate myself.\nI contemplated all kinds of alternatives ie: getting a remote part time job so that I can make extra income while improving myself. Taking courses online and hopefully put me ahead of others.\nUltimately though, I have not brought myself to do any of those things. Even this reddit post took 5days of contemplating before I could do it.\n\nI know what I should do, and people will say \"you never know if you never try\" but I can't help but imagine the negatives. Posting for help on reddit for example opens me up to judgement from random strangers, trolls, even scams, some of them incredibly damaging. \nImproving myself via courses/books/lectures can be an enormous time sink. Not to mention that what is learned may not even be useful to me in the future and may end up being a waste of time.\nCurrently, I spend the measly 4 hours of free time I get after getting back from work watching movies or reading novels. They're not entertaining nor boring, but they keep me sane. I dread the day that they are taken away. \n\n\n***Analysis:***\n\nGrowing up, I've been instilled with the idea that I am smart, but lazy. I believe this became a part of my core identify. I'm 29 and I don't recall ever working hard, for anything. \nI've coasted through life however, largely because my parents made me go to numerous additional tuitions, cram classes, etc. I've never done homework, mostly copied them off of friends, but have the concept repeated to you enough times and it gets carved into memory.\nMy results up till 15yo were always above average. \n\nI believe due to the circumstances, I grew up without developing any self-discipline skills. Never having an aim or goal and simply going through the motions meant I was lost the moment those guidance were taken away. Believing myself to be smart also creates a subconcious anxiety - what if I worked hard but still failed? that would mean I'm not smart.\n\nThroughout life, I have had a panic attack twice. Once when I was 10. An art project which took me 20minutes tops was criticised and I broke down in tears and hyperventilated, having to be taken home from school.\nThe next was when I was 16. Around this time, I was getting progessively more apathetic at school. I struggled to get up in the morning and was often late to school. I was late for 10 times and my parents were called to school which resulted in me hyperventilating once again.\nI also spent a lot of time gaming which I believe was some sort of coping mechanism similar to mindlessly watching youtube or browsing reddit. \n\nNot entirely sure what these events mean. But I think I can conclude that I have an inability to accept criticism or face consequences of my own actions. \n\n***What I want to do:***\n\nAs stated above, I want to tackle my self-disclipline, responsibility avoidance, and anxiety towards work, via progressively increasing exposure. \nI will practice mindful relaxation and attempt to associate the relaxation with the trigger(work).\nI will also journal on reddit. 1. To have accountability, 2. to further dissect my thoughts, analyze the issues, solve them. and 3. to get advice.    \n\n\nThank you for reading this far. Or if you skipped, thanks anyways for your time. I may have left out some details or major events in life, I'm not entirely sure and I'm too tired to go back and check.", "Rock Bottom So I\u2019ve suffered some heavy depression for a long time, my ex that I absolutely loved to the max just got along so well, she was so gorgeous, caring, loving and nice.

Hi everyone, this is my first time posting in this thread so bare with me. \n\nSo I\u2019ve been suffering from depression on and off for years, I\u2019m currently in an off cycle but feel kind of down/low energy but not enough for me to call it depressed. Anyway, I somehow completely forgot about music and haven\u2019t listened to it for months. I commute on the bus, and I usually just sit and browse reddit, and when my bf drives me the radio is usually off because I get sensory overload if he tries to talk while the radio is on, so we usually just keep it off. \n\nAnyway, yesterday when I went in the car the Bluetooth function was on as I guess my bf was listening to his music on his way home from work, and it automatically connected to my phone and started playing my music. It was a song by the Jonas brothers (embarrassing) from like 2008, and it just made me so so happy and I started vibing so hard before I had to start work. I seriously forgot about music.

My Mom was never stable, and my birthday was no exception. She'd would either view my birthday as a burden or if I didn't react in a specific way to something she would do for my birthday, she'd act as if the world collapsed around her and make a huge deal about how I don't appreciate her and she's a bad parent. (Maybe I'm just un-greatful like I've always been told) Regardless. As far back as I can remember, I've never had a good birthday. I recall vividly having a birthday party as a child, no one wanted to really play with me at my party. And I tried to isolate myself at a table when the cake was being cut (it didn't go over well with my Mom, she scalded me in front of everyone).\n\n As birthdays go by, all I remember are sighs, moans, and groans whenever mentioned. Last year no one wished me a happy birthday (family yes, but if history shows they don't really care) my Mom said I should celebrate her on my birthday because she's the one that gave birth to me.\n Later on I went to a pub I knew I could get into, and tried to get drunk but could barley manage. I had never felt so alone in a room of people, and it's not like it's a place I'm unfamiliar with, I knew the regulars, the regulars knew me, we're all well aquatinted. Yet still, I had never felt more alone. I ended up contacting a mate that sells me pot and got high with my weed guy. He's the only person that genuinely wished me a Happy Birthday outside my family.\n\n Flashforward to present day, life is pretty decent, my business is doing well, I have an album releasing soon, I have a clean bill of health (for the most part) but the realization set in...\n\nMy friend (we'll call him J) is talking in the group chat I'm in,  saying he wants to do social stuff soon, and I tell him that (we'll call him B) B and I are going to do stuff Friday and we could go out and do something all together. The chat goes cold. \n\nTime passes. \n\nMoments later, someone else in the chat (we'll call him C) says \"we should all do something Friday\"...everyone lights up with agreeing with him. B then enters the chat and says my birthday is Saturday and \"we should be going out Friday for Matt\". C responds with \"that's fine\". Then everything hits me, I feel like a burden again, they probably didn't want to hangout with me, and now that B said something they feel obligated... \n\nI told them  \"We don't have to for me\" \"I would rather you guys have a full night\". The chats been silent since. I'm a burden, people probably hangout with me because they feel morally obligated.

For some background, I am now living back in my home state, in an unhappy situation, because I wanted to come back and finish up school and so that I could be around my family.\n\nOriginally, I moved away for a few years. I was unhappy before I left my home, and I found real happiness out west in Colorado for a time. I began traveling around, working seasonal jobs at ski resorts and in national parks, and I really enjoyed it for awhile. I just wanted to keep traveling, but then the realities of life set in.\n\nI didn't have a degree, I wasn't in any sort of high-paying jobs, and I was struggling to make it paycheck to paycheck. Despite all of this, I was still relatively happy. Eventually though, I realized that I missed my family and my old friends terribly, and decided to move back so that I could be around them and get an education.\n\nFast forward to now. I'm 26 years old, living at my dad's house, working in an unfulfilling job that pays terribly, while I wait for my first semester of school to start. I feel like an absolute failure because I won't even have a degree until I'm 30. I won't start my career until almost a decade after everyone else did. I miss what I was doing and the places I traveled through so terribly much. I feel like I'm missing a part of myself by being back here and I left it out west.\n\nI have considered moving back, but I have no idea how I would afford it, and I don't see any career opportunities for me outside of dead-end, low paying jobs out there. Also, if I don't do school now, then I don't think I ever will. If I moved back out, I would just go back to seeing my family once a year for two or three days, and I love them so much. That was the hardest part of being out there, and I want to be able to see them regularly. I'm extremely close to my parents, and I don't want to miss a moment with them, because I realize that they will be gone some day. Every moment with them is precious.\n\nBut, I feel like I'm slowly dying here. I am turned into a depressed, cynical person who cannot see the good in life anymore. Everything is negative, and the people around me in this state are so ignorant and offensive. I don't belong here, and I don't know what to do. Grappling with this indecision has been so unbelievably hard on me.\n\nIf I stay, then I will just become more and more unhappy. If I leave, then I will never be able to see my parents, and I will be unhappy again because of that. I can't take it anymore. Looking ahead, my life seems like it is going to be one endless stream of depression and I honestly just want it to end.\n\nPlease, help me. I don't know what to do anymore and it feels like I'm going insane just battling with my own thoughts all day", "Changing thought patterns via therapy different than wishing away depression? I have never understood the distinction between therapy like CBT which tries to train you to think more positively to reduce or eliminate depression, which is sort of the underlying belief of most psychology thinking, versus the sentiment that one cannot think themselves out of depression. \n\nCould someone explain to me how these two sides can reconcile with each other?", "Finally made an appointment with my GP So for the past year and a half I've not been doing well. Certain traumatic events happened that had a lot more impact on me than I realized they did in the moment. This paired with health issues has me becoming more and more depressed and the good moments are far and between.\n\nThis is what made finally take this step because I could not go on the way I was just existing. So we will see if this is a good step in the direction of finally getting better.", "I (19M) feel like I'm reaching a breaking point. I've been feeling depressed af the last few months, it sort of feels like a relapse after about 6 months of a reasonably healthy mental state.\n\nBasically I feel physically drained of energy all day, I have zero motivation to study or try in any way whatsoever in college. I'm doing a notoriously tough course and barely passed my Christmas exams. I come home exhausted but when I go to bed I just become really agitated and irritated. My heart starts pounding and I struggle to breathe, I can't get comfortable and even if go to bed exhausted at 8/9pm I wouldn't get to sleep until 2/3am.  However in the mornings I struggle so much to get out of bed, I feel like there's almost zero point getting up anyway as I wouldn't even miss out on anything. I end up missing so many of my lectures simply becuase I cannot bring myself to get out of bed. I still live at home going to college but if I lived by myself without parents I could see myself just staying in bed/my room for days at a time. \n\nEvery day passes by in a sort of blur for me, I feel like I almost have a depersonalization disorder as I just operate in autopilot. I feel like a shell, it's almost like I'm just empty inside; I don't feel emotions, everything just feels monotonous and numb.  Honestly I really just don't give a fuck about anything anymore. I used to have passions like playing music/sport/reading/films etc but nothing excites me anymore. I feel like I don't really have an emotional outlet, it's like I'm just existing day-to-day without actually living. Since I find close to zero pleasure in general life I self-medicate with weed; I guess it's just a coping mechanism in order to feel something other than numb. I also think I have memory loss, as the last couple months have really blurred, I honestly don't know where the time has gone or what I've been doing in that time. \n\nI also have really really bad eating habits, I don't generally eat breakfast and then could go the day without eating. However when I come home I often would binge until I struggle to breathe. \n\nI also feel socially exhausted every day I have to go into college; pretending to be someone I'm not is mentally draining as I feel like I'm putting on a fake persona just to mask the numbness when all I wanna do is just go to bed/get high. This is probably part of the reason I avoid going to lectures. \n\nThis all eventually caused me to go to the student couseling services in my college sometime last week, however I feel like I wasnt as honest as I should have been regarding my situation, I was definitely making it out to be less severe than it actually is. They set me up with counselling sessions that start in 3 weeks. \n\nHowever I feel like my ability to function has been severely impaired in the last few days. Tonight I felt the urge to self-harm for the first time and honestly if I had clean razors I would already have done so. I don't think I can wait 3 weeks for my counselling appointment, I feel like I should go to a GP/psychiatrist and see what they think. I feel like I just want someone to tell me exactly what I have, I'm 99% sure it's depression, and perhaps symptomatic  insomnia/a binge eating disorder. I guess part of me still denies it's depression despite me knowing that it almost certainly is and I feel like I need a medical professional to tell me how it is in order for me to be able to work on getting better. I guess I also want to see if they think that medication could help too. Ultimately I just want treatment as soon as possible, something concrete I can show to myself to tell me that I'm taking steps to improve myself as atm I feel so lost in life, and I feel like a breakingpoint might come soon unless I change things. \n\nI really don't know where to go from here, I guess this post is just a reflection. Maybe I just want to get my thoughts down somewhere but if anyone has any advice obviously I'd rly appreciate that: like most ppl here I just wanna feel normal again. :( If anyone would be willing to talk about things a bit more in detail I'd appreciate a pm.", "I don't do anything I've got a lot of work to do, but I can't do anything. The voice in my head says that even if I tried, I wouldn't get anywhere, I wouldn't succeed. That's why I always delay things, even though I have to do it at that time. The worst part is that I'm aware of this situation, and I'm still not doing anything about it. Time's going too fast and idk what to do. My anxiety gets worse at times like this and when it gets worse, I can't even sleep, let alone do anything.\n\nI'm so tired of feeling this way, but like I said, I don't know what to do. I don't have anyone to talk to and I really need advice.\n[English is not my first language, so I hope you can understand]", "Disappointed Disappointed\nThat's the one word I would use to sum up the way I feel. Disappointed in everything. \n\nMyself, for being...mediocre. That's the only word that comes to mind when I consider my life. I've been given so many gifts and people that love me, and I waste it all. I don't quite understand what's wrong with me, but I know there's something not clicking right in my brain. People talk about a certain fire behind someone's eyes, a drive that pushes them to work hard for their goals. I dont have that. I'm not passionate about anything. I find myself with no motivation to do anything, even doing days without eating. Some days I'll be how I used to, full of energy and making people laugh, but, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. I'm back to laying in bed all day, not speaking to anyone, not doing anything that I'm not required to. The only thing that impresses me anymore is how easily I lie to my own family. As soon as they call, I become this other person. The person they want me to be, who does well in school and never had any issues. \n\nI don't feel joy anymore. Not a trace of genuine happiness, other than the aforementioned 'good days'. Even the things that used to make me happiest, like Christmas, now just seem annoying and pointless. I can't sleep, often laying awake for hours on end. \n\nFuck, I miss him. I miss my Da. I would give anything in the world for 5 more minutes with him. He was everything to me, my whole world. I loved him with everything in me. You could come to him in the worst possible situation, and he would tell you what you needed to hear, and you would always come away feeling better. But now he's gone. He left, leaving a mess that my family has yet to fix, and now I'll never see him again. Never hug him, or hear his roaring laughter. I'll never again have him look me in the eyes and say \"I'm proud of you, son.\" And that breaks my heart. Sometimes I go back and listen to old voicemails, just to hear his voice. \n\nI'm disappointed in my family, some more than others. We all came together as a family for the funeral, and not even 24 hours later they're already fighting. I don't understand what I have to do to let them know I need help. I shouldn't be too hard on them, but if my friend who hasn't seen me in 3 years can discern I'm struggling over the phone, surely my own family could tell. I told them I wasn't ready to go back, that I couldn't handle it, but they didn't listen. I've never once in my life had real freedom. Freedom to choose what I want. Thats not exactly true. Theres 2 options: do what they want, or be on my own. \n\nDisappointed in those around me. Now, I could never blame anyone here for my problems, but damn if they can't tell. There are people here who's job it is to identify people who are struggling. They haven't approached me, nor have any of my 'friends' here. I went to the counselor once, and after an hour of talking, he told me that he thought my Das death might have had an impact on me. No shit. Say what you will about my high school, but I'm more comfortable telling anyone there that I'm struggling than I ever would be here. \n\nI don't know where something went wrong, where I lost my drive, but I want to fix it. I want to be happy again, but every day that seems farther away. Every day, I feel less like myself and I just want it to end.", "The only time when I feel fine is when I sleep When I am awake my anxiety is there every moment, and it can be overwhelming. I feel my heart beating faster and my breathing becomes a mess, I just feel my whole body feel uncomfortable when I am awake. The only time where I don't feel panic, where I don't feel as much negative feelings, is when I lie in bed and my mind is getting ready to sleep. I don't know how long it takes to fall asleep, but if it took 10 minutes, then those 10 minutes is the best I ever felt in the whole day. I know that its not good to sleep so much, but I understand why some people would choose to sleep a lot when they are depressed. I look forward to that peaceful 10 minutes.

To wishing you were brave enough to tell other how you're feeling? To reach out for help? But at the same time, feeling hurt because nobody seems to care? To want someone to look into your eyes and see the sadness and tell you it's going to be okay? For the ones 'closest' to you to hear the lie in your laugh? To feel alone? Abandoned? Like you'll never be happy again? To be so scared that you'll feel this sad and lonely forever?

Even the few people I've shared my feelings with are nowhere to be seen. What's the point in sharing if nobody cares? Because nobody cares, right? I think it's pretty obvious at this point. So what do you do when you have no support system?  No one in your corner to encourage you? To fight for you? To fight FOR you? When there's no one to tell you 'it's going to be okay'?

I've been in and out of college, failing out two different times taking breaks from classes once or twice. I've had on and off addiction problems with alcohol during this time.. basically I've been trying to get a bachelor's degree for 7 years. The last 4 years of college has caused me soo much stress. My parents are wealthy and not to say they are at fault in any way for my failire but they have sort of enabled me financially  to keep trying to get a degree. Ive wasted probly around $100,000 dollars on failed/withdrawn classes. My sister deeply resents me for this. I have an insane amount of guilt for this too even though my parents say they would pay anything and help me in any way they can for me to graduate. \n\nSo after all that, i made it to my final semester b4 graduation. Im only taking 2 classes but i might fail 1 of them and that would result in my 3rd and final academic dismissal, meaning i wount get a degree cause of a flunk in my final semester. I just dont understand why i cant just sit here and do my homework and actually care. My problem is i dont give a crap about anything unless i have an innate desire or interest in it. Like my motivation is just 0 in anything thats academic i dont understand why!\n\nSo after all this.. even if i do pass and graduate i feel like im so broken, endured so much stress by the age of 26 that i feel like just a vegetable now.  i cant fathom myself using my business degree to get a \"real job\"  i dont know if ill ever be able to get over the idea that i spent over 250,000 dollars on a degree and i have no desiree to work a normal job because i feel like my brain is this empty void that only seeks pleasure and has no purpose or drive. On the surface, im a happy bubbly person. Im outgoing and very sociable. I feel deep down i really have alot of potential but im soooo lost and so easily overwhelmed by everything. I feel the slightest bit of resistance and i just shut down mentally and seek pleasure in the form of leisure activity or alcohol. \n\nIdk where im even going with this.. sorta just letting it all out i guess because i have nobody to talk too.

I don't think there's something on my mind making me worried, I'm just feeling weird inside and I can't pinpoint what's the problem.

I broke up with my bf about a year and a half ago, after being together 4 years. Throughout our relationship he was often depressed, angry at everything, narcissistic, extremely anxious, would go through phases of not eating, etc. I tried helping as much as I could and encouraging he get help (which he did a few times, on and off seeing a therapist) but it never worked.\n\nI had to cut off our relationship because it just became \"too much\". He would blame me for his carelessness, would get annoyed if I offered help in any way, and was just constantly negative. I just often didn't feel loved, and without ranting his mental health issues were stressful as I tried and tried to help him and it felt useless.\n\nWhen we broke up I didn't feel the need to block him but did not want to be \"friends\" or really ever have any communication any more. Since we broke up, he has texted me here and there that he's suicidal, hates everyone, screams at himself, has no reason to live, etc. He told me that since I broke up with him he would kill himself, but i took that more so as manipulation. I would text him trying to help, offering advice, and so on, which was mentally draining because any time I'd try and help he'd continue texting things like \"I'm just gonna kill myself\". I have told him so many times he needs professional help and by doing so will improve his mental health. \n\nHe's nearly 30 and has barely held a job because he \"hates all the managers\" wherever he works and continuously drops out of school to sit at home and be handed money by his mom and play PS4 all day. When I encourage finding a different job or so on he gets offended and tells me I'm a \"slave\" because I have a full time job.\n\nI've since entered a new relationship with someone I love very much. When my ex randomly occasionally texts me (he texts me probably once every 10-15 days) saying he wants to kill himself I panic and reply and try to help. I told my current bf about helping my ex and he was understandably upset. I know I need to stop communication with my ex but I worry by telling him we need to stop talking he actually will kill himself. I have told a close friend this and they told me if he doesn't want to accept help or seek any help, and kills himself, at least I tried and there was nothing more I could do. \n\nThe other day at work I checked my phone and had a ton of missed texts from him saying he was going to kill himself  &amp; that he has no reason to live anymore. All the texts made me panic terribly, I had to leave work because I started crying and ended up calling suicide prevention (they were beyond unhelpful) because I know he needs help. After 4 years of hearing him talk about being depressed, and never accepting help and then breaking up and still hearing it through text and STILL trying to get him to see a professional and get help I am honestly burned out and mentally drained.

What kind of fucking person just watches someone struggle??? Apparently I do... I just like, froze I guess, I couldn't move my body, it was like I was paralyzed and I had a pit in my stomach and I felt just really anxious if that's how youd describe it. \nI hate who I've become, I just want to go back to being the kind guy who always helps others instead of watching them struggle like a jackass. \n\nI dont know how to fix who I have become and I'm afraid it's going to affect me when I try and get a job this summer and when I go to college, I'm afraid I'm going to be this shell of who i used to be, someone who just watches things happen instead of giving a helping hand. I feel like agoddamn failure, mainly because I am. \n\nI guess this story type thing doesnt really have any point, just me talking to myself reflecting on how much of an asshole I am. If someone actually reads this, well, then I'd love any suggestions on how i can get rid of this damn shell. \n\nI left alot of details out, but it's 1am and I have school in the morning so maybe I'll come back sometime on my computer and fill in a bit more. \nThanks for reading this if you did, I sincerely hope you dont have to go through what I've gone through.", "Why can't I be happy for friends who are doing well for themselves Whenever I run into a friend I always try and be supportive and happy for them if they are doing well.

I crave some discipline; the dental work came as a result of time running out as it were, reactive not proactive. I want to be strong enough to work thru this shit at a healthy pace, not leave things go awry for months on end, until a consequence happens. But I suppose in order to get there I have to first admit that I AM weak and I DO need help. I can\u2019t do it all on my own like I tell myself I must. \n\nI\u2019d really like to get an exercise bike. I can see all the positives: cardio health/body positivity/motivation to hike more/overall getting in shape. For someone healthy, buying a bike (putting in the research, going to stores, asking people for advice) would be doable. Simple tasks like that are fucking hard for me because I\u2019m not healthy.\n\nSo how do I get there? Ask my sister to take me shopping one day? This post is a good start: question why I\u2019ve failed in the past and talk through the doable steps, remind myself of the positive outcomes in working thru it.

You realize that you\u2019re in denial all this time. That something you never thought you would want becomes something you realized you pushed away into the ignorant side of your mind so you wouldn\u2019t think about it. So yes, a part of my soul is gone. And I\u2019ve been trying to numb that pain that is beyond any kind of description. I feel like I had something precious that was ripped out of my hands and lit on fire to burn. Something that was alive and part of me burned and I could feel that slow, painful burn. Like watching someone you love get tortured by some unknown entity. This results in the stages of grief.... there\u2019s denial. Which I already had since I was a child. I grew up in ignorant bliss. Not wanting to acknowledge what I knew was true. \nThe there was anger. This nasty creature that you create to get back at whatever hurt you. And it will literally drive you mad. Crazy, trying to show others how much someone hurt you. Trying to find something called \u201cclosure\u201d ( which by the way is the only fairytale or myth that you will ever hear. Closure is the only thing in the world that is impossible). Now you\u2019re stuck in this miserable monster. You wonder how you\u2019ll escape alive and some never do. I\u2019m sorry for the ones who were the center of my anger and unclearity. You did not deserve what I gave you from my period of grief.\nThen you bargain. For the sake of whatever sanity you may have left. You bargain for hope, freedom, and whatever else that you have. It\u2019s not a lot. But regardless you bargain just the same. You try to find people who will help and love you unconditionally. Then you realize that they can\u2019t enable the grief anymore than you can. You\u2019re left alone again. Wondering who the hell you have become because it just isn\u2019t you anymore. You\u2019ve become this sad and hopeless mess of a person. The people you love love you so much they can\u2019t take your struggling any more that you can. That\u2019s when your soul dies a little more.\nThen there is depression. That\u2019s there through y\u2019all of the stages. That feeling of NO motivation. No life. It\u2019s an empty void but filled with all the feeling mentioned prior. Depression makes you remember your not the only one. You are made of many sad and hurting people who just want some sort of clarity. They just question every day \u201c why? What can I do? Why am I feeling these things.\u201d This makes you wonder if your feelings are even ok to feel. \nSupposedly, there is acceptance.... I have not gotten there yet. Most with depression haven\u2019t. Good luck to all of us. This is that bridge that we have not crossed and some (myself) are very afraid to cross it. It means that we will be ok. And sometimes that\u2019s really scary because we don\u2019t always know how to feel ok anymore. We have the beautiful loved ones that have been there no matter what. They want our success and happiness. A deep part of our soul wants that too.... the part that is still alive. We forget that part don\u2019t we? My beautiful friends. There is a soul in our bodies. One that has not been ripped away. One that cannot be taken from an ugly thing such as grief. Every day that we are here. Together. Let\u2019s reach out to the part of our soul that has survived.

It was set up through my work's EAP service, which I've used before with limited success. \n\nAnyway, I had my first session this week and it was weird. First of all, it was in a very unconventional location. It was in an office (I mean literally a room with a desk and some office chairs), inside an organization not typically known for mental health services. So that was weird and it took me a while to get comfortable enough to start talking. \n\nSince this was the first session, most of it was just me explaining what was going on in my life and why I'm there. Anyway, near the end she remarked that I was a fascinating person and she really wants to talk to me more. That's my first time hearing that, especially from a professional.

I managed to escape and go to school away from my parents in college, but if anything, I have become even worse. I am so desperately afraid of losing the friends that I have made, in particular, someone who is the FIRST person in my life to have feelings for me. He knows me like the back of my hand, but now that we are doing long distance, it's naturally just harder and sometimes I come off as insecure when I ask him things. Most of the time, he is the only one I talk to about many things such as my parents which many don't understand. I just really don't want to lose him and he has said that he is tired of me being insecure, but I am naturally just not that special or pretty or smart and I can't help it.

This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  \n\nWe've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an \"innocent\" message like \"if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace\" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). \n\nWe deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  \n\nPlease report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the \"report\" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. \n\nThanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.  \n    \n    \n\n******\n***[/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement)***  \n*******\n\n###Summary###\n\n**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** \n\n###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###\n\nWe're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  \n\nBut there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. \n\nAnything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. \n\nDo not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  \n\nIn [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. \n\n**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something \"innocent\" like \"I hope you find peace\", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  \n\n###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###\n\nKeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  \n\n* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular \"good\" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that \"it's not so bad\", and this is usually experienced as \"I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try\".  People who've had \"help\" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   \n\n*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. \n\n* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the \"it gets better\" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. \n\n* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.\n\nTo avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.\n\n###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###\n\nOften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  \n\nThey will typically try to scratch their psychological \"itch\" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:\n\n* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than \"brutally forcing someone to stay alive\" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.\n\n* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of \"solidarity\" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  \n\nMany suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: \n\n* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (\"Don't do it!\"), cheerleading (\"You've got this!\") or meaningless false promises (\"Trust me, it gets better!\"), or invalidation (\"Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!\").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)\n\n* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  \n\nPlease [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.", "Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here. Any day.

I put everything I had into salvaging the relationship, but in the end even offering to uproot my whole life for her, it wasn't enough. I sunk really low, but I had a friend who helped me through it and did everything in his power to help me out. I went to theropy for a bit but found it far more stressful than useful, so I turned to self help books. I started to think more positively, have a bit, more confidence in my self, and felt like I genuinely self improved. That countied until a few days ago. I got rejected by someone I really cared about, and it didn't go well.\n\nAfter farther reflection, I haven't made progress on any of the goals I set to fix myself, even though I put in all my effort. My little confidence I gained is shattered. For the last few days, I have though about sueicde a lot, to the point where I don't go into work anymore because there is no point. That friend I had has moved up in life, to the point where I feel if I reach out to him I will just be a burden anyways. I am not close to my family at all, and if they knew I was depressed they would tell me to suck it up.

Recently, I've realized just how important variety and freshness is in everyday life. I know that many of the tips I will list below are not possible when you are in a particularly dark place, but I thought I'd mention them anyway \u2014 perhaps something will be of help to you. Here are a few things that help me keep overwhelming bouts of anxiety and ideation at bay: \n\n* Push yourself to wake up a little earlier. Stretch slowly with deep breaths and take a walk around your neighborhood as the sky turns rosy-yellow. Try to appreciate the new day; think of something, anything, to look forward to. Return home for a  warm shower and freshly-laundered clothes.\n* Sleep a little bit earlier. Wash your sheets and buy a few soft blankets to make your bed into a cozy sanctuary. Allot time for reading or journalling to clear your mind.\n* Allot time to cook simple, lovely meals. Steam fresh vegetables, cook some rice, or cut up a fruit salad of apples, bananas, and citrus. Eat mindfully and drink plenty of water. \n* Buy a well-bound journal and a good quality pen. Write down achievable to-do lists, make calendars, note groceries, thoughts, haikus \u2014  anything. Put your thoughts in ink; appreciate daily observations. \n* Reorganize your space, or at least a little section of it. Listen to a nice podcast as you do so. Put your sheets and pillowcase into the laundry. Clear out your shelves and drawers, sort through everything, and replace it all neatly. Light a lovely candle and add some fresh flowers. Open a window or two.\n* Buy or borrow a book on any topic which sparks even the slightest interest. Crocheting? Botany? Medieval history? Delving into a new topic just for the sake of it is worthwhile.\n* Embrace non-competitive hobbies. This is incredibly important in a product(ivity)-obsessed society which devalues craftsmanship and pure interests. Activities like the following enrich your daily life and force you to set aside some time away from mandatory tasks: needle-felting, gardening, writing (poems, books, articles, blogs), painting, photography, wood-whittling, typography, graphic design, etc. Ensure that whatever you choose, the hobby involves holding the  fruits of your labor in your hands. You do not have to be \"good\" at it \u2013  this is not a career choice. Watching yourself grow and have fun with  it is success in and of itself.\n\nI hope you are doing well \u2014 I'm glad you are here, reading this. Wishing you warmth and support.", "I\u2018m too scared to kill myself and it fucks me up big time My life is not worth living. \nI am the most destructive person to myself and the ones I love. Everyday looks the same, I go to school, I work, I procrastinate, I stress, I cry, I sleep, I repeat. Every. Day. Is. The. Same and it gets unbearable. I haven\u2019t talked to my therapist for 4 month because it doesn\u2019t help, going inpatient for the 5th time doesn\u2019t help. Nothing helps. And school makes it IMPOSSIBLE for me to enjoy literally fucking ANYTHING. I NEVER in my whole life felt this depressed, even though I survived an suicide attempt a few years ago, that doesn\u2019t compare to the depression I am feeling right now and it\u2019s scary. After all these years of therapy I am doing even worse. I just want to lie in my bed and fall asleep and never wake up again. But I am also to scared that people think I don\u2019t try enough or that I am lazy so I put on a mask and pretend, smile, make people laugh, pretend, till I come home and completely destroy my mother with my thoughts and depression. It\u2019s so fucking exhausting. I had such high expectations for my life, I had dreams and hope.

I just feel like it\u2019s always something with me. I\u2019m not doing anything big or exciting or impactful. I\u2019m turning 25 in a few days, I\u2019m married to a good man who loves me but we\u2019ve struggled with communication and compatibility so we\u2019ve been in therapy working on it. It\u2019s hard work. He\u2019s worth it, I love him, I\u2019m in love with him, he\u2019s my best friend and partner, but I didn\u2019t think it would be this hard. Nobody talks about how hard being a couple is, it\u2019s all \u201cit shouldn\u2019t be hard with the right person\u201d and that makes me feel like a failure. I feel like a failure in everything in my life. I can\u2019t keep a job, I\u2019m currently unemployed and have no skills or qualifications in anything that is even remotely interesting to me. I hate not contributing financially and we\u2019re struggling. We can barely eat right now, it\u2019s humiliating. And it\u2019s my fault. I struggle with infertility, all we want is to start our family. I can\u2019t even do that. I never finished college and I have the debt to remind me every day. It\u2019s not going to get easier. I\u2019m an adult. Nothing significant is going to change and make things easier. I\u2019ll never have the life I dream of, so what\u2019s the point?\n\nI\u2019ve overcome so much with anxiety and OCD. But it\u2019s still here and it really burns me out sometimes. I keep thinking about my future and how scary it is to age. I\u2019m not afraid of dying, but I\u2019m afraid of ceasing to exist if that makes sense. Who will be there at the end? Will I get sick? Will my husband? We could be in accidents, I could lose him to something traumatic, anything could happen. How do people live their whole lives? Becoming 40 feels so unrealistic. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why I should keep doing this. I always have some kind of problem that\u2019s insignificant compared to the suffering of others.

Though you wouldn\u2019t think that if you met me. Every day I slap on a smile and ask myself, \u201cwhat kind of beauty am I going to see today?\u201d and I allow life to flow. People say I\u2019m so nice and so happy, so fun and charming. I had gotten so good at it I had even convinced myself for the passed 10yrs that I\u2019ve been happy. Truth is though I don\u2019t think I\u2019d know happiness if it hit me in the face. \nI think I\u2019ve been depressed since young childhood, coming from a wildly dysfunctional military home, being constantly bullied, I turned to sex drugs and alcohol at a very young age in order to cope. Now I\u2019m 25, in a big city, feeling more isolated than ever. I work two jobs, I was going to university but decided to drop out to do a trade. I decided to be poly because I felt so lonely in monogamous relationships but poly has been nothing but heartache. I live with a close friend who doesn\u2019t clean at all and constantly has his girl friend over even tho he works nights and she has her own apartment. I don\u2019t know how to set boundaries because no one has ever respected them. I\u2019ve been in and out of therapy (currently out but I guess almost back in). I\u2019ve been assaulted and abused. My cat has never cuddled me. I don\u2019t know how to make deep connections with people or how to keep friendships. Then I think about the state of the world and feel so helpless and hopeless. There is no point. I fantasize about dying every single day, I think about ending my life every single day. I am so incredibly miserable, I\u2019m so incredibly tired.

I just spend all day sleeping, eating and watching TV which is getting boring after doing it for several years. It wouldnt be so bad if I could enjoy some of my solitary hobbies that I used to enjoy but now I just pick something up and then lose interest within a few minutes. It just feels like I'm delaying the inevitable at this point as I dont know how many more years I can put up with doing the same old crap until something other than myself kills me.\n\nI feel guilty for thinking it but I just wish that my 2 family members that I'm close to would die just so that I can't feel guilty in my last moments about leaving them with grief. Then again, I know it'd be a relief for them in a way knowing that I wont be hopelessly trying to survive without them in this life. It's becoming easier to see the potential positives to me killing myself compared to the negatives. \n\nWhat's worse is that I'm transgender and have completed my transition (F&gt;M) but rather than it being a lease of life, its become more like a 'phew, at least now I can die in peace' type of situation.

Ive seen numerous Gi specialists who have all told me that im in perfect health, despite their best efforts nothing they have tried has ever worked. The last specialist i saw basically told me that everything had been tried and there was nothing left for him to do, he gave me a few meds to try but they didnt help at all. Ive been seeking help with my mental health for over 5 years but in the end everyone ive seen has either dismissed me immediately or kicked me out after a year of not helping. The last time i tried to get help i ended up getting seen for maybe 5 minutes then told i had mild depression and given a recommendation to take back to my GP. The final nail in the coffin was yesterday when i went to see an ENT after over a year of waiting, ive had what i thought was sinusitis but just like every other doctor he told me i was perfectly healthy and that he couldnt help me. Honestly the \"sinus infection\" was the one thing i thought i actually understood but now that even that isnt real my mind just feels shattered. I thought i could atleast make it through the year, hopefully see another specialist and try even more tests but now i just cant see the point. All its going to bring is more frustration and depression, i feel like i should just do everyone a favor and kill myself.

It\u2019s been like this for months now (it somehow only grew worse), and I really thought antidepressants would magically cure me, but I haven\u2019t been feeling much of a difference.\n\nI can\u2019t kill myself because of the emotional toll it would have on my family, so if I can\u2019t do that, what can I do?\n\nI think the next best thing is to commit \u201cemotional suicide\u201d.

Hey, this is really weird for me and I wouldn\u2019t normally do something like this but I don\u2019t really know what else to do. Ever since I was a little kid I have thought life was pretty pointless and I kinda just wanted to die. As I grew up it gradually got worse and at this point I seriously just want to kill myself. I don\u2019t have a bad life or anything I have just been searching for so long and I\u2019ve never found a reason to want to be here. I have always had a problem making friends, I am always there for people and I love being able to help people, people just don\u2019t like me. It could be a perception thing tho. In any case, I just spent two years with someone who I believe to be one of the most amazing people in the world, I loved him so much and genuinely thought I would spend the rest of my life with him but he broke up with me. He told me he was never happy with me and it broke me. I have met millions of people and I don\u2019t believe I will ever be happy with someone like I was with him. I can\u2019t be happy without him and he can\u2019t be happy with me but to be his friend and see him happy with someone else would tear me to pieces. Everyone says I\u2019ll move on and be happy again but it\u2019s been months and it still feels fresh as the day it happened. The only reason I am still here is because of my mom. She guilt trips me into not committing suicide even though she has also always been suicidal. She also doesn\u2019t believe in therapy and thinks making your bed will make the depression go away. The idea of killing my self isn\u2019t scary to me and I know the people in my life will be sad but I am not enough of anything to anyone for it to be a big deal.

I knew roughly why he would be there but it was still such a shock to me. It wasnt until a few days later that he opened up to me and said that he had made a plan and chose out the weapon but decided after his therapy session that he didnt want to do it anymore. So it's a weird in between spot. While he didnt necessarily attempt suicide he was damn close.

There hasn't been a day in at least 5-6 years that suicide hasn't crossed my mind. I've managed to stay pretty functional. Less so now. I can't do anything. I'm used to having bad days. I'm used to that. But for the longest time my bad days were maximum 17 hours in bed then I get up to piss or something. It's different now. My bad days are 31 hours in bed no food or water.

I'm off my shit. I break down again and resort to meds. I've always been against meds for myself so idk maybe that adds some perspective. I felt like meds were the equivalent of me giving up my personality, becoming the masses. Pretentious I know but whatever. Meds don't do shit. I've had so many appointments with my psychiatrist to change my meds or the dosage but nothing has worked and it's been too long. \n\nI decided to go into an outpatient program in February. Things were really bad. I started disassociating very intensely. I can't feel my body move, I can't control my motions. It's one of the most terrifying things I've ever experienced.

It's so fucking humiliating to not be able to take care of yourself because you can't afford it. When I grew up everyone thought I was gonna be the kid to escape this shit.

I really thought I had a chance. But I don't.\n\nThere's no escaping the cycle of poverty. It comes back to bite no matter what you do.

My mom won't buy me food, my dad is trying to not lose his other kid, and my grandma (who raised me) is forced to live with my dad and pay off the house because he can't afford it and knew he could leech off of her. I can't work because I'm already failing all my classes and I'm supposed to fix that.\n\nThe worst part is being aware of my situation. I can't afford to be healthy. I can't afford to be educated.

University student. Stressed to the max with zero support system whatsoever. I was homeless before college (and in college) and moved across the country right after high school, cutting off contact with my abusive family. Been suicidal most of the time since being in college and in high school but still here. Came out and got a girlfriend, still nothing got better. We were homeless together for a while and experienced a lot together, been with each other for over two years. She\u2019s an alcoholic though and because it\u2019s a progressive disease things got worse over time and began to hit a low October/November 2019. Anyone who\u2019s got experience with an alcoholic loved one knows how awful it gets. I never thought things could get so much worse, but then I never thought I\u2019d be a suicidally depressed 21 year old and I also never thought I\u2019d date an alcoholic. It has a way of destroying your soul unlike anything else you\u2019ll ever experience, and I\u2019ve been abused since I was an infant. I put aside my own sense of self, my own needs and well being to focus on hers while my heart got ripped out, stomped on, and spat on repeatedly.

I know things take time but I\u2019m tired of waiting for when life gets \u201cgood\u201d. I used to think happiness was a personal choice and I still believe that a little bit, but with all the garbage I\u2019ve experienced in my 21 years I\u2019m mostly just of the opinion that some of us are dealt horrible hands in life and doomed from the start. While I \u201chave\u201d people in my life who care about me I will never have the kind of person who cares about and supports others to the extent that I do. And maybe that\u2019s a good thing, because doing so has made me lose everything about myself. But now my glass is empty and there\u2019s nothing to pour into it.

I'm 24  and still have terrible acne. I used to not hate the way i looked up until high school, but then I got hit with the acne. Huge cystic acne that left scars all over my face and is super painful. I used to look at myself in high school the mirror and say \" I hate myself and want to die\" as a mantra. I was holding onto the hope that it was just a teenage phase, and that I would get on with my life after. Now its been years and years and I still get new zits and cysts every day. It's painful, and they pop and bleed everywhere. I've tried all of the acne treatments except accutaine which my doctor recommended against for reasons in my medical history. To offset the acne I grew my hair long and made it my main feature to distract from the disgusting acne. It became such a large part of my personality that all my friends at the time called me goldilocks. \n\nThen recently ago I started balding really quickly. My hairline is going way back, and I'm starting to lose hair on my crown. Looking at old pictures of my dad it's all gonna be gone in a few years. I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. My face is red and pocked and covered in acne and the one and only thing that I liked about my appearance is slowly falling away. I'm some sort of freakish middle age man/ greasy teen hybrid. I used to have moderate luck is the relationship department back when I had my hair, but noone will even look at me now. My hair was the only thing I was ever complimented on. Now I'm treated like some monster that noone wants in their pictures or their life. \n\nI've been trying to not off myself for a while now. My family would be devastated and that's the only thing that is keeping me from doing it.

That day, my entire life had changed and since then I haven\u2019t been able to recover. While yes I was depressed much before this and had been struggling with suicidal thoughts and tendencies since I was 8, my father death had made it all so much worse. I had started to get on anti-depressants, get counseling, and come out to my mother as trans not long after this because she had discovered I was trans. None of these treatments helped much until late November after I had attempted suicide and realized how cared for I was by family that had visited me in the hospital, then I really started to work hard for them to get better and to make sure I could get to the day when I could start hormone replacement therapy in about a year. Not long after that incident I traveled to New Mexico to visit family and my mom fell in love with a hole here and felt the need to reconnect with the family that lived there so she had decided to buy a home here and make my family move, which I can\u2019t fully blame her for wanting to get out of the state we lived in (ny), it reminded her too much of my dad. When I first heard this news I was depressed about it but slowly become more accepting as I got much happier and healthier. I got to a point where I no longer felt the need for medication and cut back on therapy before moving to New Mexico, but those months of hard work all crashed when I got here. When I moved I had honestly lost everything I had known and have been stuck with a family of alcoholics who always start stupid drama over small things. I feel as if I can\u2019t even do anything without someone starting shit about something I\u2019ve done when I\u2019m around them. But anyways soon enough I start school, I\u2019m fairly excited about it but quickly that excitement dies out and is replaced with absolute misery. The school I currently go to refuses to let me use the mens bathroom and makes me use the women\u2019s one because of my biological sex, keeps all of my accounts and name on the attendance as my birth name despite the fact I don\u2019t identify with it, and dress coded me for piercings and dyed hair which they had never mentioned would be a problem when I went to register for the school not even a week before the school year started. So on my first day I get dress coded for things I was never warned about and told I had signed a paper that states I fully read through the dress code and agreed to comply with it (which I had actually gotten two weeks later during school hours). Bullshit, right? Well it gets worse. The only kid willing to talk to me was a drug addict who had done cocaine in front of me and offered me some, while high he almost choked himself to death and chucked a desk at the girls in front of us which was quite fucking terrifying. Almost a month after this event the same kid breaks my pencil sharpener and takes the blade part out of it, leaving the class shortly after to go to the bathroom. Of course I tell the teacher and she gets the counselor to get him, and he gets sent to a mental hospital for a week or so and transfers schools. So while yes, he may have been an absolute crackhead he was still the only friend I had so I was very bummed out and felt alone. Months pass and I feel more and more depressed as days go by, I start contemplating suicide once again and try to get my mom to get me a therapist (which she still hasn\u2019t done). And of course on top of all of this kids at school find out I\u2019m transgender and I\u2019ve been getting dead named, picked on, and asked extremely personal questions  since then. Because of this discovery made by my classmates I\u2019ve started to also gotten rape threats and death threats in which I feel there\u2019s no point in reporting since the school cannot even comply by the laws and let me use the bathroom I feel comfortable in. Well I have started to make friends I still feel all alone and hopeless for things to get any better for my life, I\u2019ve been trying so hard to get my life back into shape and actually gave loving here my best shot but I\u2019ve failed myself and been failed by so many others, I see no point in continuing on since things keep getting worse and I\u2019m not sure if I can hold on that much longer. The only reason I\u2019m still here is because I know there\u2019s people that care and I don\u2019t want to put them through the same pain I went through when I lost my dad.", "Where do I go?

See you next time around!", "[TW] I am 16 and have attempted suicide 4 times; bullying about my appearance is making me consider it again I generally steer clear of making posts of this nature since I don't like discussing my personal life on social media. That said, this is something that I feel I must be open about in order to come to terms with it. To contextualise, I'm a 16 year old girl and I'm originally from Eastern Europe, but I now live in the UK. This may be a very long read and I'll be sure to TL;DR.\n\nI was diagnosed with autism at the age of 4. I'm not 'low functioning' (for lack of a better term; feel free to suggest one) per se, but to other people, it's pretty obvious that I am developmentally disabled. I have poor fine motor skills, struggle to articulate my thoughts and am extremely susceptible to meltdowns when not on birth control (I'll explain this later).\n\nFor most of my early childhood this was largely not a huge issue in my life. I received good support and people were usually empathetic towards my struggles. However, things started to go slowly and then eventually very dramatically downhill once I got my period age 10.\n\nMy parents noticed that I had menstrual cycles that were on average around 21 days in length. Initially, they weren't too worried and assumed they would eventually become more regular as time went on. They didn't. They became shorter, and when I last calculated them, my cycles lasted 18 days on average. This messed up my hormones and I became extremely depressed. This depression peaked around my period. I don't mean that I got typical premenstrual symptoms; in the days leading up to my period, I would self harm, have suicidal thoughts, experience very violent and dramatic mood swings, become extremely sensitive to sound and texture and lose interest in my hobbies and friends. I suggested possibly having PMDD but this idea was dismissed by my parents and doctors.\n\nI first attempted suicide when I was either 13 or 14 (but definitely no older). I didn't inform my parents of this, but only because I didn't want to upset them or make them feel like they had failed me as parents, because they definitely didn't. I then attempted once more aged 15.\n\nDuring this time period I was prescribed the combined oral contraceptive pill. Theoretically, I am supposed to 'tricycle' them, or in other words, take three months' worth of packs and then take a break. I did this until the second most recent attempt in October of last year. This was the first one that I told anybody about and you may not be shocked to hear that it happened whilst I was on a 'period break'. I went to A&amp;E the next day, where I waited for seven hours before being seen by a therapist for twenty minutes who told me that I seemed to have things 'under control' and took no action except refer me to another therapist, who I had one appointment with where I heard the same thing. It was my mother's birthday that day and I have not forgiven myself for making her spend it in A&amp;E. She stayed mostly collected throughout it all but I could tell she felt very upset and shaken. Since this, I have stopped taking breaks and now do not have periods at all. This is massively helpful but my situation is still not great.\n\nIt's partly for that reason that I didn't inform her of my most recent attempt in December. It was also because I was due to fly to Canada the day after the attempt and couldn't bring myself to jeopardise the trip. I considered calling a suicide hotline once I was in Montreal but ended up not doing it, mainly because when I looked up numbers to call, I couldn't find one in Quebec that offered English counselling, but also because my mother discouraged it because of what we would be charged (please remember, she didn't know that I had attempted suicide).\n\nI'm in Year 11, which in the UK is the final year of high school. I'm currently caught up in revising for my GCSEs, which I'm doing OK with from an academic perspective, but struggling to cope with mentally. I'm also being bullied; less than in previous years but still in a way that fucks me up even though I pretend it doesn't. I used to be targeted for my personality and mannerisms, which I've given up being upset about since I've accepted that I don't carry myself typically. Recently, though, they've shifted to targeting my appearance.\n\nThis may make me sound shallow, but as a 16 year old girl, having my appearance mocked and scorned is completely crushing. A few months ago it was never something I gave much thought and I never felt insecure about my appearance outside of typical concerns teenage girls have. People call me 'ugly' and laugh at me to my face. I've never been in a relationship of any kind and, at the risk of sounding like an incel, this does not give me hope for the future and makes me question if I am physically attractive to anybody. It makes me feel arrogant for having ever thought that there was nothing wrong with the way I look. And I'm starting to spiral emotionally because of it. 15 year old me would have laughed at the idea of me being so insecure about my physical appearance, but for me, it was one of the few things I had genuine confidence and pride in and now it is being taken from me.\n\nI feel very shallow and fragile for feeling this way. I'm 16 and have four attempts to my name and it's embarrassing. I hate that I'll never really be able to disassociate myself from that because this isn't what I want to look back on in 10 or 20 years time.\n\nTL;DR I'm a 16 year old autistic girl who has attempted suicide 4 times and is now reconsidering due to bullying concerning my physical appearance.", "The only reason that I'm alive is because I cant handle pain well To make a long story short I'm too much of a pussy bitch to be able to handle pain well enough to try anything, best I can do is punch myself in the face when I feel really bad which does nothing but make me feel worse.", "Someone please please please help me I\u2019m currently balling my eyes out while typing this I\u2019m On the edge of suicide I can\u2019t deal with the pain anymore no one fucking likes me and I\u2019m always nice to them Everythint feels so dry I\u2019m fucking crying \n\nI\u2019m sorry", "How easy is it to die by drugs?

I've got no one to talk to and honestly I've just had enough. I got into a bit of a car accident today and burst my tyre and I just don't have the energy to sort it.

She had strange rituals where she would obsess over locking the doors (pointing to the OCD she has today) and was the unspoken black sheep of the family. My older sister and I already were aware of her depression, and took her to a counselor (who didn't do much for her). We saw her cutting herself, but were too afraid to approach my parents as they are African. It wasn't until last year, my little sister of eight years old walked into the bedroom and saw my sister h\\*nging herself on the back of the door. Luckily we got her in time, and she was admitted in the hospital. After a week or so, she came back beaming and happy. She has a therapist who she \"adores\", and is on medication. Everything was going smooth until she relapsed into her ways, and I caught her in another attempt. She's attempted. around 20 times now. My mom has had to quit her job to watch her. My sister claims she is doing fine, but just the other day I checked her phone and she was searching suicide methods. I have many after-school activities and no one can watch her around the clock. Someone please help me, I'm beyond the point of stressed and I have no determination. My grades have decreased this year because I spend so much time looking after her, yet, she ignores me and complains how people bother her. I'm scared to go to sleep, because sometimes she roams around looking for ways to hurt herself again. How am I supposed to help a teen who doesn't want to help themselves?!

I'm tired and still suffer from depression. I don't drink or do drugs. I work out almost every day, have had therapy and cannot shake what goes on in my head.

I try to look after myself, but it gets fucking hard getting out of bed and actually looking after myself when I wish that all of this would go away. \n\nThey say I look like my Dad, as if it were a positive aspect, even though he left me when I was a baby. So what? I'm supposed to be grateful for looking like someone who not only was a deadbeat, but also that I should be grateful that I have to look bad for something I couldn't control. I just want to get plastic surgery ASAP. The only reason why I'm working so hard (or at least trying) is to get enough money to fix this shit. I feel so anxious that I feel like when people talk to me, it's out of pity. Why would you talk to someone who looks ugly? My personality doesn't match my body; I can be aspirational, confident at times (shocking right?) , and empathetic. But then I'm a 6'2, slightly chubby piece of shit and whilst that could potentially be fixed, why the fuck is it so hard for me. I swim about 1.5 - 2 miles a week and I eat okay and I can't lose weight. And if I were to get plastic surgery etc., I know that my family would disapprove it, despite that my siblings look so much better than me, seriously. It's not even my family, but my mum, how would she look at me.\n\nBut on the other hand this can't happen any longer. It's like my reputation is based on looks when I'm so much more. I want to cry but no one would care because *where's the reward when it isn't a cute \"depressed\" girl to help?* I get judged for being nice, as if I were trying to get some. Could any of you give me your thoughts on plastic surgery. It pisses me off how I would get criticised, like I'm forced to stay this way but others who are naturally fit get to have a good life. I just can't keep going on.\n\nI remember one time I was talking to someone and felt like I wanted to cry because I was thinking \"no one would ever see me like the way they see other people \" (i.e. romantically). I wanted to die, like I always have. But I cannot for certain personal reasons. Hence I am trying to choose the other method: work really hard and if things don't change I **will kill myself regardless of my morals &amp; the consequences etc.** But please, don't comment the bullshit of \"you'll find someone who loves you for your personality\". That is pity and that fucking beats me to the ground. I had a mini panic attack but I tried to contain it to write this. Opinions would be appreciated.

I\u2019m not feeling too well right now. I\u2019m getting these thoughts and suicidal feeling again. They come back occasionally. Right now, I\u2019m eating with my beautiful mother, laughing with my dad as he says my mother is a wonderful cook. I broke down last night when I finished reviewing and studying from my classes. I studied hard for a test I had today, and I felt good about it! Right now, I\u2019m eating as I type this. This day? I thought it would be bad, but it was okay, turning to bad. I\u2019m In a relationship. I love this boy so much. I\u2019ve been happiest with him since years ago. Im a sophomore in high school by the way. I\u2019ve trusted my boyfriend so much and he\u2019s always been there for me. Today however, I felt something was wrong. He didn\u2019t really speak with me. But it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m probably just overthinking it, I want nothing but pure happiness for him. Whether he finds it with someone else or me. I\u2019ve always helped others, always had a smile on my face and I\u2019ve always wanted nothing but happiness for everyone. I\u2019ve only want happiness for everyone else. I want them to feel good and appreciated by atleast someone when they do something. I\u2019ve always supported through anything and I\u2019ve never judged. I\u2019ve been kind to everyone. I appreciate everything that\u2019s given to me, but it\u2019s been a few months I\u2019ve been feeling these usual suicide thoughts. They come often. It\u2019s been a year since I\u2019ve been like this, trying to hang on and move on from it. Whether I see happy moments, times where I love this view. Or others where I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m feeling.\n\nI felt pressured by my mother. Verbally. I hate trying so hard at school, and failing. What\u2019s the point? I\u2019m going to fail anyways. I\u2019ve always done my best in everything and I\u2019ve always tried to stay happy and look the positive way. But I can\u2019t anymore. I\u2019ve always thought, what if I can just end it? Would anyone really miss me? I think about it, imagining my parents. But, would I really make a difference? Will I go to hell? Religiously talking, I love god. But I\u2019m sorry, I feel like I\u2019ve lost faith in myself. I don\u2019t see it anymore. And every night, I pray, to have a good day, to see my parents, my friends. To stay safe. I want to die, but I don\u2019t. But I want to attempt, but I\u2019m afraid. What if I fail? Would my family be ashamed? \n\nI think about it daily, and I feel like the only reason I\u2019m\nhere is for my love. To be there for him when he needs company, to be there for him when he can\u2019t find the light, to be with him when he can\u2019t be happy. To support him through the good and bad. No matter what, no matter the past. For my dad, who\u2019s worked really hard every single night for me and my family. For my friend, who needs support from his friends and family. For my dog, who always listened to me when I felt alone, knowing he wouldn\u2019t understand, but knows I\u2019m upset and let\u2019s me cry on him when I don\u2019t have anyone else.  \n\nI don\u2019t know, I feel like tonight could be it.

I never loved someone like this. But I lied and told him I was completely over my ex. I wasn\u2019t. He said he would leave me if I did. So I lied. And later he found texts. I broke up with my ex for him. But he found us talking about our relationship. I still love you, I told her. He was heartbroken. You cheated on me, he said. I insisted no, it was breaking trust, but you can\u2019t say cheating. I apologized so much. I changed so many behaviors. I couldn\u2019t make it up to him. He finally came to me, didn\u2019t talk to me two months, and said, you cheated on me, you manipulated me. I\u2019m done. He did many things that hurt me during the whole time we knew each other. He left me and came back so many times. It got worse and worse. But it\u2019s not an exchange. No matter his actions, I should have done better. I lost him. He was right. It took me so many months to understand what he really meant. I thought of this every day. Now I get it. I destroyed him. I loved him so much. But this was so disrespectful. I\u2019ll never see him again. I\u2019ll never get to love him again. I did such a bad thing. He\u2019ll never care for me. I need to die. I know everyone will convince me no. But I do.

I\u2019m as bad as he said. I\u2019m everything he said I was. I\u2019m an abuser. I never understood it before. I abused him! How could I have done that? How could I not have seen it? How could I not have begged for forgiveness? I hurt him so bad. He wanted to kill himself, it hurt him so bad. I deserve it! To feel like this! I can\u2019t forgive myself. I can\u2019t solve this. I can\u2019t get what I want out of this. He\u2019s so far moved on. It\u2019s over, it\u2019s done, I can\u2019t get over it. I want him back so badly. I miss him so much.

I was almost self harm free for a month, but of course I fucked that up and cut again. I hate myself so fucking much, and I hate myself more for even trying to get help and support from anyone. People have told me to my face to kill myself, yet I don't blame them at all. I'm just a fucking selfish asshole even though I don't even think of myself as human. Every single minor inconvenience makes me want to slit my wrists, which of course, only makes me feel absolutely fucking terrible because there are so many people that have it worse off than me. My dad threatened to beat the shit out of me again, though he didn't do it, and I think that's what's really pushing me over the edge. He's a tall, very muscular guy at 6'4, so it isn't like I could defend myself anyways. I want to kill myself so bad, just to end the world's suffering. I'm such a fucking burden, and it's like everything that comes out of my mouth is just more reason to rid them of my existence. My mom is insanely over protective, always insisting on \"tucking me in\" and kissing me and laying with me. And while that is a lot nicer than being literally beat by your mother, she FORCES me to kiss her. Once, I refused, and she pinned me by my wrists to my bed. I put on such a thick facade that sometimes I don't even know who I am. Nothing I do is actually myself, I'm just pretending for everyone else's sake. People are actually stupid enough to care about me to an extent. Sometimes, I wish it weren't like that, and that they wouldn't be affected by my death. The person that they think they know and love doesn't exist, and nobody knew me before I was how I am. It's not like that matters now; I was just a kid. I'm such a fucking idiot. I hate myself.

For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on.

She wants nothing to do with me, nor does 2 of her half-sisters, who aren't even nearby (I called DFCS after we split because there were (literally hundreds) of roaches in the apartment in which we lived and she would so nothing about, among other things (like the time her autistic son found her loaded, insecure handgun), but those details are just stuff since I'm now a pariah. 100% would call again. So anyway, no contact with the youngest 3.\n\nBut what I'm really struggling with is, \"Why not?\"\n\nI know all of the typical reasons involving everyone else, that they'll be hurt, it will affect them horribly, etc. But what about me? Why not? My girlfriend really doesn't like me tbh. (she said I'm the rudest person she's ever met and I believe she means it, even though I've never been told that I was a rude person in 50 years.\n\nBut for me, aside from how it affects others, why the hell not? I have no religious faith, because I just don't. If you take away how it affects others, I just don't see a reason to keep living anymore. My job sucks, my girlfriend doesn't even really like me apparently, and I see my parents once a year for 2 days or so and my only brother I haven't seen in 7 tmyears even though we get along.\n\nMy hearing sucks, I'm constantly having to ask people to repeat themselves and that frustrates all involved. And even when I don't, I have really loud tinnitus. Neuropathy, ADHD, constant joint pain (not debilitating but always there), frequent memory loss (my gf had to show me pictures of our 3rd date at a steak place because I didn't remember it all and that's not uncommon).\n\nSo, why? My current relationship is probably ending soon anyway. For me, what's the point? I don't want to hear about how it affects others because that just adds more guilt to what's already been a pretty shitty life and kinda makes me want to stop that guilt too because I wouldn't have to feel it. I know it's selfish and suicide is indeed probably the most selfish thing I can do. I get that.\n\nBut why oh why should *I* want to keep on living when my whole adult life has been a cycle of misery and promises to be more of the same.\n\nI know I shouldn't, right? In my head.

After much meditation, I decided to create this post, both as therapy for myself and to open up a forum of conversation. I am writing this right before I go to work, so I will probably edit it later. So here it goes. I apologize in advance for my rambling. \n\nI am currently 20 years old and a sophomore  in college. A few minutes ago I typed in \u201cI\u2019m eventually going to kill myself\u201d into google trying to find some forum post to read. Lo and behold an r/suicidewatch post came up from 3 years ago, which led to me creating my reddit account to make this post.\n\nThroughout my life so far, I have struggled from a crippling loneliness. I was mostly a loner in middle school and high school, one of those arrogant assholes who only care about grades, etc. Inside, however, I had a crippling insecurity about my body image. I have a distinct memory from when I was perhaps 10-11 of staring into the mirror and looking at my face, critiquing every last bit. To those I know, this would not make much sense as I have always been told that I am very attractive. I have never seen it, however. My phone, to this day, is filled with photos that I have taken of myself. \n\nDeep down, I think that my depression is mostly of a natural physiological basis. Up until I was 18 I had never even held a girl\u2019s hand and up to now I have only kissed one (a very pretty Italian girl who left the country soon after). I have spent most of the last 2 years listening to sad songs, driving aimlessly, chain smoking, and watching movies like Her and Manchester by the Sea. Luckily enough, I do have a best friend that I met in HS who struggles with depression as well. He however, has no problem picking up girls do to his charisma that he has developed over the years as a coping mechanism. Together, we mostly drink, smoke weed, and watch \u201cfilms.\u201d I always make it a point to get drunk or high enough that my entire life, past and future, flashes before me in a sort of slideshow. \n\nAs I write this, I have been using steroids on and off for 2.5 years. I first started after losing 25 pounds (mostly by starving myself) and then developing an ok physique. I thought that nothing else would make me attractive so I made the decision to buy Testosterone Enanthate off the darknet when I was 17. I didn\u2019t give a shit if I died because, in my mind, there was no other way to find a girl to fill the void inside of me. Now, I am very muscular (5\u201910\u2019\u2019, 190, around 10% bf), yet my void is not filled and I don\u2019t think it ever will be. \nI am on a solid trajectory right now and will inherit a large sum from my grandfather when I turn 25. This adds no meaning to my life, however. I see myself as a sort of Holden Caulfield or Amory Blaine (from this side of paradise). All I want to do is help people and be loved, but I have a crippling fear that I will only feel loved vicariously, by watching movies and reading books. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I won\u2019t make it past 40 before I eventually kill myself. My father is currently slowly dying of alcoholism from his depression at 50 just as his father did.\n\nEvery time I think of this I am taken back to a memory from when I was a senior in HS. I had been talking to a girl for a month or two and my best friend had hid the fact that he was having sex with her. I had never felt so inadequate in my life. I drove home crying and tied my belt around the doorknob and leaned forward. Thankfully I didn\u2019t follow through with it. This inadequacy still consumes me. I just want hope that someday these feelings will subside.", "I regret coming to medical school. My parents were always coercive, and I was timid.

Y'all are so kind for doing that. I miss kind people. Everyone leaves me 'cuz I'm depressed. And everytime I'm in my deepest point of a 'depression wave', somebody dies. Like life also tries to convince me I should kill myself.\n\nSo I heard in August I could go to a mental hospital in MARCH. So at that point it sounded so far away that I gave up and neglected myself. Cuz everyday was hell. And I was supposed to wait 6 months. **But** of course I was thankfull my psychiatrist got me on the list of the mental hospital that is specialised in autism. So I was too scared to really tell I wouldn't survive until then.\n\nI've been severe depressed in october. Didn't really come out of my room except for diner or to go to the toilet. Selfharmed the whole day long, slept when I was tired, not on a certain time so my sleep rythm was ruined. Gained weight. Couldn't concentrate on anything. Like I was in my mind already fading away. I became sure life was giving my signs that I should die. Everything that could go wrong, DID go wrong. And in my deepest point, my grandma died. I still haven't accept it. Her death didn't feel real for days. It was on the funeral where it felt like life punched me in the head. The amount of emotions were so much that I tried to not be in the reality anymore. Thinking about an alternate life. Writing stories and imagining me in it constantly.\n\nI think that last thing gave me a depersonalisation disorder or something. I don't know how it works and I know I can't diagnose myself. But on moments where I have a lot of emotions or when I'm a little stressed, I feel like I'm watching my body experiencing things. Like I'm the co\u00f6rdinator in my head watching through my eyes. I can't really talk or think cuz I feel like my body should talk or think in that situation. I'm just watching what happens and take decisions.\n\nAnd then late October... I was standing on the edge of the bridge and decided to talk to an old friend, instead of jumping at that moment. (She has DID, and one of her personalities is an agressive one who made me dissociate when she wanted me to kms). You can say she's a bad influence, but she's the only one still standing by me and the only one with the same kind of humor. She has help so the thing that happened last year won't happen again.\n\nAnyway, I became a little happier, started enjoying going outside again. I made friends in a therian community cuz I figured back in August I was a therian too. (whatever your opinion is about 'therians', pls dont post them here cuz this isnt what the post is about)\n\nIdk why, but I knew I was going into a depressed moment again, as I was irritated everyday and selfharming again.... So I landed in the depressed wave again. Or should I say drowning? I don't enjoy anything, every food tastes boring. I can't sleep cuz I cry every damn night. I'm constantly thinking about kms. I'm even trying it, or sort of searching boundaries. Taking pills but just enough to still stay alive. Or standing on the edge of the bridge but not jump.\n\nWhat triggered my to write this post, was because I heard a cat of mine has cancer and he may not survive another week. The cat that shoved his fur in my face :') so I got a little distracted in a traumatising situation which happened 2/3 years ago. (Can't talk about it now cuz PTSD flashbacks will kill me with this amount of emotions I have now) The cat that walks over my legs, jumps in my neck and demands attention when I'm crying on the floor in the middle of the night. He is like my ESA (not official one) And I'm about to lose him. I can't go through this. I can't lose the last string of the rope that I'm holding on the edge of a ravine. I feel like kms at the moment. I don't wanna die. I wanna be of this pain.\n\nAbout the mental hospital in march? 18 days until an apointment to talk about practical stuff. then I have to wait another week (I guess?) to finally be there and be save from myself.\n\nBut plz give me some strenght, some advice.

I am living alone in a small mobile home on my family's property. I am unable to have guests. I am unable to find work because I don't have transportation and other reasons.

The heater has been messed up all winter so I've been freezing. I have one blanket and one sheet. No pillows after they got infested with bed bugs.   \n\n\nAll I've eaten for the past three years are potatoes, macaroni and cheese and balogne sandwiches. I haven't been able to even leave the house in 3 years and the last time was for my moms funeral. I can't even shave my face or legs because I haven't had razers, shaving cream or anything in three years. I haven't had face wash. I've had the same bottle of shampoo for three years. I've had four bars of soap for the past three years... My kitchen sink doesn't work, I wash my one plastic bowl in the bathroom sink.  I don't speak to anyone. I'm essentially already dead. Although I doubt I get 2000 calories a day, the type of foods I've eat have made me gain at least 30 pounds and so none of my clothes fit me. I have one pair of stretchy pajama pants and two tshirts that fit me.  It could be worse, i could be homeless so I've kept this inside for this long but I'm tired. My life is really already over. I'm exhausted. After this month, I won't have internet and I am fairly certain with nothing to do at all, no music etc, I will go insane.

I am one of 10 children slotting in at number 7, I have been emotionally and physically abused by those who were supposed to nourish me.

I give myself these attributes because that\u2019s all I really am. I am afraid of the world horrified possibly I have ran out of classes (IN FUCKING UNI) because I felt as if everyone was looking on me I have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me. Insecure lol I don\u2019t even know what to say I have deleted everything on my social media\u2019s multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that I\u2019d prefer them not be there. Am I manipulative yes, but I don\u2019t understand how one can not be manipulative. I like to have things my way of course we all do but I know how to get it done I know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what I want because I had to learn to. I'm one of fucking 10 children and I showed up in the middle and this wasn\u2019t no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling, abusive and manipulative and I guess that\u2019s what I became, you are a product of your environment after all. I don\u2019t really know the purpose or direction of this as I have just stopped crying again (its 2:13pm) and decided fuck it imma do this so if I do kms at least maybe one mf\u2019er can know what I been trying to say.\n\nSo guys I think im going crazy this is a new development if you don\u2019t mind me starting here, I sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations (guess this is what happens when you don\u2019t get to train social skills). Sometime\u2019s I cry sometimes I get so angry I don\u2019t even know what to do and sometimes admittedly I feel straight up heart broken as if I have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly I was born into one family instead of another. I fantasize too much and I kind of sorta relate to people from Netflix series. Like Joe the stalker I get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them. Fortunately I can say I don\u2019t relate to him with his killing (that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier) instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on. \n\nFuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things I write.\n\nOk I think the logical thing to do is start with little stories from childhood and work my way to present day. \n\nI was born in 1998 in Africa and moved to the United Kingdom at a young age not sure how young because I don\u2019t remember. My dad had been previously married and had 5 children from his first wife and at this time only 3 from my mum me and my 2 brothers one a year older one a year younger. It\u2019s said that when I was born they thought I was a fucked up baby, I was going to be disabled or something of the sorts (not in a doctor said it way, but like I was born and they looked at me and said na this aint it way and little would you know my little brother was born just under 10 months later) Fantastic way to start life. So we all lived in one house when we first got to the UK (very vague memory of this shit by the way combination of what I've been told as fact and what I know to be true) So as a kid I have been described as a quiet and timid kid so quiet infact that my older brother and sister (age 12-14) (from a different mother) would pinch me or hit me to make me cry because when I would cry it was funny that I would make no noise.  I was also a huge fan of lion king asking them to watch it multiple times a day with me, everyday. We then moved a couple times memory all blurry and we arrived at the next destination that I remember. We lived in a flat in a small town in England for a couple years, my memories of this place are my   constantly injuring himself severly by playing out, dbz, Toonami, vegeta and ps2. I was a normal kid but I would get fucked up by my dad. (btw im around 4-6 years old) I still remember the time I was called downstairs just to be beaten I think for drawing a rude picture that was discovered after I had just been beaten. Boom boom not too much going on just the entrance to a life of suffering but not too much tbh.  \n\n\nWe then moved to a council house elsewhere just kids and mum because dad had decided its stressful to live with people so he\u2019d rather pay 1k+ rent elsewhere for his own place then help his family. These years weren\u2019t too bad though if anything they were my favourite because he wasn\u2019t around it was just us 3 years in that place from year 2- year 5. He would still drive down though on occasion just to hit us and then return to his home on the flip side of the uk. This was fantastic for my personal growth of course as I learnt that being a father means coming over shouting and arguing with your wife, beating your children and then cutting. And by beating I mean sure we were between ages 7/8-10 but he would hit us with all he had leave belt marks for days all over my body. To the extent the neighbour\u2019s would hear us screaming and would then mock us the next day as we walked to school. He then thought that we were becoming bad children (at the time me and all my siblings were top in our classes thanks to our mum keeping us up to study with her , as well as this at this age we started being forced to go to mosque mon- fri (5-7) and then over the weekends we would go to Arabic school and if we were at home we would play outside in the park so I don\u2019t know how bad we could of really been but who knows.(she was in college so while she did her homework she helped us with ours)). Actually with that being said I would steal from my mum not a lot and not everyday but a pound or 2 here and there just because everyone else in school could afford to buy things like sweets and toys and I would never be able to join in because I had none. I would come home from school and mums not in so id have to sit outside the house for a couple hours people would walk by but I had no friends house to go to like my brothers so I would just sit at the door and wait. My life has been hell maybe its easy from an outside view to say naa aint that bad but try live it everyday you come home aint no body even in, by the time everyone does get in its all at once no time for you and mum to talk no dad asking how was school bruh go to  sleep. To summarize though I was studying everyday 7 days a week and still being beaten along with my brothers but I had a newly born sister and it was time for the move to the big city so fuck it maybe its about to get better.Bruh I forgot and now remembered this nigga would look all 3 of us in the garage for whole days just because and the punishment for leaving would be you get beat and thrown back in there. Think about the mentally how much that would fuck you up you aint even fucking 10 yet.\n\nWhen we first got to this new city we were quick to discover its rough out there day one we were robbed. They were no more parks we could just go to play at so now I became and indoors kid. To go along with that now my dad didn\u2019t live too far away he was only in the neighbouring town so instead of monthly \u201cvisits\u201d it was now weekly. Fair enough to say within a year I had put on I don\u2019t know 10 maybe 15kg I was fat af going into year 7 but in year 6 I was a very thin framed kid. I was depressed and I'm not sure if I knew it but my life consisted of go to school and be bullied to come home and be beaten not knowing where my safe place was I chose solitude I learnt out of sight out of mind (didn\u2019t even work all the time but nigga I tried) My mum became pregnant again\u2026 (this was not necessary but I've grown to love the child) so now they are soon to be 5 kids and none of which already receive and adequate amount of love. Just to further paint the character of my father he beat my younger sister who was at the time maybe 3/4 because she took and hid his phone (later revealed he left it in his jacket pocket) NO APOLOGY HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN EVER IN HISTORY FOR A MISTAKEN BEATING. We spent little time in that house but what do ire member being dragged from under a bed to be beaten and being beaten nearly every morning without fail for 1/2  years for bed wetting (punches were not pulled).   \n\n\nWe moved again after same sort of thing really he\u2019d show up for a few days fuck up everyones mood and cut no one wanted him around but no body would say because everyone was afraid of getting beat again. This is the house I lived in when I decided ahh man maybe this life thing isn\u2019t for me went and sat at the window ledge in my room 3rd floor looking down and wished I could just let go. We would be locked in the attic this time the door is genuinely locked we couldn\u2019t get out if we wanted room was what 3x4 meters storage room basically and 3 of us had been locked in there for the whole day. Living in such circumstances created bitch nigga behaviour amongst us as brothers because the beatings were bad you did not want to be beaten it would fuck your whole shit up. So niggas started snitching bruh my own brother came in my room while I was learning to beat my meat took my phone took pictures of what I was watching and then showed everyone while I was sat in the living room\u2026 I was then promptly beaten. This the environment I grew up in even in your own fucking room you couldn\u2019t do shit you couldn\u2019t trust nobody and you were very likely going to be fucked up for anything you did. This could include but was not limited to holding your brothers hand while fighting\u2026 (that\u2019s gay apparently so you would be beaten). Defending yourself to your parents (Its rude to speak back so I was beaten), Not speaking (its rude to not speak when spoken to so I was beaten). Finishing the milk bruh imagine your 12 year old hungry self wanted some cereal finished it and then gone beaten for it that was my fucking life. Id go to school this fat unloved ugly kid, (I think this is a good time to point out I went to a bad school in a white neighbour hood and as we all know aint nothing scarier than poor white people jk\u2026) but those guys were harsh to me day one of highschool I had a fight why because I was being racially abused, I was constantly racially abused I was not even accepted by my own race because I wasn\u2019t black enough (I am quarter white 3 quated black so skin color dark brown meant I was a paki, I was an Indian I was a terrorist osama bin laden was my uncle so on and so forth) aint no body ever gave a shit about me not a single teacher not no body. And this is where things get fucked up for me this when I started doing dumb shit I started being a prick to my friends not fully understanding what was even going on but just thinking out of I gotta cover my back I gotta make sure I aint no punk but in reality it made me into a punk. But ill get to that later. I still remember everything nice people have ever said to me that I felt was said genuinely though, once the most popular kid in school told me to not let anyone pick on me and just tell them im not Asian although I had tried both I felt his sincerity and very much appreciated it and still think about it to this day. \n\nI wanna fast forward now to year 11 when shit really hits the fan, I moved to a school which was mixed gender (years 7-10 I was in a boy school) and the introduction of women had definitely caught my eyes (hadn\u2019t seen them in many years since everyday was school mosque home runescape repeat maaaaaaaaaan FUCK THAT SHIT that\u2019s the worst childhood and to make it better slide a couple hundred beatings in over those 3 years and now you might be beginning to get a grasp on who I am as a person. Of course they are little moments when things workout but not really. To summarise I was in love or atleast I felt like I was I did horribly on my exams which at the time I accreted to me just focusing my time on her and not myself and that started the downwards spiral. My little brother told my parents I wasn\u2019t fasting at prom (I have not ever fasted a day since, pretty sure I gave up on religion a long time ago but that\u2019s its own thing) and I was beaten then locked in the house so I could not attend my final meeting for NCS (I had saved up my 5 a week for 10 weeks to pay the 50 to go and now I just couldn\u2019t imagine that feeling I was going to finally be away from this whole home all summer and now I couldn\u2019t why because my dad who had now moved in full time had decided to spite me).  \n\n\nThe summer of finishing high school of enjoyment had arrived my plans to be with my friends had been put to a halt. My plans of going to a top 3 college in the city had been put to a halt. My summer was instead me just sitting in my room everyday the whole summer alone not talking to anyone for multiple days at a time. This is when my solitude became serious I became an awkward nervous rek after this I couldn\u2019t even talk to people properly without overthinking everything id say if summer was 10 days long I was beaten on 6/7 days as well so yh torture house and to make it better I had no friends because we moved so fucking much I didn\u2019t know a single person and couldn\u2019t get to know them because we lived in a jewish neighbour hood and if you\u2019ve ever lived in one as the only black muslim family you aint going to have no friend. But yh returned to college and it was ok except for everyday I would come home and be locked out of my house everyday without fail my dad would sit in the kitchen looking out the window and laugh at me having nowhere else to go so I would sit in the gardens storage cupboard nothing much at all probably just a big wardrobe but It was dry. I would then go to college and repeat this process day by day mentally exhausting my self little by little more once again through in beatings on.4 out of every 10 days and you have the image of what my first year of college was like. My parents decided as a family we should read the quran together (muslim people book not all of it like a page each a day) so I read my page and left and while I was goning upstairs I heard him talking about me so I decided ah im probably going to be beaten let me stay here and wait so I did and soon enough I heard him say \u201cwhy did he read that page, he read that a few days ago hes looking for the easy ones\u201d so my mum said \u201cill call him back down and he can read again\u201d, I was called \u201c\u2026.. come downstairs and read again\u201d and I replied \u201cWhats the point nothing I do is good enough for him anyway\u201d to which he responded by walking into the kitchen getting a metal pole and coming to hit me with it. The best bit for him it was a detached house so no one could even hear my screams. At first I tried to block with my left arm and then I just couldn\u2019t hold it up anymore so I switched to the right and the same happened so then I was just lying there being beaten by my dad with a metal pole bleeding all over the floor from my head and when he thought he was done he left. This day is the day I lost my shit as soon as I could stand I went and grabbed a knife but was stopped by my mother (I always found it funny how she would always come to stop me but never him). I then called the police when they arrived they was so much blood on the ground floor corridor that she threw shoes over to hide it because it could not be cleaned while he sat there on the sofa smug knowing he had gotten away with it my mum had hidden me from the police and that was that another great day in the life. \n\nI had become sick of it and told my mum I do not care what she thinks I am tired and I am leaving I will go to foster care if I must but I am not dealing with this shit anymore (I don\u2019t know if its important but I was also 17 without a phone or laptop or any communication with the outside world, if I was in my room all day I was playing badminton against the wall staring at the ceiling or creating fantasies in my mind to rescue me from where I was currently) I told her ill get a job (just received ni number) ill figure it out for myself and what did she do?\n\nShe said nothing for maybe a month and then we were moving house so she came in one morning and just told me we are moving pack up so I did thinking we are moving away from that cunt and she had chosen me her son over her manipulative controlling abusive husband\u2026 Instead she had rented another place and just dropped me off there would come round maybe every month or 2 for an hour or so and that was my life. Now I was completely secluded and this was the first time I actually tried to kill myself I had a panic attack the anxiety just got to me I took all my sleeping pills at once and boom I woke up the next day\u2026 they were all fucking natural herbal things and they couldn\u2019t do shit. Bummer I know. She still doesn\u2019t know about this I continued thinking about killing my self shit I never stopped from that first time till now but It was just thoughts and ideas I had finally tried to and failed. Instead I started smoking weed which would help sometimes but other times like I learnt the hardway it would make me think about my life and whats actually happened and compare it to my peers around me and I would breakdown crying. My life has no direction, I have no family around me (which is ironic in a family of 13(3 parents 10 kids))because we had all been tormented soo much we didn\u2019t know to look out for eachother we had to look out for our selves first. This is why im selfish I cant afford to not be because if im not my own number 1 In terms of in a greedy way like If I don\u2019t look out for ME first no one else will. My mum then told me she didn\u2019t want to continue paying for where I lived and I had to find somewhere else (now that I was 18/19) which is a real bitch because if I had just done what I wanted to years back and left this family of suffering I would have been alright but instead now im going to college everyday thinking about where tf am I going to live. So I dropped out of college to work, I ended up returning to college having to restart living in a city different to the one I studied in working night shifts to then go straight in to class but I figured it out. Got to uni and guess what I don\u2019t know what the fuck is going on. \n\nEveryone is social and I don\u2019t know how to socialise sometimes I feel as though I stand out so badly that im just not supposed to be there im surrounded by people who life has blessed people who have seen the world people whos parents love them soo much that they even come to watch them train at uni. In my whole fucking life there has never been a single thing I've done which I can say I looked into the crowd and had a single person there to support me. Instead I have been told to dream is free, I've been told your not going to make anything with your life and you are going to be a failure. Honestly I have accepted these as truths now. I don\u2019t even feel like myself anymore I feel stupid as if i took a couple too many hits to the head information doesn\u2019t sink in properly anymore. I'm embarraced in class because everyone else knows what they are doing to some level I have no fucking idea everyone else goes home for Christmas or there family comes to visit. LOOOL my family don\u2019t give a single fuck. I AM ALONE IN THIS WORLD TIRED DEPRESSED AND READY TO GO. I accepted death a little while back, one night I was lying in bed crying and realised I don\u2019t have to deal with this anymore I really don\u2019t I have accepted I will kill myself and I am just waiting for the day in which I get my final little nudge to step of the ledge.\n\nI just want to be at peace.\n\nI also had a girlfriend for a while she cheated on me so I stopped valuing her as a person and just kept her for the other stuff. She even got pregnant and aborted it. I'm 20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestion\u2026 am I crazy for feeling like this?

I had been waiting so fucking long for this. I feel so fucking dysphoric all the fucking time I hate my body so fucking much. I just want enough testosterone to at least make my voice a little deeper.

But I\u2019m failing at life, really want to die, and am too embarrassed to explain to the people closest to me that I would rather die than proceed with my futile attempts at life. So here I am, on reddit, for some unknown fucking reason. I guess I just need to vent and this seems like the best place because I\u2019m sure no one I know will look here. So here it goes\n\nI\u2019m 23. Live in my parents basement with an amazing girl that I really don\u2019t deserve. Most of my life I\u2019ve been the quiet kid. Most people were scared of me in school because of that, but I\u2019m too much of a pussy to actually do anything. Only reason anyone would talk to me was because I played football and went to school with most of my team. \n\nFrom elementary school through middle school I was really fucking ugly. Acne was terrible, huge fucking nose, no confidence. Had like 2 encounters with girls during this time period and I was a hardcore \u201cnice guy.\u201d Those 2 encounters were enough for everyone to realize I\u2019m pretty fucking retarded. So most people avoided me. High school I peaked. (and by peak I really don\u2019t mean much. Just the time that I wasn\u2019t absolutely pathetic) Met the girl I\u2019m with now, got in really good shape and did pretty good in football. Managed to get fucking C\u2019s all throughout though so I got no scholarship for college. \n\nAfter high school my parents were amazing enough to pay for my college. 5000 fucking dollars a semester for me to do average my first semester then fail calculus my second semester. After my second semester I let my father convince me that I should go to school closer to home and do electrical engineering. First semester I did average. Next semester I failed fucking Chemistry and lab. Semester after that I failed my chemistry lab again so I had to switch to Computer engineering. Semester after that I failed Pde\u2019s. Pretty much every semester after that I\u2019ve failed classes. Not because I\u2019m not learning the material but because I\u2019m so fucking lazy I don\u2019t do half the homework. Usually my homework grades suck but my test scores are good but not good enough to keep me from failing. Every year my parents keep telling me that they are going to make me move out and pay for my own school, but they keep giving me more chances and I keep royal fucking those chances. Honestly don\u2019t understand why they give me so many chances. \n\nAnyways, this year isn\u2019t any different. Last semester I took 3 fucking classes (9 credit hours) and failed all three of my classes. Worst I\u2019ve ever done. So this current semester I\u2019m retaking 2 of the 3 I failed and just had to withdraw from one of them and the other I will probably get a C in. I don\u2019t get it. I have a part time job at fucking Chili\u2019s, I live at home, have everything going for me; don\u2019t have to worry about expenses, amazing girlfriend, family that loves me. Yet I can\u2019t fucking pass two fucking classes.\n\nI\u2019m a failure. Honestly no other explanation. I get to tell my mother that after this semester I am dropping out and moving out, therefore waisting 50,000$ of her money. Thing is, if I can\u2019t pass two fucking classes how the fuck an I suppose to live on my own. Other thing is, I wouldn\u2019t be on my own, my girlfriend would be with me which makes everything worse because I would be dragging her down with me. So instead of moving out I have decided I should probably just kill myself. I\u2019ve planned it out for the most part. I have a 30-06 in my room that guarantees my death, I\u2019ve scouted a place out where no one will be able to find my corpse. I haven\u2019t written my goodbye letter because I\u2019m honestly too pathetic to write one and probably won\u2019t even leave one, I plan on depositing all of my money into an account that my girlfriend has access to so she can get out of this house as quickly as possible if need be, etc...\n\nI know my death will negatively impact those closest too me but I\u2019m almost positive my parents will get over it. Honestly my father has given up on me so I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll care much. My grandparents will be devastated but they will get over it.\nOnly one I\u2019m worried about is my girlfriend. She\u2019s about to start a new job right when I plan on killing myself and I don\u2019t want to ruin that. I\u2019m sure I can figure something out.\n\nAt the same time. I really don\u2019t want to die. It still breaks my heart that I have to leave everything behind. My family has two amazing dogs that I would die for, I managed to go out with a girl way out of my league for 5 years that\u2019s about to get a job relevant to her dream career, I have grandparents, aunts, and uncles that all seem to like me, etc...\n\nGuess I\u2019ll just bring a couple bottles to try and get over that heartbreak so I can pull the trigger.\n\nAnyways, sorry to start my own fucking pity party. It was just hurting me to not say or write anything before I die since I\u2019ve done relatively good at hiding my depression from everyone. \n\nThank you for reading.", "I feel really suicidal I was at Sagres \u2014the end of the world\u2014 today, and all I really wanted to do was jump of the cliff into the water.

Never really wrote about myself online but I\u2019m very curious and the stigma behind death seems to discourage discussion of it. I\u2019ve actively tried talking to my family and a therapist about my perception of my life but their inability to understand that it does not and never has stemmed from depression irritates me. \n\nI want to die. I believe that death is the ultimate end goal for every single human being and rapidly increasing its approach would lead me to the end. Please note, I have a social life. I have close friends at college and at work. I also have a pretty active socia life (I go to a couple parties here and there). I\u2019m in a solid relationship (been together for two years now), and I do not abuse drugs or alcohol, only at kick backs or something. I do not have depression, I\u2019m pretty laid back down to earth guy who has never had any mental illness nor any thoughts of worthlessness, extreme sadness etc. \n\nPersonally, the meaningless within life is the main motivator for my methodology. Realistically, the now is true living (due to its value, the past you can\u2019t change and the future is unknown). Past the now, life is to be, not happening. Work, sex, love, entertainment, etc. are used to keep individuals living but what for? We work a 9-5 job, we have kids, we do all of these things and yet the reasoning boils down to survival and entertainment. entertainment to keep us looped within an endless cycle of netflix shows or games or tv shows or youtube and survival of work to eat and feed the future generation. realistically, love is a chemical compound effect which sparks to motivate the production of kids. to continue the species. the love of a parent to a child is to prevent child hood death so the child can become a parent and produce more children for the cycle to continue. when you really boil down what life is it\u2019s just an endless cycle of continuation within a species. \n\nIdk i\u2019m just curious if anyone else feels this way. You develop your own meaning in life but that meaning isn\u2019t even yours. You are taught that meaning through society and social interactions. Your parents develop that meaning for you and you believe it\u2019s yours but in reality it isn\u2019t. The pursuit of a good job or a big house or to produce music or to be a serial killer all of these perceptions you learn from society in which you incorporate into your definition of life. how you want to live isn\u2019t even your own perception it\u2019s just a jumble of social expectations mixed into you.\n\nIf anyone can help me understand this it\u2019d be a great help.

I'm so confused that I can't even write a proper text begging for help, a very simple act can become so complex and overwhelming to me.  \nI'll try to write this as coherent as possible but since english isn't my main language and I seem to have lost all my intelligence, so please forgive me if It starts getting confusing.\n\nSo basically, I have no idea what to do, my depression is getting so bad that I don't see any other way out besides ending it all. I feel no pleasure what so ever, not even masturbating gives me any pleasure. I feel like shit on a daily basis, from overwhelming sadness, anxiety and rage to paranoia, overwhelming suicidal thoughts and even homicidal thoughts. I don't want to hurt anyone besides myself thought. I'm such a failure, I'm 18 and still a virgin, I'm fat and all the freaking times I joined the gym I found myself just giving up weeks later. I have no social skills, or better yet no skills AT ALL. All my life I was illuded by my teachers, parents and friends into thinking that I was smarter than average, and the worst thing is that was the only good thing I saw on me, but I'm not smart at all, I'm just a dumb piece of shit. I tried everything I could to treat my depression but nothing seems to work, meditation (minimum of 30 minutes per day), medication (multiple antipsychotics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines), psychedelic drugs (LSD, magic mushrooms, DMT, you name it I probably tried it). I go to a psychologist and psychiatrist but I feel no better, probably worse than when it all started, the worst part is that I don't even remember when and how it started. Now I wouldn't say I abuse drugs that much, I mainly smoke a bit of weed every now and then, mostly weekends, and regarding psychedelics I done them rarely and with every bit of damage reduction I could think of, perhaps I did indeed disrespect them a bit (mostly taking them without prior planning leading to uncomfortable sets and settings) since I can't enjoy them anymore, I panic and my mind instantly tells me to take xanax or any benzo I can get my hands on. However I DID abuse Xanax, so much so that I ended up on the hospital a couple times for taking too much of it and blacking out, while in school which just fucked my reputation in school. My friends tried to help me as much as they could, but my mind is so fucked and confused that nothing seems to help. This text is getting long but I still have so much to say, I'll try to not make it too long so you don't get bored quickly. My grades are down the hill, I'm currently in 12th grade and about to fail, and honestly I CAN'T stand another year at that school, I rather hang myself than go through that again, specially since I live in an isolated island in the middle of nowhere and resources are very limited here, there's nothing to do here and there's no chance I'm getting a girlfriend here (or anywhere to be honest, nobody would love a fat piece of shit like me).\n\nLife is unbearable, I see no reason to stay alive, all I do all day is playing fcking LoL and let me tell you I hate that game so much, makes my blood boil and gives me urges to just cut my wrists. I can't make basic math/physics/chemistry/etc.. which just makes me feel even worst, cuz I need it to get to college, but I don't understand shit in school, since I can't study or focus, my mind just bombards me with horrible thoughts that echo in my mind till I put myself to sleep, I have no control over my mind anymore. I started learning guitar, and ended up giving up. I tried to learn how to program, but It's too overwhelming and I'm starting to lose any motivation I had for it (not that I had much motivation in general).\n\nHere's some backstory, when I was a kid I got shot in my eye with a air pressure carabine, which left me with about 10% vision on said eye, made me get fat cuz I couldn't do exercise for about 2-3 years and I ended up getting a bad lifestyle in general, all day in computer playing games. This combined with more trauma I went throught and my midly toxic family, lead to me becoming the disgusting person I could think of. I know this is getting too much information and confusing please forgive me, I'm retarded.\n\nRight now all I can think of is how to kill myself, I've tried it before with pills but ended up failing, so this time I'm thinking of hanging myself, and will do it eventually.\n\nJust thinking of all this makes my blood boil, I Hate life so much, I hate my fucking family, I hate my fucking school, I hate myself, I wanna shoot myself in the head and end it all.", "Do the suicidal thoughts ever really end? I\u2019ve been combatting them for years and they are so strong they prevent me from being a functional member of society. I\u2019ve (sort of) attempted suicide twice within the last 8 years. And I wish I just went more balls deep with it when I did. \n\nI\u2019ve been inpatient in mental hospitals, I\u2019ve done IOP programs, PHP programs, DBT, CBT, etc. for over 13 years and even after following all of these things I\u2019ve learned, the suicidal thoughts always win. I\u2019ve been on prescription after prescription and some may help lessen the frequency but they never actually go away. \n\nI can\u2019t tell my therapist (or any professional) these things because I\u2019ll instantly be admitted. I\u2019m already $1000+ in debt with medical bills from hospitalizations and therapy, and I can\u2019t afford another useless admission. All hospitalizations are is just a cash grab and a reason to house suicidal people and bankrupt them while profiting off of their health insurance. \n\nI don\u2019t even have the energy or willpower to go to work anymore. But my boss will fire me if I miss another day of work. But I can\u2019t go to the doctors to get a doctor\u2019s note or provide any excuse as to why I didn\u2019t come in or else I\u2019ll be hospitalized. I don\u2019t care if I get evicted and lose my cats and all my belongings and have to live out of my car. I just can\u2019t function in a work environment when feeling this way. \n\nIt just feels like a vicious circle/catch 22 that I can\u2019t seem to fucking break. Everyone around me just calls me weak and leaves me because I\u2019m such a burden. I\u2019ve always had this small fear in me of the \u201ckilling myself\u201d process - the fear of feeling my skull hit the pavement if I jump off of a building; or the fear of feeling myself asphyxiating as a noose constricts all blood flow and airflow to my brain; or the fear of feeling all my organs shut down before my brain does if I overdose. But lately, those fears are becoming less and less of an issue where I\u2019d rather just bite the bullet and be done with it.", "He cancelled our wedding 4 months away from the date... I dont know what to do anymore. I was 4 months away from getting married to my best friend of 10 yrs! He says he doesn't know what he wants . Everything was fine. He was actively planning the wedding with me, calling me his fiancee and handing out save the dates. He says he needs time, so I left the house and next week it'll be 1 month of our separation. Everyone is saying \"its better that it happened now vs later\" but it still hurts like hell. I ask for a reason to all of this and he says he doesnt know himself. He posts on instagram that he had to use 100% of his energy to let me go and that i will be happier with someone else. But the thing is I dont want anyone else and i will always choose him. I told him that and he doesnt say anything except not to push him. I love him so much and my heart feels like its going to explode and i feel like dying everyday! I know there are worse things that are happening in the world, and i feel stupid for saying this but i would rather die than to be without him. Not all relationships are perfect, yes we had our issues but we always found a way to work it out. This time around it really CAME OUT OF NO WHERE, it literally blindsided me. I feel crushed and i find myself just going through the motions as to not alarm my family, but I just cant do it anymore. I need my best friend back, I need the love of my life back....I cant tell anyone how i feel because they instantly tell me he is an idiot for leaving you and that i will find someone else. But i dont want anyone else.

I've lived a perfectly good life, had loving parents, was never bullied, whatever. Right now I have plenty of friends, a decent social life. I have no excuse for feeling how I feel and I just constantly beat myself up for it. Yet here we are, me just doing drugs every night and eating shitty food in the hopes that they'll kill me faster. Pretty much given up on college, no clue how I'm ever gonna graduate, but not like it matters since I'm not doing anything with my life anyway. Next phase is to get some dead end job till death finally comes. Not much to look forward to. Would have offed myself long ago if it wasn't for my parents, I can't give them the pain of losing their only child to suicide. I also don't wanna hurt my friends, but I'm doing a pretty good job of distancing myself from them so that probably won't be an issue in the future. Living for others sucks, but I mean, what other choice do I have?  I'm definitely not gonna live for myself when the time comes.\n\nSo here I am just patiently waiting death. For the most part I've stopped feeling anything. Some days (today) it just hits me like a train, but I usually wake up, just lumber through the whole day doing what's \"expected\" of me, all fake smiles and funny jokes to make people think that I'm normal. Then I come back, waste time with videos games or drugs, sleep, rinse and repeat. I've tried to start a hobby, but I always lose motivation, try to talk to people, but only exchange empty words. Don't see my condition improving in any way (not like it's possible anyway). Life sucks, it always has and always will. I just really hope that I don't get the chance to make it to 30 years.\n\nI despise this cycle, I hate that you're forced to participate, and I hate that people tell you that you're the one with \"a problem\" for thinking that things shouldn't be this way. Isn't it cruel to keep someone in misery when relief is so easily available? But of course, forcing them to suffer is obviously the moral choice here. So I guess suffer I will, cause apparently society decided that this was the right choice. \n\nIn short, all I'm looking forward to is the day that I'll be able to kill myself guilt free, hope it'll come sooner rather than later.", "I won't be able to withstand this forever I just finished half of my current career... Pretty much four semesters, and almost nothing has changed.\n\nBeing honest, I've been trying to hold on for three and a half years after that Asperger misdiagnosis, but eventually it becomes unbearable... I keep thinking that some people treat me in a more child like way, or as if I were disabled, or just talking to me when we are face or face or for college stuff, but no more than that.\n\nMy mom has been trying to understand, but she says it's difficult, because she's a more self sufficient person, and she doesn't understand why I'm so obsessed with friendship.\n\nNow I'll go to my psychologist in a few days, and I don't know how to make her understand as well... Sometimes, I think my problem isn't something that can be fixed by just believing in myself.\n\nIt's the main reason I want to die, it's the main reason I lost a lot of things and people in these past years...

My mother is verbally abusive, and when I call out for help with the few close friends I have left, she says I'm lying and she'll call me out and ruin my life. Now, I don't even know if I'm lying or not. If I am, just ignore this then. I really don't know anymore. Everyday, I'm so confused. I have no right to be proud of anything, and because I go to a really tough high school, often I don't have the time to practice violin (but I do a lot of competitions and honor orch, etc. so yeah not good) and yanno, college applications are coming up and I don't think I have anything to show. I do homework during class so I can finally relax during lunch, but I tell my mom I do homework during lunch to avoid getting my ass kicked. She compulsively checks my phone and reads my texts (more than I have my phone, her reason is that my parents bought it and not me), goes through my stuff and takes it, then tells me she did nothing of the sort, and yet I'm the crazy horrible reputation ruining liar here.

I just don't know what to do, because even though I'm just a teenager, I could probably say my boyfriend is the only person I'd want to spend life with if things work out (I've dated before and so has he). But as of now, I'm giving everyone aneurysms or something dealing with me and getting mad at me. My violin and sports are doing basically nothing because I don't have time or energy and this generation is pretty damn good at this stuff. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I know my boyfriend probably would have a really hard time dealing with the fact that I was gone, for a very long time. I've been debating ending the relationship to make it easier on him.\n\nI'm sorry, I don't know what to ask of y'all. Just please help me. I'm talked out. I just don't know anymore.

Okay look man I'm honestly speechless But I need you to understand my perception I thought that you were just up to ur usual antics and I thought u were begging for attention, and I decided to not give you that attention. You aren't gonna believe me but I am honestly truly sorry if you felt and continue to feel this way I mean I never wanted any of this, I was led to believe that you had gone mad and I had to leave it at there Suicide is stupid by the way, I have considered that for myself in the past and I'm telling you it does not go well because those who have acted on that literally destroy their loved ones.

Considering doing it tonight I'm nearly 23 years old. My father abandoned our family when I was 14. He was my best friend at the time... I haven't seen him in 6 years. This void made me become extremely close to my few friends. My clinginess reached a point where they got fed up from me and my anxiety and paranoia, that I've now lost my closest friends. I used to reach out to them for help, but it reached a point where everything was on their shoulders and they couldn't handle it anymore, so they distanced themselves with time.  \nI used to be more fit and more attractive, but my life has taken a downwards spiral. I've gained about 70 lbs and my self-consciousness eats me up on the inside. My anxiety is through the roof and I have no motivation to do anything anymore.

It will break her, but also I know that once she finds out, my life will probably turn into more of a hell, as she's always had extremely high standards for me. \n\nI'm still a virgin.

I can't deal with this anymore.\n\nI moved away from my hometown 3 years ago for university. I haven't made a single new friend. I live alone. I literally don't use my voice anymore because I have no one to talk to. It reaches the point where I talk to myself because I'm scared that if I go without talking for so long that I will lose my voice.

In my case my dad spent my childhood promising to *help* me pursue a science career if I moved in with him, along with many other exorbitant promises. He then coaxed me into signing my life savings over to him under the guise of him teaching me money management skills. Afterwards his personality instantly changed like he had been replaced with a body snatcher:\n\nHe started holding my money hostage to control me. He forced me into a flat earth fundamentalist church. He started incessantly discouraging my scientific interests. I was forbidden from me from even being seen with a girl since it might lead others to think we were sexually active. He threatened to cut me off if I ever associated with members of so many demographics that I was functionally unable to have friends. He would scream at me and belittle and humiliate me for hours every day. His church was so strict that I had to give up most of my hobbies for being \"sinful\". He tried to damage my relationships with all of my other family members. He would constantly follow me around and would incessantly act out for attention so much that I struggled to even attempt my schoolwork or even my remaining hobbies. I was quickly so psychologically broken that I started failing my classes despite growing up an honors student. \n\nA few years later, I took on a second major hoping to raise my GPA and just barely squeak into grad school. Dad took this to somehow mean that I was \"on the verge of graduating with two PhDs\". He completely flipped from incessantly discouraging me to exerting 24/7 pressure to graduate with those two PhDs *immediately*. I explained over and over that I wasn't getting two PhDs, but he wouldn't accept it. Despite my protests he spread word far and wide about my \"two PhDs\" and I gained a reputation as some kind of miracle prodigy that I could never actually live up to. By this point Dad was in the final stages of terminal heart problems and was so relentless in his pressure that I started going along with it because even after all his years of lies and abuse I didn't want to disappoint him on his death bed.\n\nYears went by and things continued to get worse for me. I was overwhelmed with preemptive grief over dad's impending death every day. I went through a traumatic religious deconversion and lost my soul-sustaining (nonfundamentalist) faith in God. I started experiencing severe diabetes symptoms. I was struggling with the increased course load and failing to recover my grades as Dad continued to sink deeper and deeper into an obsession with those completely imaginary PhDs. One day dad started taking me to visit some old man from his crazy cult who was bedridden from his own terminal heart problems. \n\nMore years went by and both dad and the old guy were both alive. That meant that Dad had been in the final stages of terminal illness for something like 6 years. I realized that he had been outrageously exaggerating his health problems and that I had spent the last several of them going along with his delusional nonsense\n\n\nFuck it, I'm tired.

I'm dependent on a longtime SO and it makes me feel awful. There have been elements of abuse in the past and I dont think I can fully trust anyone, so I have to do this or die or get a high paying job without a degree or hurting my back(I have a terrible back and neurological problems) I'll be left with something like stripping, or just suicide.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, classes are getting more intense, I'm already behind in an online class that posted no deadlines, because I'm prioritizing a class in which I work around 30 hours/week to keep my quality high(I'm aiming for A's and this class is supposedly graded harshly-so far I have A's and 1 B on something I worked on for just 10 hours). Anyway, so I am behind in my online classes now, trying to make time to catch up, but seems impossible.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy other in person class doesn't take as much time, I have a 4 hour studio and homework takes me maybe 1-5 hours usually. I have trouble managing time because I hardly see my SO, so when we do see each other, we stay up late and just play games. We havent had any intimacy in about a month, and otherwise it's like a 1-2x/month thing. He doesn't help me with the chores unless I ask a bunch of times even though i made a chore chart for us both to look at,on the fridge, and gave myself more things. He keeps promising he'll do chores,shower,brush his teeth, just basic things, and he doesn't. He actually said he'd do all the chores when I went back to school(like I'd done for him) and not to worry. I worried, but I left things for a bit and realized I was correct in being concerned after the house started looking trashed. If I talk to him he changes the topic or recites some meme. He kisses me maybe twice a day and is otherwise glued to his phone watching YouTube videos- he quit video games as they were time consuming but just switched to videos instead. He's so addicted to his phone that he got his by a bus last year, while I was passenger. He's usually on his phone while driving and there's nothing I can do. I dont drive because of my anxiety, and I dont have a working car. I am very stressed right now and feel totally alone. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI literally dont have time to see a therapist. I dont even have time to see my doctors for checkups. All I do is work, at school,homework,and at home. I am painfully shy and awkward and have no friends. I've joined a few clubs to make friends but it seems impossible; people try to befriend me it seems, and I just don't know how to interact.  I had an amazing conversation with another top performer in my class with the difficult work and anticipated becoming friends- she tries, but I dont know how to reciprocate and I can tell that I make things uncomfortable because I react as if we never started forming a friendship, if that makes sense. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn my other class there is one kid who has tried to befriend me. He has autism and comes across pretty brash. I try to remind myself that he has a condition and to not take things personally, but sometimes I can't help it and I feel terrible and other times he is just too close and I feel awkward. I think he seems genuinely friendly and most of the time I dont mind him, but I guess I'm just under so much stress at this point that everything is getting to me. The whole class is also pretty distracting, which again, is usually bearable but the stress is wearing me out and there's 0 things I can do to relieve it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYesterday I got a grade back from a quiz and just a friendly note to try to speak up more during critique(I'm a design student, so this is an art class). I made a mental note to make sure to speak up during critique last night, and then I panicked. First I panicked because I wanted to be done my painting beforehand- I hadn't planned properly and am always the slow one in everything, so I kept messing up and didn't finish in time. It seemed I was one of 2 others who hadn't finished so that made me feel a little better. Critique came and the aforementioned kid stood next to me as he always does, uncomfortably close, and then in front of me and I couldn't see the paintings. Panic increased and I didn't want to be rude so I didn't say anything. I planned for what shouldve been my painting for critique and was called out of order and further panicked. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have a disorder that causes dissociation under stress and I have social anxiety. So when I panic, my mind goes blank. This happened a few days ago; my dog is unfortunately aggressive with 1 dog in my neighborhood. She is a strong dog and fortunately until this point, it had only been my bf who had experienced this. She lunged at the dog and I wasnt strong enough to pull her back, I panicked,mind went blank, and I just stood there. In my mind, the only thing i could think was like, the idea or feeling of alarm, but I couldn't speak or move. The neighbor didn't seem to mind and gave the dogs treats, but I felt so terrible. I don't know how to fix this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDuring the critique, my mind was blank and I didn't know what to say. I absorbed things others had said, but my mind flushed them out when I tried to speak. Speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me. I guess I'm just stupid. I usually think for a long time before I speak, and I can think and write, but I dont know how to think+speak quickly or at once. I just felt like crying and couldn't wait to just pack up and start on my drawing assignment(until I realized I'd forgotten my most important supplies).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI grew up with abusive parents. My dad was pretty absent, working a lot, but when he was home he was a complete ass. He would constantly provoke me. My older brother harshly picked on me. My mom did the most damage, somehow. I grew up thinking she was \"good cop\", she taught me to think that. She could do no wrong, she was perfect, she was always right. If she was upset with me, even if seemingly unreasonable, I did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it. Example: I didn't intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didn't understand? I'm a bad person who doesn't love mom. \nMoms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades? I'd be her psychiatrist and beg her to come out,reason with her why she should. Eventually I realized I didn't have to say anything. Eventually still, I realized that I could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway. I did once, around 6 or 7 and I guess she talked and I didn't respond, so she came literally running after me, cornered me, and yelled down at me for not loving her.\n&amp;nbsp;\nI have an eating disorder? \nI'm \"evil\", I'm a \"dirty slut\" even though I'm not allowed out of the house- this must be because of how I look or something I've done- am I that person? Mom says so, so i guess so. \n&amp;nbsp;\nAs a young child, I was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often. I'd cry myself to sleep every night because I thought my mom was mad at me. Every day, I'd be to blame for something. Once, I even got blamed for my dad losing $100. I don't even know why. My mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me, with the neighborhood kids all outside, telling me I'd better bring the $100 back right now. So then my friends assumed I was a thief(cause a 9 y/o who can't drive and never goes anywhere has a reason for money is definitely wont get caught with random money at some point \ud83d\ude44). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt some point, around 9, I started self harming because I didn't understand what I had apparently done. I was upset for always being such an apparent major cause of my mother's pain- the person I did love most in the world no matter what she thought.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy parents destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies I guess. I planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and GTFO. I was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day. I begged to be homeschooled- my plan was to be able to focus on my schooling without bullies and graduate early to get away from my family. I was in 2nd grade my first year homeschooling and skipped up to grade 5 work in everything but math, which I got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work. My parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester. So I'd be in public school in august for a few months, then homeschooled. Obviously this ruined my extra work I'd done and I became discouraged. In 7th grade, I began having a lot of trouble with math. My mom refused to help me, saying I had learning disability and just couldn't learn so to not do it(and then help my lovely, psychotic step sister instead). She'd do this to me at public school too, and I'd often go in humiliated having to explain that I couldn't finish my homework. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt one point, I wasn't allowed outside(my grandparents had moved in) and due to that and all the stress, I embraced being reclusive. I told myself I wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd, my mom would huff back at them before I could speak, saying that not everyone has to have friends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd now I'm this. Looking back, I remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people, wanting me all to herself. At the time I thought it was ridiculous, but now I see he was right; she needed me to soothe her, to blame for everything, to be there in misery with her. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI got older, decided that I wanted to try being social, so I'd say yes to every single opportunity. Every one. That was a terrible idea and I ended up being abused by a few predatory opportunists, which in turn caused me major anxiety, more than ever before, and I became more reclusive than ever before. I havent held a stable job in a while. Havent had friends since that time, about 10 years ago. I've been with my SO, who has been abusive off and on. Things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago, and now they've been very off and on. For a few years again, things have been pretty good as far as that goes, but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA couple years ago I found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution, stripping, drugs, or suicide. I mass applied to jobs but when I'd receive a response, I was never qualified for anything but retail which I've had bad experiences with and it doesn't pay enough. I stopped eating, became an alcoholic with the little funds I had, and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight. I almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and I was sent to the hospital. Things didn't get better when I got out, I threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation, and resumed weekly attempts. Otherwise I'd just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2017 and 2018 sucked. Last year got a little better and by the end of the year I decided to go back to school. I decided rather abruptly and didn't have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities, which I think I obviously have. I have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but I've assumed I wouldn't receive any accommodations for those because.. what can be done?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nInstead I've tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person, but I'm not adjusting as quickly as I'd hoped. And in the real world, I will have to talk, I will have to have social skills. No one cares about you in the real world. I'm old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields I've attempted, so I'm aware. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI just feel like I'm a failure. And now I'm overloading myself and I dont want to back down, but idk how to deal with everything and get no help, and have nothing outside of school and working at home. I need a good balance, but I have literally no way of making that happen. I'm in a club that meets once a week, the paper which is 1x a month, and now a new club that no one showed up for, so I became club leader. This will force me into social situations, and I hope that I can do it. In my head I'm telling myself to just do it, so I try, and I talk, and garbage comes out. And I'm older than everyone else, so it's awkward. I'm not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI feel like I'm just not going to make it. I have straight A's but I feel like I don't deserve them. My art never looks good to me even after spending hours working. I need to make this work but I dont know how. I dont know how to change who I've been for 29 years, in an instant, but I desperately want to. I want to be different, I dont want to be who I am anymore. In the meantime, I'm trying to squeeze in time with my SO and getting very little sleep. Most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and I feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now, as well as anything fun. I used to walk every day- it's something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and I dont even have time for that. The weather has been shit anyway. I dont find gaming fun, I don't like to sit, but that's all I'm doing. I'm exhausted. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI dont even know what I'm getting at anymore with this. I'm just frustrated with life. Everything is dull,I'm over stressed,lonely, and I honestly just hate myself. Everything about myself is awful, I really hate who I am. I became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 3-4 weeks. It's getting better but I feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since I had no energy. I dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize. I feel like I should just kill myself but I dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful. I'm looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be, well, ideal. I really wish assisted suicide for chronically suicidal people was a thing sometimes.", "I want to pass something along that might save someone.

It doesn't make me feel any better but actually more determined to take my life knowing people live the rest of their life like this. \n\nI'm 16 years old I left school at 15 quit college at 16 and have no qualifications to rely on. I'm extremely socially awkward and possibly have deppresion I don't know. See the thing is I also have a extreme fear of doctors and just having people examine me in general and this has been taking more of an effect on me than normal.\n\nAround December last year I took acid for the first time. I don't remember a lot about that night as I entered an incredibly deep bad trip after my friend was kicked out of the house leaving me alone  on my first time. As I said I can't remember a lot about that night but  2 main factors stuck with me 1. My balls felt HEAVY real heavy 2. I thought I killed myself on multiple occasions that night. I kept seeing images of a weapon infront of me each time different each time more deadly. Everyone time believing they were real I tried to use them to end my life. And it felt like I would wake up everytime alive and I would cry. \n\nReading back on this probably should have mentioned before I was already suicidal as shit before taking oh well.\n\nAnyway couple months progress I'm doing ok and I'm lying in bed smoking a joint when that sane feeling of heaviness occurred in my balls not as strong this time but still there. After a couple weeks of consistent around night time feelings of heaviness occurred I decided to Google (yeah ik) my issue.\n\nTo my absolute fucking horror I discovered I have something called a vardicole or something like that I don't want to go back and check as I'm extremely 0aranoid of reading something I don't want to.\n\nNow before anything gets typed I want to say that it is 100 percent that condition (whatever the name may be) as the symptoms aren't exactly common among other conditions. \n\nAs I said in extremely scared of hospitals and getting examined so something around that area has an extreme effect on me even thinking about getting it checked.\n\nI've been doing good for a while now but I can't get the thoughts out of my head and I can feel myself spiralling until those final moments where I can find eternal peace. \n\nSo this is what I ask of you reading this if you would help me. I'm terrified of searching what will happen to me if I don't get surgery but I also kind of want to know so I'm basing this heavily on trust if you were to do a tiny bit of research on the condition and only leave a positive comment ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT CONDITION PLEASE. Like if it will damage me do not tell me even if it can kill please don't tell me. But if you find anything that will be reassuring please let me know. Because I'm not getting surgery so please please don't tell me anything bad about it I am genuinely terrified to post this in case people just say shit anyway \n\nAlso to find condition type into Google wierd feeling in testicle or something like that I'm not sure I'm sorry I know it's is a lot but if you could take time out of your night to help me it would mean more than you know.", "Laying down on the bathroom floor about to make a cocktail of cleaning, I've given up. emptypost", "it was fun while it lasted tragic how we can just fall apart, we\u2019ll see if i can make it through tomorrow. i\u2019m trying i think", "just if you have anything you think would help, please send it If you have something you think will help me, please say it", "Schools driving me insane I can\u2019t do this anymore, after moving to 3 different high schools in my last year of school, two core classes of mine are failing grades (one 20 and one 55) and I don\u2019t know what to do.

This echoing nothing that carries on from day to day, the overwhelming sadness, the worthlessness... its all too much.   I think about my family and then I feel guilt.. who would find me , who would clean up? Who would pack my shit away or sell it? The damage it would do to my mother only adds to the guilt.  But there\u2019s no way I can stay, living like this hurts. I\u2019m head over heels for someone and every minute I spend with them is lovely. I makes things a little bit easier.

So I told a friend and she was sad, but I reassured her I wasnt going to do anything. When I went home to my apartment, I took a handful of ibuprofen pills and went to sleep. I probably should have taken more because I'm awake typing this. I know it's stupid to think I could overdose on ibuprofen, but I didn't have anything else.

Him telling me to get over it. The reason I want to die isn't because of him. However, knowing that whatever feelings I felt of love were unrequited, just makes me wish I wasn't alive to see it.

I don't know who to talk to and don't really have anyone to talk to so I just want to dump everything here and maybe get some guidance before I do something to make the pain go away. I never see my parents due to my mom and step dad being too busy with work and running a business and my dad is probably somewhere rotting in Arizona. My sister is deployed in the navy and the other ran away a few years ago and haven't heard from her, and my older brother is a drug addict that cut ties with us a long time ago. \n\nI don't want to message a suicide hotline out of fear they will send an ambulance or force me into a hospital forcing bills on me that I can not afford, and I have no one close to talk to about it. My situation is, growing up my parents both lived in different bad areas with little money. I was never smart or talented at anything besides having an over active imagination. I always had a learning issue both with paying attention and remembering information regardless of how hard I tried. Didn't have a lot of friends and ended up dropping out of high school. About 3 years ago I went back and got my Adult Diploma with the hopes it would be enough to get me on my feet. I'm now almost 26 and just a few months ago after I saw someone about my mental health I found out I have ADD. So some things where answered there, but it didn't help much. \n\nThe small amount of friends that I have, have become aware of my increasing depressed emotions and have tried to help but for the most part, they seem to pay no mind to it. I've working dead end jobs for most of my adult life until recently when I took a boot camp course in the Information Technology field. I then interned for 5 weeks and after got a position working for a small company as an IT help desk technician under a 3 month to perm contract. Or that's what they told me during the interview. I never did anything IT related and the contract was constantly extend by 3 months until my 9th month there. In that time, I've worked for some bad companies, but I have never worked somewhere that treated there (specifically the US employees) so poorly. They then after promising to increase my pay hired me on full time as salary, and cut my pay thinking I wouldn't notice. I then secretly started looking for new positions starting last July until November of last year when I was tired of they way they have treated me for over a year and without thinking, just left, even though I have monthly bills. \n\nOn top of the learning problems, I also have extreme anger problems and am very VERY impatient. As far as work goes, I have applied to countless IT positions since last July, with professional help updating resumes and cover letters, and re learning (trying to) as much IT knowledge as I can after using pretty much none of it at my last job and forgetting almost all of it, but I've gotten nothing. I have had 2 companies interview me and reject me after the 2nd or 3rd interview, and all of the other countless companies I've applied to have either flat out rejected me or have not said anything. I have next to nothing left with money and if I don't find something soon, I will lose everything and I can only imagine how bad my credit will be and the law suits to follow. Other than job things, I have never been in a real relationship, I never see my family even though I literally live with my mom and step dad, I almost never see my friends, I have an extreme hate for people I'm assuming due to everything I've had to go through over the years, and every day I spend hours trying to teach myself new things and applying for any position available that could possible help me with my situation, but since the last interview rejection and the constant no reply and email rejections, I can't anymore. \n\nI've tried so hard to make things better for myself, seeking medical help, close support from family and friends, and will power, but it's always one step forward and then being launched back. I'm tired of starting over, I'm tired of only knowing rejection and being ignored not just from jobs but from everything. I have become so angry and hate filled that I can't see happiness in anything. I used to love movies and video games and can't find joy in those. The only piece of escape I have day to day is music, because it almost thinks for me. I'm listening to it but I feel like it's also listening to me, feeling my constant pain and emotional wreck. Everyone says it will get better, but I've been at this for so long and it only keeps getting worse. I have put the effort in but it's like some deity is purposefully trying to prevent me from being happy or making myself successful, and over the past few weeks, I can't stop thinking of killing myself. Making this awful pain go away and not feeling anything anymore. The only thing that holds me back is the thought of what comes after. Possible non existence which I can't even comprehend. Just not knowing is the only thing holding me back, but even that fear is starting to go away and taking an early exit seems more and more like the best option.\n\nI apologize for the extremely long post, maybe just a way to leave a small mark on existence to make myself feel a little better. I don't seem myself feeling any better even if my hard work eventually gets me anywhere, a family, a job that actually pays enough for me to live on my own, not constantly worrying if I have enough for food and water or if I have to cut that out to make my payments. It's hard to feel happy or accomplished when all you know is failure and loss. There is more but I feel like I've said enough if anyone even reads this. I've re read this and gone over it a few times and I just keep feeling worse and adding more to it.

Anyways, what I'm getting at is I feel I've put a lot of bad energy out there and it's all culminating into one big disaster over the past few months. That disaster being the realization that the skills that I say I have on paper I don't actually have in real life (somehow miraculously I got by the past 10 years) and now I don't know what to do. Over the past few months I haven't been sleeping, barely getting anything done at work and overall feel like the end is near.

I saw myself sharing a future with her. I might have committed too much in the relationship, because it was something I always relied on. We had this weird phase of not talking much before breaking up. She constantly said she was busy with school work, family and hobbies. I believed her. She is a very work active person. One day, about few weeks ago she called me and said she thinks she is gay. I was heartbroken obviously. I still am. She has been seeing this girl a lot too.

It is hard for me to admit, because I enjoy being alone, but it does make sense that I am seriously lonely.

My online friends cant even play video games with me, which would mean a lot if I could for once just do something fun with other people.\n\nI am currently seeing a therapist. She has seen me at my worst. I never told her I was suicidal, but I'm sure she might know that already. My only solutions I can think of to get out of this hell is medication and waiting for some kind of a miracle to happen. If that doesn't work I really cannot see myself making it to my 20s or 30s. It sucks because I do want to live, but living with depression, loneliness, anxiety, heartbreak and all that kind of bs doesn't sounds worth it to me.

I don't trust anyone to talk about this with, they respond with ways that make me hide my what I truly feel.\n\nI want this pain to stop, the pain I've been feeling for years. Why am I broken? Besides not waking up, I don't know what else is the answer. I understand why my family member committed suicide, I get it, it isn't selfish, it is to stop the pain that many can't understand.\n\nI don't know what to do.

No one listens. No one understands my fears, my pain. I am tired of begging the ones close to me to understand me. It more than often seems that I am just a burden that they are carrying, and until everything is right with me, they are right, when something goes wrong with me and I need their help, they take up arms against me. I am very tired of all this. I am tired of this life. I don't want to live any more. There is absolutely no joy in my life, just pretence.

Have I given someone this much pain in life? Maybe I have. And maybe it is all coming back to me. So I beg you, whoever you are that makes all things go.. give it all to me once. Give all of whatever pain you have kept for me, all at once. And release me from this shell. I do not want it any more. I have no use for such an existence.

I\u2019ve been debating posting on here for a while but I\u2019m having more suicidal thoughts than ever before and I just need to get this all of my chest. I\u2019m 32, male. I have an amazing girlfriend who is way out of my league and a fun job I enjoy and yet, here I am. \n\nDespite having some really good parts of my life, I\u2019m slammed by thoughts of being worthless and just living a pointless existence. I\u2019m in debt up to my eyeballs and my credit is trashed. I feel like despite getting a $15,000 raise at work, I\u2019m still nowhere near where I want to be at this point in my life. I feel like I have no tangible future and am just waiting to die one day. In the past 4 years I\u2019ve lost my father and my grandmother, two of the most influential people in my life. I\u2019m in the process of moving but am having a difficult time finding good apartments because of my credit so Ive been forced to stay with my mom until I\u2019m settled. I travel for my job and my car is falling apart but I don\u2019t have good replacement options again because of the credit issue. I\u2019m ridden with anxiety about everything and fear of future issues prevents me from enjoying the now. To top it all off, I was visiting my girlfriend this weekend who lives a few hours away from me and I severely inured my knee and I can\u2019t walk. I have to find a surgeon and probably have an operation and she wants to take care of me hand and foot but it just makes me feel like I\u2019m a giant burden. She\u2019s so amazing and I feel like I don\u2019t offer anything financially and am just a 32 dependent who, as of right now can barely make it to the bathroom because of this damn leg. \n\nI am an atheist. I don\u2019t believe in any form of an afterlife as I just can\u2019t accept something with no evidence. I firmly believe in my heart that my grandmother and father are gone. Aside from their graves nothing remains of them and they are not in another realm enjoying themselves. All that exists for then is the black void of nothingness. And despite so many rays of sunshine in my dark life, I feel so envious of them. To not have to feel this anxiety and pain anymore is such an appealing feeling to me. This world is such a terrible place where ignorance and hate have run so rampant and people take such joy in hurting their fellow man. What future can society have with a foundation like this? I find myself thinking about ending everything on a near daily basis. I see lots of redditors posting here about how they are excited for some kind of afterlife because they can\u2019t accept that this is the best we can do. But for me, an absence of anything would be as good as the existence of a heaven. \n\nI feel better having laid all this out in text but I still find myself objectively weighing the pros and cons of ending my life.

whats her past medical history? and maybe about 40 other questions.  even calling my cat a train wreck. she was in horrible condition and he kept telling me things such as \"well if you wouldve taken her to your regular vet and had checkups sooner, all of this couldve been prevented\" \"you should've given her her medicine. hyperthyroidism is manageable and bc you didnt do this and that your cat is in the condition that shes in\"   which just made me feel so damn guilty. i wanted to take her away right then and there. he then tells me that he couldnt feel her liver and that she only had 25% of her kidneys working and that she was extremely dehydrated.\n\nhe mentioned giving her medicine and iv drips and changing her diet but because of the state she was in, he said it wouldn't do much at all at this point because her kidneys would eventually fail. so then he suggests euthanasia. and my heart dropped like a rock. i didnt want to do it. i wanted to give her the medicine i was hell bent on it. ill pay it now, i dont care what the price is ill pay it now! but he kept pushing me and my sister to sign up for a credit plan to pay for it because he simply \"didnt want to be the bank\" he even said that we could give her all of the medicine and change her diet etc and theres a possibility that it still wont work at all because of how debilitated she was. \n\neventually our family made the decision to have her put to sleep on the same day as the visit. we had a previous cat who passed away due to kidney failure and we didnt want her to go through the same thing. we all snuggled her, kissed her and pet her until she breathed her final breath on the table. it was heart wrenching. we didnt want to bring her home because we all live with out 80 year old grandmother who prior to having her put to sleep, my grandmother would see her dragging her legs and see how weak and exhausted she looked and would start crying and saying how she didnt want to see the cat suffer like that anymore.  we didnt want to bring her home because we didnt want anything to happen to grandma so  we had everything done in one day and it all happened so fast. im still torn about it. i feel like i can go back in time and pull her away from the table, and bring her to present day. \n\ni miss you so much misty,  my little baby. it felt like we all yanked you out of this world too soon and thats what drives me crazy. the regular vet i tookher to long ago when we first found out about it told us all that she had hyperthyroidism. all 3 of us were in charge of making sure she got her medicine until she finished it, and then it dwindled down to just me having the responsibility. i was in a very stressed out mindset between my shit job with no set hours,  and  taking care of my grandmother who has dementia.we have to make sure she dosent wander outside or anything. and had completely forgotten/ was counting on other family members to give her her medicine because i was not home. i had forgotten that she even took  medicine at all because she was doing so well. she was eating, and playing until about last year when i went to have her ears checked. thats when they reminded me. and it all went downhill. \n\nso again i gave her her medicine and she  finished it. only to find out this year she would have to be put to sleep. i never intended to hurt you misty, i never wanted you to get so sick. every morning i cry my eyes out wishing you were here with me on my bed or licking my hand or even meowing that cute little \"hello\" meow you used to do. every day i think about the what ifs and the if onlys. i cant even smell or look at certain things anymore, i cant smile or be happy anymore without my baby. \ni bought a box cutter last week because i was seriously contemplating ending my own life because of the horrible guilt. i feel like i murdered that cat. i feel like i purposefully let her get sick and die . i felt like she didnt need to be euthanized. it was my responsibility to make sure you got your medicine and i fucked up so bad. i dont want to live anymore feeling like this. im so sorry my sweet baby kitty.   how can i help my grandmother if i failed to help you?

M/16, currently going through depression and can't talk to anyone. I've been visiting a psychotherapist for about 2 years and a psychiatrist for several weeks but just decided to stop going there like 6 months ago. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety and have depression but never actually talked about that with anyone, not even with my parents or the therapists. My everyday life goes like this: wake up, survive 7 hours at school, come home, play video games for rest of the day since I don't have anything better to do, cry into sleep, repeat. In school I barely speak to anyone even though I am going in the same class for over 5 years now. Only have 1-2 friends but they mostly only see me as the last choice everytime and only want to meet up when no one else has time. Recently we got someone new in the class and it seems like he had more social contact with the everyone else in the past 3 days than me in the last 5 years. Everyone think's i am introverted and it's kinda true, but only because I get rejected by everyone I even try to talk to and get excluded from everything. When people throw parties, I never get invited but people they barely talk to get invited. My grades are horrible and I am about to get off the school and don't even know what I want to become, since i just stopped caring after I noticed that everyone ignores me and no matter how hard I try to build up a new friendship / contact, I get rejected. I am the kind of person to look at my phone and than ask someone what time it is just so I have somewhat of a social interaction lmao. My parents only see my grades but don't care about my feelings. Because of this happening over many years (basically my whole life) I began to hide behind a emotionless mask. I am not able to express my feelings. nothing. The only thing i can do is laugh (because of something funny, not because i am actually happy) or hate on something. Even if anyone would make me happy, e.g. inviting me to a party, I couldn't show it and still act bored / emotionless because I am too afraid what people would think when I suddenly change and behave like everyone else. I also don't know anymore how to feel empathy. Like i would really like to and empathize with someone but no matter how hard I try it just doesn't work. When someone is sad I can say to myself \"this person is sad\" and feel bad about it, but I cannot comprehend it. I also feel absolutely worthless. For example I don't even say hi/goodbye to most people since i think i am not worth their time. When I meet someone from school outside accidentally, I walk pass them and they walk past me just because I don't want the other person to feel awkward. I know they don't like me and their day is probably ruined just by seeing me so i don't try to force the contact. At this point in my life i noticed that people are just assholes not caring about anyone. Everyone has their perfect life and ignores me so trying further wouldn't change anything. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. In the past i began to think more often about how it would be if just killed myself. I am not really thinking about doing it, but honestly I couldn't care less if I just got hit by a but. I feel like visiting the psychiatrist / therapist wouldn't change anything since I am not being honest to them anyways and don't know how I could be. Anyone good experiences with psychiatrist?

I\u2019m scared", "Life is unbearable. I'm losing my mind. I wish I had the courage to end this shit. Praying that someone out there reads this. I've been realizing some damn hard truths about myself. I've never been happy, ever since I was a little kid I felt like I was \"bad\". You know how children play \"house\" and it can be used in therapy to evaluate their outlook and issues? When I was a kid, I would play \"house\" with my fingers: there was the mom, dad, brother, and sister (me, the pinky finger). Each time, everyone would gang up on and beat up the sister. I just remembered that I used to \"play\" that game the other day - I don't think I have any real excuse for that, I was anxious as hell from a young age and irritable as fuck, but what kind of kid thinks of that shit? I was messed up back then.\n\n\nI've talked to professionals. They seem to think that this is more than anxiety and depression. They say that I've faced a lot of trauma in my life. I suppose it makes sense. My parents were heavily abused during their childhoods, my mom even tried to kill herself as a young kid. My dad was an abusive alcoholic for most of my childhood. He and my mom would fight a lot - they would swear at each other, he would hit and throw things at her, she would scream at him and they would usually tell each other to go to Hell or drop dead. My dad was verbally abusive, and I remember he would hit my brother too. I presume he hit me, but I don't remember. All I remember is that when I was a teenager, he got so angry at me that he held me down on the couch. I was so detached, all I thought was how he was so angry he was about to drool on me, and how it was gross. I love my parents, despite their flaws. I just don't like them. We fight all the time. When I was younger, I remember that often when I got into a row with one parent, the other would get involved and then they would fight with each other. They would say horrible things like what I said above. They would say awful things to me too, like how once I was mad and my mom said I should look in the mirror to see how ugly I look. She would tell me to \"get out of her sight\" a lot. I get called a bitch at times. I'm told I treat them horrible, and I hate myself even more when they say that. Ugh. On the note of trauma, I realized earlier this year that I was repeatedly raped (oral, not vaginal) by my ex over the course of a year or so. That's also been tough to process.\n\nIt's fucked because I know my parents love me. They read to me as a child, they taught me to be independent. They just want me to be happy. But there's just always been something missing, I guess.\n\nI realized that I may be in a chronic state of mild dissociation. I often feel detached from my body, my emotions, my environment, other people. I feel like I'm in a fog. My limbs aren't quite attached to my body, I feel floaty or dizzy. Weak and shaky. At times I dissociate harder, and I go totally numb. Can't move. Can't talk. Things look smaller, I float above or behind my body. My vision gets weird. It's scary yet comfortable because I'm aware that I'm further detached from myself and in a limbo for an hour. It fades and I get a headache, my body hurts, and I'm exhausted. Then it's back to reality, and I feel even more off for the rest of the day. I've noticed I also mildly dissociate when I try to sleep. My head is disconnected from my body, my limbs feel large or disconnect from my body. It's incredibly disturbing and I don't know why it happens. I never even realized I apparently dissociate until I started thinking about my childhood. Experienced some crazy depersonalization and derealization. When it happened, I realized that it was *very* familiar and I remembered doing it a lot as a kid. That realization fucked me up.\n\n\nWhat really makes me feel crazy is the apparent somatic symptoms. I developed chronic visual snow and headaches as a teenager. I also started getting ocular migraines. Numerous tests and exams showed that all is well - it's just stress. My mouth has been hurting for the past year, as well. I even got an extra wisdom tooth removed, thinking that was the source of the pain. Nope. The pain persists, and is very noticeable when I'm stressed. Xrays and exams show that things are fine. I feel like a damn hypochondriac or like I'm malingering...but this is all very real to me.\n\n\nI feel weak a lot. I am also dizzy, or like my brain is rotting, or stuffed with cotton/fog. My head is never \"clear\". I can't focus on much. Working is difficult. I can't truly interact with friends or family anymore. My weight has been all over. Due to horrible anxiety, I had lost a third of my body weight in 9 months. When I fell into this double depression, I lost 14 pounds in 2 weeks. Then someone I care about confronted me about the seriousness of it all. I tried to maintain my weight, and it worked for a month. Then I had a little breakdown and lost 7 pounds in 5 days. Started an antidepressant and became apathetic as hell - had an aborted suicide attempt and binge ate like crazy even though I wasn't hungry. I was like \"fuck it I deserve to gain weight and look disgusting\". I've gained 10 pounds in a week. I hate myself so much.\n\n\nThe more I realize, the more I hate myself. I've tried six or seven antidepressants, I've tried therapy a few times and am trying again. On another med right now. It all feels so damn hopeless. I've wanted to die since I was 13, and every day is just full of more pain and despair. \n\n\nPeople tell me not to give up on myself, but it gets more and more tempting as time goes on. Ever since I was 15, I always had a strong feeling I would die by suicide. I figured I wouldn't kill myself until I was 27 or 28, but things are becoming more disasterous. I just wish I had the courage to end this suffering soon. I feel like such a disgusting coward and a fraud. I'm ashamed to exist, to take up space in this world.", "Going through a bad episode. Holding on by a thread. One little thing could push me over the edge. My bedroom and bathroom look like a hurricane struck them and I can\u2019t even eat normally, if at all. I can barely move. That\u2019s not an exaggeration, just doing simple tasks feels like agony. I haven\u2019t self-harmed in almost a year, yet I feel like relapsing. I just want to give myself alcohol poisoning or jump off of a bridge over an interstate. I feel like a burden on my fianc\u00e9.

Many things I could add to the list like I\u2019m mid 20s I only have a part time job and I don\u2019t feel motivated or want to look for a career because I just don\u2019t feel I\u2019m good enough anymore. Feels as though I\u2019m really done with life and that my times is up and I don\u2019t really know what to do anymore. I\u2019m just sad and existing in a world that I don\u2019t want to be apart of anymore and I\u2019m typing this really because I don\u2019t know who else to talk to about it anymore. I just want to crawl in a ball and cry every day and I wake up and go to sleep thinking I want to be dead. I just wish I could be happy again and be myself but it just doesn\u2019t feel an option anymore..", "A story to hopefully bring you back from the brink of suicide... Hi there, I don\u2019t know if this will help you at all, but if it helps even one person, that\u2019s enough for me. A bit of back ground information, I am a 22 year old that has been suffering from severe depression for the past year, with suicidal thoughts everyday of every hour. I felt like I was already dead cause no one seemed to notice me and I was slowly wasting away from the inside out. I also began to hear voices that would constantly berate me and tell me to kill myself, and after this, I sought help from my GP and was put onto anti-depressants (Sertraline) which did absolutely nothing. They didn\u2019t make it worse, but they certainly didn\u2019t make it better.\n\nI was then put onto another anti-depressant (Mirtazapine) which I started taking at the beginning of February 2020, which seemed to help. I had the energy to finally get out of bed, take a shower and leave the house. But a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that although I had the energy to get up and go about my daily life, I was still thinking about killing myself everyday, but this time it was different as I had the energy and motivation to actually come up with a detailed plan and go through with it; and this scared me so much as I have never felt an urge to kill myself as much as I have in the last couple of weeks. \n\nSo yesterday, I had a lot to deal with. My partner has been very sick with an unknown illness for nearly a year, so his parents rushed him to hospital. I was an absolute mess as I have been really struggling to \nsilence the suicidal thoughts, whilst also fulfilling my duty as a carer for my partner. I had a mental breakdown after they took him to the hospital as the voices wouldn\u2019t stop. I actually began shouting back at them, but after a few minutes sobbing on the bathroom floor, I became completely numb and decided to follow through with my plan. \n\nI grabbed my supplies, which involved a dog lead, but I had made sure to buy this one especially for this occasion as it perfectly fit around my neck and had a sturdy metal clip which I could attach to the banister which would hold my weight. I was ready to do it, I was ready to go, and I put the collar around my neck and began to push my neck down into the collar to cut off the blood supply to the main artery in my neck, I heard this would only take a minute or so to make me unconscious, and the whole time I was holding my dog close to my chest cause I was so scared, but I wanted to die so badly. As I could feel myself going, I stopped. And I don\u2019t know what stopped me, but part of me thought that it wasn\u2019t my time to go. So I ended up picking up the phone and calling someone, who managed to calm me down and helped me look at everything from a different perspective. \n\nI know a lot of people will say that it\u2019s selfish for feeling suicidal or committing suicide due to the hurt it would cause to family/friends etc but from what I felt yesterday, none of that mattered. I truly believed that I wanted to die, and if I hadn\u2019t have stopped myself when I had, I would probably be dead now. \n\nBut this morning, my partner finally got an official diagnosis of what has been making him so ill. I am currently sat in the hospital waiting for him to come out of surgery, and I have been told by the doctors that he is going to live a very healthy, normal life after this operation. If I had have killed myself yesterday afternoon, I would never have gotten to find out that my partner was going to be okay. I would never get to marry him in April. I would never get to see him healthy and happy again. All of these things I would have never known if I was dead now. I can now look forward to being able to spend time with my partner who can now start to enjoy his life again, and I can try and enjoy mine as much as I can knowing that he will be around for a long time. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get at after my long ass story, is that if there is any sort of hope you can cling onto, whether thats a friend, a pet, something you\u2019ve got planned in the near future, or even just the feeling of the sun on your skin. Anything to get you through each day. You never have know when your life could take a turn for the best, or if something amazing will happen; and all of these things you will never get to experience if you end it all now. I\u2019m not here to say that you shouldn\u2019t do it, because at the end of the day, I\u2019m just some stranger on the internet that you don\u2019t know. But what I do know is that things can always get better. Always. But you never know when; and you\u2019ll never know if you\u2019re not here.", "I keep fantasizing about commiting suicide and executing it.... ...but never actually have enough energy or courage to do it.\nAt least not yet.", "I'm gonna slit my wrists \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21 Fuck you assholes \ud83e\udd21\ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95", "I dont want to die.

At 13, 16, 19 everyone says it'll get better. I'm 23 and nothing's gotten any better.\n\nI had a 3 year relationship and she threw me to the curb. I had a 2 year relationship following (after a break from  the 1st, we only dated a year but were close/fuck buddies for a year leading to it) and we broke up tonight, fun fact we still live together until july. My depression doesn't stem from relationships, there's a plethora of things contributing to it. I think I'm out of my depth on this one. We were fuck buddies because I didn't want another relationship. I didn't want to give someone a chance to hurt me again. \n\nShe was moving for school and I couldn't bare the thought of losing her so I asked her to date and we planned and did move in together.\nI've punched myself in the face because it's less damaging then cutting myself. I think at this point if I self harm it'll be the end. I promised myself that long ago though I didn't follow through the last time I started cutting myself. This time I think I would, one  pump of adrenaline is all it would take then I wouldn't be hurt anymore. \n\nI left all my friends for her, I moved an hour away for her. I dont see a point in living, I dont see a point in eating or sleeping. \n\nI dont know what I'm expecting fro. This honestly, I have noone but my sister and I hate being a burden on her (though tonight she may have kept me here). I know how I'd do it, it would be a 10 minute trip to get what I need. I dont want to but I have nothing and noone. No friends, out.of my family only my nana and sister talk to me. I've texted my dad yesterday and today about a car issue and that's the most we've talked in 2 days than I can remember. Usually it's around 1 a month, sometimes more sometimes less.\n\nI'm a burden on everyone. I think the world would be a better place. All I can think about is putting a knife against my throat and givin' er. \n\nRelationships didn't cause this, certainly attributed. No friends, no family, noone to hurt if I die. I dont know what I was hoping to accomplish with this post but I think its pushed me farther towards doing it.\n\nI hope you have a good day, thanks for taking a few minutes to read my messy/suicidal thoughts.\n\nTldr: have a good day.", "I \"should\" be fine, but I'm not Make enough money.

However in middle school, I've experienced trauma that changed me forever and left a very deep scar on me emotionally that took me years to overcome because no one tried to help, those who see me went through it and those who I spoke to about it didn't try to help. For years I had trust issues and was paranoid most of the time, it was my first experience of feeling alone and that no one understands me, and slowly I started to drift away and shut myself out, I just wanted to be alone and because of that I started to lose friends but I didn't care at that time, I thought I was doing the right thing by avoiding as much social interaction as possible. I guess in a way I was trying to protect myself.\n\nThe years after that, I've tried to regain my social life back and make friends again, I tried everything that I can from trying to act as a happy and funny person cause no one wants to see the real me, my depressing and sad self who wants to make friends with such a person? and when it actually works out, I thought I was doing the right thing but it ends up making me more depressed cause it takes me a lot of effort to be \"that person\" and I really didn't felt like I'm making any deep connection with anyone so I was like screw it, I'll just be myself by which I mean that I will not try anything to be forcefully liked by others and I thought since I'm into so many things, I will probably find someone who is into one of these things and be friends with but that didn't work out either. I kinda became that extra friend in a group that her existence or not didn't make any difference or that friend who you come to when your other friends are not around or that person you hang out not because you enjoy their company but you just don't want to be sitting alone. That messed me up in my senior year of high school, I felt like shit and I spent most of the time during the break in the toilet cause I rather that than feeling like shit when I am with others. And just to be clear, they are not awful people and they didn't say anything bad to me, it's just I've been friends with them for so long and whether at that time when I was trying to be the funny and happy person or myself, either way, I never felt I belong or that anyone cared, I felt I was just someone they knew and sure why not they can call a \"friend\".\n\nIn college though is where my struggle peaked, all those friendships that I made in high school are slowly disappearing everyone was moving on with their lives and I guess that means leaving unwanted relationships behind but regardless I did what I thought was right and did my part. I've reached out to them but it always ends up a one-sided relationship with everyone apparently and no one will reach out to me if I don't so I stopped. There was this one person I was close to during my school years and I tried to be the friend she can rely on in time of needs and depend on, I wanted to be always there for her but she never makes time for me but somehow she can with others so I tried to put \"our friendship\" to the test and just respond coldly to her messages just to see if she will ask what's wrong, I want her to notice that there was a problem and see if she gonna care about our friendship but she ends up unfollowing me in social media and blocked me out of her life that simply even though she perfectly knows me too well and knows that this is not my kind of behavior.\n\nI had no problem talking with strangers, I can open a conversation and interact with anyone easily so trying to get to know people in college was not difficult except I don't think anyone wanted to be my friend, I just remain their classmate. I end up making just one friend in college, we had a lot in common and I really believed it could work out but it took a lot of ignoring of her frustrating attitude which sometimes makes me wonder if she will bother to hold on to me if I ever show my frustration. At some point, I've gone through a deep depression that made me very suicidal and thought there was no future for me but I was trying to hold on to hope and as much I want to act tough and act like I can handle this I couldn't, I really just need someone to talk to and so far as you can see I had no one except this college friend and I didn't know how it will go but thought let's give it a try so I opened up to her and after when I was done, the conversation didn't last for 2 minutes and I was so crushed because sure maybe she was not the perfect person to open up to but at that time I didn't have any option and I just really needed someone in my life to talk to. I really thought I'm gonna do it on that day cause I really lost hope.\n\nAs of now, it feels like I'm back at the starting point. I probably sound very awfully pathetic person or stupid to you. Every time when I'm not able to maintain any relationship in my life, I asked myself what's wrong with me? what have I done wrong in my life? I realized after a while that I try to fix things so hard in my life that I end up breaking it or damaging it but I always thought I was doing the right thing and doing my part by reaching out or helping out but somehow it doesn't make things better. It always seems that I'm the one making the effort and if you didn't notice, throughout those stages of my life that I mentioned no one tried to be my friend or wanted to but I've always seemed to be the one who wants to be someone's friend. Right now, I'm very much confused about what exactly I'm supposed to do. I just don't understand why I'm struggling so much to find somewhere I belong, I feel very much rejected no matter what I do. If I make an effort or not I end up alone either way. Everyone in my life seems to give up on me and no one bothers to hold on to me. I just don't know if I'm supposed to give up and just accept the fact that maybe this is how things supposed to be in my life.\n\nI tried not to bore you guys with the details and complicate stuff, I hope my situation was made clear and it wasn't confusing. I just really need some advice cause I don't think I'm going to find a good one from my mind. One again, thank you for taking the time to read my post!", "Is suicide worth it? Hi, I'm 15 years old. Currently been pulled out of school,due to many reasons, which is why I'm here so that I can clear my mind of any other thoughts that may lead me to things that I might regret later on. I'd like to share first my story so that no one would come at me.(ex. You're just 15, its just a phase. Pls stop doing this to get attention.etc) when I was very young I didn't really paid any attention whenever my father and mother would fought or when my sister( the 2nd oldest) would always ignore or would get pissed at me, because I thought that it was the norm. But things got worse when the whole family fought because of the sh*tty things my father had done and it all started because of me drinking a godd*mn cola, it went like this: \"who drank the cola?\" My father asked I was very scared so I didn't replied he asked that again and again until my mother told my father off, until they just started to shout at each other which forced my eldest sister to butt in, and the whole thing went to what my father did, such as adultery and abuse. So it lead to my father pushing my mother, which pushed my sisters to fight my father, physically. I couldn't do anything but it really shocked me, and blamed myself for it. After the whole ordeal, it took 5 months to mend back the family. I thought finally, but I still had other problemsto face. I know that its stereotypical of me to say this but my asian parents(filipino) would always forced me to study when I never wanted any of this, I just wanted to play with other kids with no care in the world but I couldn't. My mothers way of teaching really left a toll on me cuz she would just hit me whenever I get the wrong answer or if I couldn't reply with the correct answer. I've always been the 2nd honor roll, but when she said this to me on the way back home \"pls don't drop your grades it would be really embarassing to my friends if you did\" that was jusy painful for me. others may think that I'm overreacting it was still really painful, tho I still couldn't speak my mind, I continued still, I was getting bullied as well for no reason. Years went by I was already in my first year of highschool in a prestige academy. I made friends, been respected, and I had little bumps in my grades but I still felt really great. Then one day one of my friends who is a guy told me to hang out with him, I couldn't tell that he had malicious intents. I was just really stupid. He cornered me \"can i touch your boobs?\" He said, I was shocked and refused but he was really strong and managed to touched me and resorted to attempted rape, afte I broke free, crying and running in the same day. I couldn't tell anyone nor my parent. So I just cried the whole night and proceeded to go to school and bearing to be with him in the same class. I had finally mustered up the courage to tell the guidance councelor, and due to that he got expelled and words got out because of the things he did and so I got harassed even more with the guys but I couldn't do anything and told myself to bear with it. I now entered my 2nd year of highschool which started the changes with me I became more irritated, a hot mess. I've been disrespectful to my mom, the reason we fight every morning. And another problem rosed up. A mistress of my father contacted me, I knew that she was just messing with me but I felt so angry. So I told my guidance counselor because I didn't know what to do anymore, so she told my mom and filed a case to my dads mistress, but the case got dropped because they said the account iwas fake when clearly it wasn't, I know I'm no professional but it was pretty obvious that it wasn't fake. I got even more mad because my mom didn't mind and told me it must be  Gods plan (I'm christian but I'm not really on how my mother believes)now things really went downhill for me.I couldn't eat, I couldn't think of happy thoughts, I  would just think of nothing, or everything is just useless even humanity, and that I wished I could just sleep and die from it. Things got even worse because my sister(the 2nd eldest), whenever I tell her shes wrong she would get mad at me,whenever I got mad at her she would get made at me, even tho she was in the wrong, but she was too prideful and wouldn't say sorry but I still did anyway. When things got even more hectic I started to hurt myself, my mom knew and told me angrily that I did it because of the internet. I couldn't take it anymore everything that I do is wrong,  its like I'm the misfortune. I wanted to kill myself, which is why I went to the guidance counselor, and told my mom everything, so she pulled me out of school, and appointed me to a psychiatrist but the medicines was too much for me, in short it was painful, and it makes me go insane for some reason, and even messed with my diet(made me eat more). So my mom stopped me from drinking the pills, but the withdrawal was sh*tty too. I still get mad at everything and I really want to kill myself. I mean I don't know I'm still thinking of the pros and cons of me killing myself. Its just that I wish in my sleep someone would kill me.

The prices are equivalent of what my mother made in her old job in 2 years. Life was good until Coronavirus struck. Apparently, healthcare in Europe is downright FRUSTRATING.

I've said some truly awful things. Not just to them. I lost a friend after I verbally abused her, too. And I've treated my best friend horribly.\n\nWorse than that, the animals. Both of the first cats I ever had ran away, so I must have done something to them. The third, I chased her around and sprayed her with water and hit her. For years. She was traumatized. She hated me. She'd always scratch me up and I deserved it. The fifth cat ran away, I don't know what I did. The sixth cat I don't remember if I was mean or nice but I gave her to some old ladies because we had to move. I hope they loved her. My seventh cat is my current cat. I got her right before I turned twelve. I used to put a laundry basket over her and shake it while she screamed. She was just a little kitten. I stopped doing that at some point because my mom talked to me. But I hit her. Sometimes multiple times. This cat isn't traumatized mostly. She cuddles me every fucking night that I let her. But...\n\nThen there's my dogs. I beat the shit out of my older dog, multiple times when I was an older teen. I beat him with shoes because he chewed them. He was just sad I had to go to school and I beat him. My younger dog I beat the shit out of once (maybe, technically, twice? same day in a short time period), ever. 1,264 days ago. I was so gutted about how badly I hurt him-- he was bruised under his fur and upset for days-- I swore never to beat any animal ever again, and I haven't. But I still hit them.

I think about the abuse all the time. It's probably 80% of my thoughts. I am trying to not do these things. To never be verbally or physically abusive again.

I grew up in an emotionally, verbally, and occasionally physically abusive home. My dad became an alcoholic as a result of the abuse from my mom. I became the unwilling referee and parental therapist as a preteen and eventual side punching bag as a teen. My mom has tried to kill me a few times now - some before I was 18, some after, and also kidnapped me as a child after she and my dad had a fight. I spent all of my adolescence waiting for a chance to get out. CPS came twice but nothing ever helped. I got into a dream school and everything as a senior, but that got ripped away too. Mom refused to sign off on loans - which I could not get without a co-signer. There went my escape. \n\nThey divorced. I became the physical punching bag for my mom. I cut my hair off to prevent her from grabbing it. My dad got worse. I tried to kill myself a few times, all of which failed for some reason or another. Got 51/50'd. My mom proceeded to use that as a threat from then on of where she could send me if I didn't behave. I stayed with my dad after that, and cut her off. Still was depressed as fuck though. Only person I could talk to about any of it was my grandma. One night talked to her and my aunt (who's racist and hates me) happened to also be there. She took the phone and screamed at me. Told me never to call my grandma again, told me to stop making up shit about my family and stop talking suicide to an elder. My grandma could handle it, she used to feel that way too - it's why I could talk to her about it. \n\nFast forward a little bit and my dad (just after we finally patched our relationship and things looked better) suddenly died from his drinking problem. I had to go back to my mom because no other relative was an option. My mom immediately took it out on me, and I became terrified to even wake up. She tried to smother me to death, tried to choke me out with an aux cord, tried to shove me down the stairs, tried to push me out of a moving vehicle, etc. Yet every time blamed me. It was the worst year of my life, or so I thought. At least I had my grandma. She was depressed too, over losing her son, and because she was being abused by her daughter (the racist aunt). I was trying to help but it always got covered up somehow. Then exactly one year later, my grandma suddenly died. But she left me half her estate to protect myself, because she wanted me to move out and live near her. She was the only person left that wanted to help me. \n\nBut then my aunt (the one from before) got hissy about the fact that her mom and I were closer than they ever were, and she lawyered up. She refused to give me a key, refused to give me the items my grandma specifically wanted me to have (because no proof), and informed me of the sale well after it happened while I was out of state. She also kept going through my mom, which was idiotic - as my parents divorced and I was an adult. I asked her about it, she dodged, so I wrote a letter. She never contacted me again for months, so I had to get an attorney (that I can't afford tbh) and we've been back and forth on that since. Now she's threatening to file the taxes under my name without my permission without my SSN so the IRS comes after me. All this over fucking recipe cards and a desk!  \n\nI always think about wanting to end it, end the pain, end the inevitable suffering that always comes, but I can't. I can't leave my cats. I refuse to rehome, the word itself hurts me to even type or see. How could I do such a thing to my family? The only ones there for me?

They are literally the closest to me and the only ones that keep me going. I just wish I could do something for them too (like find a new place to live, but I can't). My mom recently made credit cards under my name and maxed them out. Told me this just so \"I'd understand the position I'm in.\" If anyone asks her she says it's just to help me build my credit. To which I'm sure is somewhat true, because she intends to sign my name off as a cosigner to a property she wants to buy. \n\nTo her I've only ever been a means to an end.

I have depression and schizophrenia, but I still brush my hair, brush my teeth, use deodorant, and body spray. I don't shower often because I have bad memories of when I was younger, I had severe eczema, and my skin would burn and peel when water touched it. I'm terrified of showers now. \n\nI know I have a responsibility to take care of myself, but it's so hard when I'm TRYING but no one seems to care that I'm trying. I also know my boss has been stressed lately, but I feel like she forgot what I told her in January and is snapping at me.\n\nShe also just sent me an email.\n\n\" In January we had conversation about hygiene one that I had been reluctant to have. \u00a0From that conversation I believed that you would rectify the situation. Over the the past few weeks hygiene has become an issue again.\n\nI am not sure if I am able to assist you in figuring out how to go about resolving the problem. What I am sure of is that you are a great member of the team and I want you to continue to work in the office.\"\n\nI'm not even sure I want to be here anymore.

I called my dad crying and he told me it was my fault and that he isn't trying to \"hurt me\". I told him \"I shouldn't have even called anyone.\" and hung up. \n\nI'm just really tired and considering overdosing when I clock out of work today. I have plenty of Zoloft, plenty of BuSpar, and one dose of hydrocodone. I just regret being here because I have my dog here with me on campus. I asked my dad to come and pick me up and he acted like I was asking him to move a mountain for me. Even though I pay for gas and food and bills. So I told him to wait until tomorrow, I just wouldn't go to work tomorrow.\n\nI just really want to die because I feel so awful about myself. I feel like I'm not worthy of love.

Had a teacher that sat me behind a bookshelf from which i wasnt even able to see the blackboard or participate in class because i was \"distracing\" the other children. The teacher videotaped me \"misbehaving\" in class to ridicule my parents and parentsmeetings. I was a smart kid. I was able to write and do basic math before i went to school. I was bored. When i was finished with my stuff I walked through the room and helped the children that were struggling. I dont see any misbehaving in that but maybe im wrong. Final report card was straight A's. Teacher still recommended that i go to a school for idiots. In my country this recommendation is on the report card. When i applied at \"normal\" schools not a single one wanted to teach me because of that recommendation which was just straigh up bullshit. In the end i found a school that saw my potential and didnt care about the recommendation. So i was able to get a decent education.\n\nWhile all of that was happening home was hell. My dad was violent and abusive and my mother never intervened when he punched me in the face etc. i dont know if she did not care or if she was afraid. it doesnt matter to me. I felt and still feel abandoned. \n\nFrom age 9-12 my older brother was raping me over and over. Not like once a  month or something. EVERY SINGLE DAY. sometimes even multiple times. But who should i have asked for help? my father that is violent me? my mother that doesnt do shit? He even invited his friends to watch and spit on me.\n\nWith 14 i had the realization that i wasnt normal anymore. I wasnt talking alot. I stopped enjoying literally anything. Thats also when i started to cut myself.\n\nFast forward to me being 19. I finished school. Got my highschool diploma eventhough i was suffering from severe depression as i found out later. I also had 1 friend. Lets call her L. I got a job over 100 miles away from my parents. I moved out. Lived there in terrible conditions since i made almost no money. But i think i felt better. Im not sure since i was stoned most of the time. After 3 years living away from my parents L tried to commit suicide. I blame myself but i dont want to get into detail of why that is. She survived. I was there for her. I took all my years vacation to be there for her. \n\n6 Months later i live with my parents again since i was breaking down and wasnt able to take care of myself anymore. i admit myself to a mental hospital because i was highly suicidal and L urged me to do it. After i admitted myself L blocked me on all social media up to this day. This was 3 years ago. I stayed 3 months in the hospital and learned alot. I learned that i suffer from depression, paranoia, narcissm, have borderline personality disorder and have symptoms that might be a psychosis but no one can confirm or deny this. I was talking about all the stuff that happened to me. But i learned nothing to cope with that stuff. Or accept it. Or stop thinking about it constantly. \n\nBasically i was worse than before. Everything was fresh in my mind. But no one taught me how to deal with that stuff. But hospital said i was \"healed\".\n\nI moved out from my parents again and got a job in a callcenter since that was the only thing available in my hometown. I got minimum wage, had to have crazy amounts of knowledge, had extreme stats i had to reach or i was laid off and i hated every second. I was sick alot. Like ALOT. Every 2-3 weeks i had something. From colds, flu, migrane etc.\n\nI stayed for a whole year. Eventho i was sick often i had exceptional stats. 99% customer satisfaction with extremely low talk time etc. Then i quit. I couldnt take it anymore. The constant pressure. Knowing that i will never be promoted no matter how good i am. Constant stuggle with money. I was miserable.\n\nSo i went into a different mental hospital. Did dialectic behavioural therapy instead of trauma therapy. Learned to use skills. Which is basically just finding something to occupy your brain so you stop thinking your sick sad thoughts. Does it solve anything? No, not at all. Do i feel better? No.\n\nIn therapy i found a girlfriend. She is perfect. She talks with me. She is understanding. But im struggling so hard since i have this paranoia that literally any person on this planet is just trying to hurt me. I trust her. I know that my thoughts are not real. But it hurts so fucking much. Just a few days ago she got her period. Almost 2 weeks earlier than expected. My thought process to this situation was. \"Well she was partying with her friends last weekend. She probably fucked a dude there, got Plan-B and one the side effects is that your period might come earlier or later than expected.\" Like what the hell? How do you even come up with something like that? I feels like i just want to hurt myself. I should be happy. She is doing everything she can. And i cant appreciate it since my mind is just thinking up storys to hurt me. This literally makes me feel like im insane. Why would i do that to me?\n\nNow im unemployed. Get my money from health insurance. Well for the next week that is. My psychiatrist told me that he wont be writing me sick any longer. He gave me no reason why he wont continue since he is 100% aware of my mental state. That means i dont get any money from my health insurance anymore since they think im healthy. Which means i have to get money from the state for being umemployed. Getting money from the state in my country means that you are required to apply for jobs. For ANY job that the state choses for you. If you dont apply (and show up to interviews or decline a job offer) they wont give you money. Like literally 0.\n\nI cant work. I cant even apply for a job. Im not even able to keep my small flat clean or keep care of myself. \n\nI dont know what to do anymore.

Which involved him stalking me and terrorizing me. Ive been struggling with a eating disorder that whole time. At 19 met my soon to be ex husband he was never abusive just clueless, everything I did was never good enough. Never validated my feelings. I had 5 children from 21-29.

Grades are fucking reverse skyrocketing. I CAN'T get myself to sit down and study shit. I'm probably going to fail music, even although I have been taught music in a music school for about 7 years. I just don't understand some subjects and probably won't at all. Worst part is we are having a trip to Ireland before the summer break, and you are automatically chosen out if you fail 2 or more subjects. I will probably fail French, Music, Spanish, Math, and most likely Physics and chemistry. Now, of all of those I just used to struggle with math BTW.\n\nSo just recently I've started cutting myself again. Not serious wounds straight in the veins. But cuts in my left hand and arm which stay there for quite a while. I will most likely continue doing so as my grades keep coming in. I will most likely get any source of music taken away from me (PC, Mp3, Phone....)

This is the first relationship for both of us. None of us has ever kissed, made out with anyone, etc. And we are both really shy. And I have had friends since the start of the relationship (We've been together for 3 months now) trying to pressure both of us into making out. I, as the coward I am, obviously couldn't make it happen despite her FUCKING TELLING ME SHE WANTS TO. \n\nAnd I've also had quite a high number of suicidal thoughts lately. Mostly think of how could I do it...\nThink of hanging myself, OD to death, find a gun somewhere (not common at all in my country) and blow my head off, cut myself, tie a rope around my neck and stretch it so hard I die, sealing my swimming pool while turning on the water for it to slowly rise and drown me, put a toaster with me in the bath.... I'm quite creative, really....\n\nAlso I've been finding it hard to find reasons to stay alive.

Everyone was supportive that night and my manager got me in contact with the company's employee support fund stuff to put together money for a deposit for a place and anxiety accommodations at work. The next shifts everybody working there behaved as if I wasn't in the same room and would avoid interacting with me. I was fired a few days later and HR did absolutely nothing. I loved that place and made good money but fucked it up in a snap.\n\nI've been homeless on and off and I couldn't get into any shelters with welfare vouchers or go on SNAP/Section 8, etc because I'm one of those DACA people. The good shelters were always full and the social workers would tell me if I know somewhere I can sleep safe, it's better to do that than the overpopulated homeless shelters here in the NY/NJ metro area. So I'd hide in people's backyards and in abandoned buildings in richer towns at night and hang around parks/libraries during the day. My dad offered to pay rent for my own place for now after he found me sleeping in his garage in 15 degree weather thank fuck for that.\n\nDozens of online job apps and irl job apps done and still nothing. Then the thoughts come over and over and I don't know what to do. Prozac makes me act on the thoughts while no prozac makes me tolerate them in a panic. I stay off it and just tolerate panicking and crying it away. I can't afford school and my own place while working full-time and don't have enough money to renew my DACA. Future is fucked up. The one support I got doesn't wanna talk to me and pays to keep me away. Oof. My mind calmed down after turning this into a vent..  \n\n\nTL;DR: Went from mental health recovery and becoming a new person to homeless hot mess without access to welfare or family support.", "Having to rework my suicide plan now that I'm dropping out of college I'm so happy that I'm dropping out but now I got more things to worry about.

I screwed up the trust I've built with my boyfriend who has paranoia.\n\nMy entire life I was afraid of confronting people. I got it from my parents. I would either get yelled at asking for help or they would help. It scared me that I couldn't confront normally as anyone else would. My boyfriend had problems carrying from toxic relationships he's had and I felt like he was bringing it into ours. I wanted to help him but instead of confronting him first I confronted a friend and told them what was up. The promises I've made to him, broken.
